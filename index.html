Arguing that the computer is rewriting the old conceptions of man and his world, it suggests that the telecoms revolution is also a sexual revolution which undermines the fundamental assumptions crucial to patriarchal culture. Historical, contemporary and future developments in telecommunications and in IT are interwoven with the past, present and future of feminism, women and sexual difference, and a wealth of connections, parallels and affinities between machines and women are uncovered as a result. Challenging the belief that man was ever in control of either his own agency, the planet, or his machines, this book argues it is seriously undermined by the new scientific paradigms emergent from theories of chaos, complexity and connectionism, all of which suggest that the old distinctions between man, woman, nature and technology need to be radically reassessed.</p></p><p><p>Sadie Plant is 33.

For more than twenty years, Breedlove and Watson's <em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em> has successfully solved these problems by presenting the most current, definitive, clear, and authoritative introduction to the field. Using stellar examples of today's most exciting research, an unparalleled art program that clarifies even complex biological processes, visual summaries to remind students of the principle findings presented in each chapter, and a comprehensive suite of digital support tools--including animations with built-in assessments that help test the student's knowledge of biological and behavioral processes and neuroanatomy--<em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em>, Ninth Edition, remains the best resource available to teach introductory neuroscience and behavioral neuroscience courses.<br></p><p><br><strong>S. Marc Breedlove </strong>is the Barnett Rosenberg Professor of Neuroscience at Michigan State University.<br> <br><strong>Neil V. Watson</strong> is Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.<br><br>"<em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em> provides a strong foundation upon which clinical psychology students can build their understanding of cognitive, emotional, and physical functional correlates--so important for their future clinical profession!"--Allison Fedio, <em>Argosy University</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em> covers topics regarding the brain and nervous system with lucid explanations and figures. The accompanying supplemental materials are a tremendous asset towards augmenting the students' mastery of the material. The text is straightforward, clear, and useful to both instructors and students from many disciplines. I highly recommend it."--Mario Mata, <em>California State University</em> <br><p></p><br>"This comprehensive text makes neuroscience accessible to a wide range of students. It engages students with cutting edge neuroscientific research findings and research methodology behind the biological basis of behavior."--Sarita Lagalwar, <em>Skidmore College</em><p></p><br>"The breadth of topics, beautiful illustrations, and organization provide students with a solid understanding of neuroscience and the biological bases of behavior."--Stephen Lippi, <em>George Mason University</em> <br><p></p><br>"I am greatly impressed by the authors' ability to present this material to psychology students--who may not have much prior biology background--in a way that makes it engaging and approachable. They include clinical examples without sacrificing accuracy or neglecting to acknowledge the complexities and remaining challenges."--Susan Bachus, <em>University of Maryland, Baltimore County</em> <br><p></p><br>"This book is a comprehensive survey of behavioral neuroscience with strong sections on development, evolution, and hormonal regulation of behavior. Highly detailed information about each topic is organized with emphasis on how behaviors are elicited rather than by anatomical connections. Engaging figures throughout the textbook and visual summaries at the end of each chapter provide high quality illustration of challenging concepts."--Jennifer Wilhelm, <em>College of Charleston</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Lab Manual for Introductory Circuit Analysis</h2><p>The primary objectives of this revision of the laboratory manual include insuring that the procedures are clear, that the results clearly support the theory, and that the laboratory experience results in a level of confidence in the use of the testing equipment commonly found in the industrial environment. <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For those curriculums devoted to a dc analysis one semester and an ac analysis the following semester there are more experiments for each subject than can be covered in a single semester. The result is the opportunity to pick and choose those experiments that are more closely related to the curriculum of the college or university. All of the experiments have been run and tested during the 13 editions of the text with changes made as needed. The result is a set of laboratory experiments that should have each step clearly defined and results that closely match the theoretical solutions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p>Two experiments were added to the ac section to provide the opportunity to make measurements that were not included in the original set. Developed by Professor David Krispinsky of Rochester Institute of Technology they match the same format of the current laboratory experiments and cover the material clearly and concisely. All the experiments are designed to be completed in a two or three hour laboratory session. In most cases, the write-up is work to be completed between laboratory sessions. Most institutions begin the laboratory session with a brief introduction to the theory to be substantiated and the use of any new equipment to be used in the session.</p></p><p></p><h2>Art Heals: How Creativity Cures the Soul</h2><p>The field of art therapy is discovering that artistic expression can be a powerful means of personal transformation and emotional and spiritual healing. In this book, Shaun McNiff, a leader in expressive arts therapy for more than three decades, reflects on a wide spectrum of activities aimed at reviving art's traditional healing function. In chapters ranging from "Liberating Creativity" and "The Practice of Creativity in the Workplace" to "From Shamanism to Art Therapy," he illuminates some of the most progressive views in the rapidly expanding field of art therapy: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The "practice of imagination" as a powerful force for transformation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; A challenge to literal-minded psychological interpretations of artworks ("black colors indicate depression") and the principle that even disturbing images have inherent healing properties <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The role of the therapist in promoting an environment conducive to free expression and therapeutic energies <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The healing effects of group work, with people creating alongside one another and interacting in the studio <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; "Total expression," combining arts such as movement, storytelling, and drumming with painting and drawing</p><p>Shaun McNiff is internationally recognized as a founder and leading figure in the arts and healing field. University Professor at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he is past president of the American Art Therapy Association and the author of several other books including <i>Art As Medicine</i>,<i> Trust the Process</i>, and <i>Creating with Others </i>."Shaun McNiff remains first and foremost an ally of the soul. Here he offers us a stunning array of entry points into the creative process. We learn how to transform the most mundane aspects of life through artistic encounters and to engage with our most painful challenges creatively."&#x2014;Pat B. Allen, Ph.D., ATR, instructor at the school of the Art Institute of Chicago and author of <i>Art Is a Way of Knowing </i> <br><br>"<i>Art Heals </i> restores the therapeutic imagination to its central place in human life. The creative energy of this book will be recognized by all those who have been touched by the healing power of the arts. It is a masterly work by a master in the field of creative and expressive arts therapies."&#x2014;Stephen K. Levine, Dean of the Doctoral Program in Expressive Arts: Therapy, Education, Consulting, at The European Graduate School <br><br>"Shaun McNiff challenges us through these remarkable essays not only to take on the role of artist and dare to create our most compelling images, but also to dialogue with them and by doing so, to engage in a process of healing the inevitable wounds of being human. In a moment in history when the images most available to us are the most horrifying and numbing, McNiff offers a stunning antidote."&#x2014;Robert Landy, Ph.D., RDT/BCT, Professor of Educational Theatre and Drama Therapy, New York University <br><br>"Reading <i>Art Heals </i> is like attending a retrospective exhibition of a master artist, with its careful selection, critique, and contemplation of McNiff's original ideas and guiding images. In refining and reimagining these ideas in the context of today, McNiff brings a fresh vision to his work and offers a valuable answer to the increasingly incoherent fragmentation of mental health care."&#x2014;Lynn Kapitan, Ph.D., ATR-BC, Associate Professor of Graduate Art Therapy of Mount Mary College and author of <i>Re-enchanting Art Therapy </i></p><h2>Jack&#39;s Garden</h2><p>&#34;Building on a rhyme that will be familiar to many children, author-illustrator Cole creates an enticing guide to creating a garden. &#39;This is the garden that Jack planted...&#39; The final illustration presents a satisfied-looking boy surrounded by a lush, bird-filled flower garden....A concluding page of gardening suggestions serves as a springboard to books with more specific guidelines.&#34;--Horn Book.</p><p>Come to the garden that Jack built.

She is restless, curious, and wry. She listens to Black Flag, speaks her mind, and joins her grandmother&#x2019;s fight against mountaintop removal mining almost in spite of herself. &#x201c;I write by ear,&#x201d; says Robert Gipe, and Dawn&#x2019;s voice is the essence of his debut novel, <i>Trampoline</i>. She lives in eastern Kentucky with her addict mother and her Mamaw, whose stance against the coal companies has earned her the community&#x2019;s ire. Jagged and honest, <i>Trampoline</i> is a powerful portrait of a place struggling with the economic and social forces that threaten and define it. Inspired by oral tradition and punctuated by Gipe&#x2019;s raw and whimsical drawings, it is above all about its heroine, Dawn, as she decides whether to save a mountain or save herself; be ruled by love or ruled by anger; remain in the land of her birth or run for her life.</p></p><p>A spectacular debut novel with 221 hand-drawn illustrations.<p><b>Robert Gipe</b> lives in Harlan, Kentucky, and grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee.

No one will read it without reward."<br> --<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>With the same narrative fecundity and imaginative sympathy he brought to his acclaimed retelling of the Greek myths, Roberto Calasso plunges Western readers into the mind of ancient India.

Here are the stories of the creation of mind and matter; of the origin of Death, of the first sexual union and the first parricide. We learn why Siva must carry his father's skull, why snakes have forked tongues, and why, as part of a certain sacrifice, the king's wife must copulate with a dead horse.

Hanh finds answers to these critical problems in the Buddhist teaching of the impermanence of all things. He demonstrates how this teaching can offer inner peace and help us use our collective wisdom and technology to restore the Earth's balance. Mixing inspiring insights with practical strategies, Hanh cites projects his own monastic community has undertaken that can serve as models for any community. Both his " No Car Day," observed once a week, and the "Earth Peace Treaty Commitment Sheet" can impact our ecological footprint on the Earth. Above all, he shows how acceptance of problems is that first critical step toward a deeper understanding of the best way to care for our Earth.<br><br>Includes Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s speech at UNESCO from October 2006 introducing his proposal for a global "No Car Day."<br><br>Foreword by Alan Weisman.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include Happiness and Peace Is Every Step. He lives in Plum Village in southwest France,his meditation and retreat center in France, where he teaches the art of mindful living. <br><br>Alan Weisman is the author of five books, including The World Without Us, an international bestseller translated into more than thirty languages, and Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World. His reports from around the world have appeared in <i>Harper's</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times Magazine</i>, <i>Orion</i>, <i>Wilson Quarterly</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, <i>Discover</i>; and on National Public Radio and in <i>Best American Science Writing</i>. He is a senior radio producer for Homelands Productions, and leads an annual field program in international journalism at the University of Arizona, where he is Laureate Professor in Journalism and Latin American Studies. He and his wife, sculptor Beckie Kravetz, live in western Massachusetts.Past the age of 80 now, the indefatigable Vietnamese Buddhist monk Nhat Hanh continues teaching. As peace flows from Buddhist teachings, so too does an environmental ethic rooted in awareness and interrelatedness. Nhat Hanh's engaged Buddhism, a Buddhist school that emphasizes social responsibility, takes on the task of preserving and protecting the earth. A special bodhisattva (enlightened being)&#x2014;Dharanimdhara, the Earth Holder&#x2014;will guide human efforts to guard and restore the natural world. No effort is too small; an Earth Peace Treaty Commitment Sheet in an appendix lists nearly 60 easy behaviors to minimize ecological impact. The Zen monk's often poetic voice redeems what might otherwise seem repetitive writing or simplistic views; seeing with the eye of the elephant queen provides deep insight. A foreword by environmental journalist Alan Weisman (<i>The World Without Us</i>) adds a fresh framework for understanding Nhat Hanh's Buddhist insights about interrelationships with the natural world. This is an urgent call from a revered spiritual teacher about the moral imperative to treat the earth with respectful awareness. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This one-of-a-kind book is the first to clearly reveal the secrets of Western sex magick without relying on Tantric theory.</p> <p>Straightforward and accessible, this illustrated guide to sex magick shows you how to take your magickal rituals and sexual abilities to amazing new levels.</p> <ul> <li>Reveals for the first time the sexual secrets of the Kabalah dating back to the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem</li> <li>Includes a summary and analysis of the rarest of Crowley's sex magick instructions: "IX?

If it is true, then the question is, "Why?" <br> <br>The answer, quite simply, is that they are drained of magical energy. Note that I said magical energy. In many instances that same man could go out and exercise for hours and be energized &#x2014; not so exhausted that he falls asleep. Why? <br> <br>When I read the manuscript for <i>Modern Sex Magick,</i> it became obvious. In this book, author Donald Michael Kraig reveals that the secret of Kabalistic sex magick is that you must work with the energy raised during sexual excitation. If you don't, it is simply lost. It is that drain of energy which exhausts some men after sex. <br> <br>This is the first book to show the importance of directing the energy and working with it rather than merely focusing on a goal. It is this missing element that puts this book on a level of its own. <br> <br>If that were all this book included, it would be enough. But there is much more that has never been published in one place before. <br> <br>Did you know there was a hidden history of Kabalistic sex magick? It's revealed here. <br> <br>Did you know that men are capable of having multiple orgasms? The technique is in this book. <br> <br>Did you know that all women have the potential to ejaculate like a man? The secrets are shared in this volume. <br> <br>Did you know that extreme sensation and sensory deprivation can make sex magick more powerful? The exact techniques are included here. <br> <br>Put that together with more than ten rituals, beautiful illustrations, the sixteen theorems of magick and sex magick plus Don's famous clear writing style, and you have one of the most important books on the subject ever published. <br><p>Donald Michael Kraig graduated from UCLA with a degree in philosophy. He also studied public speaking and music (traditional and experimental) on the university level. After a decade of personal study and practice, he began ten years of teaching courses in the Southern California area on such topics as Kabalah, Tarot, Magic, Tantra, and Psychic Development. He was a member of many spiritual and magical groups and was an initiated Tantric. <br> </p></p><h2>Peeps at Many Lands: Ancient Rome (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>An introduction to the ancient city of Rome, its early history, and how its geographical position helped it become the seat of the Roman Empire.

ELEVEN MADISON PARK: THE COOKBOOK is a sumptuous tribute to the unforgettable experience of dining in the restaurant. The book features more than 125 sophisticated recipes, arranged by season, adapted for the home cook, and accompanied by stunning full-color photographs by Francesco Tonelli.</p><p>Daniel Humm began his chef's training at 14 in his homeland of Switzerland. There, he earned a Michelin Star while in his first Executive chef position at Gasthaus zum Gupf in the Swiss Alps. In 2003 he moved to the United States to work at Campton Place, where he received many awards, including a nomination for Rising Star Chef by the James Beard Foundation. He has been Executive Chef of Eleven Madison Park since 2006. <br> <b>Will Guidara</b> is a graduate of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. He began his dining room training at Spago Beverly Hills and attended culinary school in the North of Spain. Prior to joining Eleven Madison Park, he served as the director of operations of the restaurants at The Museum of Modern Art. He became general manager of Eleven Madison Park in 2006."Eleven Madison Park is currently one of the most elegant, delicious, and creative restaurants in the country, and the reason for that is the leadership and vision of Chef Humm. He has done what many of us in the culinary world aspire to do: craft an experience that tastes delicious, that is extremely creative, and most importantly, very personal. That is what has made him a leader in the industry and Eleven Madison one of the best restaurants in the country." (<b>Grant Achatz, Alinea, Chicago</b>)<br><br> &#x201c;Chef Daniel Humm has clearly made Eleven Madison Park a culinary destination, continuing to evolve and develop his own personal style. His book elegantly captures the refinement and focus that have always been a hallmark of his cuisine.&#x201d; (<b>Thomas Keller, The French Laundry, Yountville</b>)<br><br> &#x201c;It is quite a privilege to have Daniel Humm in New York, not just as one of our great chefs, but also as a great friend. His delicate cuisine is so well portrayed in this book, which showcases the passion and genuine talent of a modern chef.&#x201d; (<b>Daniel Boulud, Daniel, New York City</b>)<br><br>"I have always thought of Daniel as a humble, unpretentious, understated character with a sharp, clever, and generous sense of humor. Dining at his legendary restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, not only did I have the feeling of being in a quintessentially New York space, but I also found that the food reflected his character. Eating delicious food that makes you smile and laugh, while reflecting and simply having a good time, is special. We can all indulge in this same experience page by page in his book." (<b>Rene Redzepi, Noma, Copenhagen</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;[Chef Humm&#x2019;s] creations have audacity without excess. Page after page, Daniel invites us to discover his world where the kitchen is at the heart of a wonderful journey.&#x201d; (<b>Michel Troisgros, Maison Troisgros, Roanne</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Daniel is a great chef, embodying everything that the term represents. His creativity, his dedication to the cuisine, his love of the ingredients, and his vision of the culinary world make him count among the greatest of his generation.&#x201d; (<b>Yannick All�no, Le Meurice, Paris</b>)</p><h2>In the Best Interest of Students: Staying True to What Works in the ELA Classroom</h2><p>What is in the best interest of our students? Is it teaching to the newest standards movement, like the Common Core? Teaching that prepares students to take a test? Or is it something more meaningful and authentic?<br> In his new book,&nbsp;<i>In the Best Interest of Students</i>, Kelly Gallagher notes that there are real strengths in the Common Core standards, and there are significant weaknesses as well. He takes the long view, reminding us that standards come and go but what remains constant is the need to stay true to what we know works in the teaching of reading, writing, speaking and listening. Instead of blindly adhering to the latest standards movement, Kelly advocates:<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialing up the amount of reading and writing students are doing.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balancing rigorous, high-quality literature and non-fiction with high-interest, student-selected titles.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving students much more choice when it comes to reading and writing activities.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encouraging readers to deepen their comprehension by moving beyond the &#x201c;four corners of the text.&#x201d;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using modeling to enrich students&#x2019; writing skills in the prewriting, drafting, and revision stages.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping young writers to achieve more authenticity through the blending of genres.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resisting the de-emphasis of narrative and imaginative reading and writing.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing students with more opportunities to sharpen their listening and speaking skills<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning lessons that move beyond Common Core expectations.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this provocative and insightful new book, Kelly surveys the teaching landscape since the publication of his highly regarded book&nbsp;<i>Readicide</i>, and finds that although some progress has been made, more needs to be done. Amid the frenzy of trying to teach to a new set of standards, Kelly Gallagher is a strong voice of reason, reminding us that instruction should be anchored around one guiding question: What is in the best interest of our students?</p><p><p>Kelly, a "baseballoholic" and a self-described expert at negotiating airports, is in his 33rd&nbsp;year of teaching at the high school level.</p><p>He currently teaches at Magnolia High School in Anaheim, California.</p><p>He believes that "there is no greater pleasure than teaching someone something." Teaching is "artistic, it matters a great deal, and I can never get the job down perfectly."</p><p>Kelly thinks that professional development should treat teachers as such - professionals. "I know in the classroom that good things happen when my students have meaningful discussions. I know as a teacher myself that my craft sharpens when I am given the opportunity to have meaningful discussions with my peers. And let's have a laugh or two while we are at it."</p><p>Writing his six books for Stenhouse was a solitary experience. "Though I have written outlines prior to each of my books, I have yet to follow any of them step-by-step. That is why I find writing rewarding - because the act of writing itself generates new thinking, and new thinking is always exciting."</p></p><h2>Learning to Think Things Through: A Guide to Critical Thinking Across the Curriculum</h2><p><p> <b>For Freshman Orientation or Critical Thinking courses as well as a supplementary text for use in any subject-matter at any educational level.</b>&nbsp;<b>This concise,&nbsp;effective guide is designed to help students learn to think critically in <i>any</i> subject-matter.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Learning to Think Things Through </i>presents a&nbsp;combination of instruction and exercises that shows the reader how to become <i>active learners</i> rather than passive recipients of information, use critical thinking to more fully&nbsp;appreciate the power of the discipline they are studying, to see its connections to other fields and to their day-to-day lives, and to maintain an overview of the field so they can see the parts in terms of the whole.

Four years later he fought off the armies of the Third Crusade, which were commanded by Europe&#x2019;s leading monarchs. A fierce warrior and savvy diplomat, Saladin&#x2019;s unparalleled courtesy, justice, generosity, and mercy were revered by both his fellow Muslims and his Christian rivals such as Richard the Lionheart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Combining thorough research with vivid storytelling, Jonathan Phillips offers a fresh and captivating look at the triumphs, failures, and contradictions of one of the Crusades&#x2019; most unique figures. Bringing the vibrant world of the twelfth century to life, this book also explores Saladin&#x2019;s complicated legacy, examining the ways Saladin has been invoked in the modern age by Arab and Muslim leaders ranging from Nasser in Egypt, Asad in Syria, and Saddam Hussein in Iraq to Osama bin Laden, as well as his huge appeal across popular culture in books, drama, and music.</p><p><b>Jonathan Phillips </b>is professor of the history of the Crusades at Royal Holloway, University of London. He is the author of <i>Holy Warriors: A Modern History of the Crusades </i>and <i>The Second Crusade</i>.

Today political figures often inspire little admiration, but Saladin's career at the height of the crusades reminds us that moral charisma and integrity can be recognized and honored by people on both sides of a vicious conflict.&nbsp; Jonathan Phillips's account is balanced and fair; he does not present the great Kurdish sultan as a paragon but Saladin's remarkable career should challenge the widespread Western perception of Islam as an atavistically violent faith. Phillips&nbsp; reminds us that Saladin took Jerusalem from the Christians in 1187 with a clemency and forbearance that was in sharp contrast with the hideous bloodshed of the Crusaders' conquest of the Holy City in 1099. His concluding account of the intense emotion that the memory of Saladin still inspires in the Middle East today reveals the sensitivity and pain that underlies so many of the region's unresolved problems.&#x201d;&#x2014;Karen Armstrong,&nbsp;author of <i>A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam</i><br>&#x201c;This breathtaking biography of the Ayyubid conqueror&nbsp;Saladin&nbsp;exceeds all others both in its erudition and in its brilliant analysis of Saladin&#x2019;s modern representations in the political mobilization of Islam.&#x201d;&#x2014;William Chester&nbsp;Jordan, author of <i>The Apple of His Eye:&nbsp; Converts from Islam in the Reign of Louis IX</i><br></p><h2>The Pentateuch: Interpreting Biblical Texts Series (Intepreting Biblical Texts)</h2><p>In this volume, Terence E.

The two chapters of Part One provide an orientation to the critical study of the Pentateuch and present a proposal for reading the Pentateuch in terms of its rhetorical strategy. That strategy, Fretheim argues, is designed in such a way as to have a certain effect upon its readers, most basically to shape their faith and life.

Here, we see Wallander on his homicide first case as a twenty-one-year-old patrolman, as a young father facing unexpected danger on Christmas Eve, as a middle-aged detective with his marriage on the brink, as a newly separated investigator solving the brutal murder of a local photographer, and finally as a veteran detective, with his signature methodical and instinctive work style, discovering unexpected connections between a downed plane and the assassination of a pair of spinster sisters. In these five riveting tales we watch Kurt Wallander come into his own not only as a detective but as a human being</p><p>Internationally bestselling novelist and playwright Henning Mankell has received the German Tolerance Prize and the U.K.&#x2019;s Golden Dagger Award and has been nominated for a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize three times. His Kurt Wallander mysteries have been published in thirty-three countries and consistently top the bestseller lists in Europe. He divides his time between Sweden and Maputo, Mozambique, where he has worked as the director of Teatro Avenida since 1985.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>FOREWORD<br></b>&nbsp;<br>It was only after I had written the eighth and final installment in the series about Kurt Wallander that I thought of the subtitle I had always sought but never found. When everything, or at least most of it, was over I understood that the subtitle naturally had to be "Novels about the Swedish Anxiety."<br>&nbsp;<br>But of course I arrived too late at this insight. And this despite the fact that the books have always been variations on a single theme: "What is happening to the Swedish welfare state in the 1990s? How will democracy survive if the foundation of the welfare state is no longer intact? Is the price of Swedish democracy today too high and no longer worth paying?"<br>&nbsp;<br>And it is precisely these questions that have also been the subject of the majority of the letters I have received. Many readers have had wise thoughts to share. Indeed I feel confirmed in my impression that Wallander has in a way served as a kind of mouthpiece for growing insecurity, anger, and healthy insights about the relationship between the welfare state and democracy. There have been thick letters and slender postcards from places around the world that I have never heard of, telephone calls that have reached me at odd hours, agitated voices that have spoken to me via e-mail.<br>&nbsp;<br>Beyond these matters of the welfare state and democracy, I have also been asked other questions. Some of them have been in regards to inconsistencies that many readers have gleefully discovered. In almost all cases in which readers have brought "errors" to light, they have been correct. (And let me immediately add that new inconsistencies will be discovered even in this volume. Let me simply say that what appears in this volume is what should stand. Let no shadow fall upon any editor. I could not have had a better one than Eva Stenberg.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But most of the letters have posed the following question: what happened to Wallander before the series began? Everything, to set an exact date, before January 8, 1990. The early winter morning when Wallander is awakened in his bed by a telephone call, the beginning of <i>Faceless Killers</i>. I have a great sympathy for the fact that people wonder how it all began. When Wallander appeared on the scene he was forty-two, going on forty-three. But by then he had been a policeman for many years, he had been married and divorced, had a child, and, once upon a time, had left Malm� for Ystad.<br>&nbsp;<br>Readers have wondered. And naturally I have also sometimes wondered. During these past nine years I have sometimes cleaned out drawers, dug through dusty piles of paper, or searched among the ones and zeroes of diskettes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Several years ago, right after I was done with the fifth book, <i>Sidetracked</i>, I realized that I had started to write stories in my head that took place long before the start of the series. Again, this magical date, January 8, 1990.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now I have gathered these stories. Some have already been published in newspapers. Those I have gone over lightly. Some chronological errors and dead words have been excised. Two of the stories have never been published before.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I am not publishing these stories now to clean out my desk. I am publishing this volume because it forms an exclamation mark to the period I wrote last year. In the manner of the crab, it can sometimes be good to go backward. To a beginning. The time before January 8, 1990.<br>&nbsp;<br>No picture will ever be complete. But I do think these pieces should be part of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The rest is, and remains, silence.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Henning Mankell</i><br><i>January 1999</i></p><h2>Looking for Home (Volume 1) (Beyond the Orphan Train)</h2><p>With his mother dead, his father gone, and his older brothers and sisters unable to help, eight-year-old Ethan Cooper knows it&#x2019;s his responsibility to keep him and his younger siblings together&#x2014;even if that means going to an orphanage.<br><br> Ethan, Alice, Simon, and Will settle into the Briarlane Christian Children&#x2019;s Home, where there&#x2019;s plenty to eat, plenty of work, and plenty of talk about a Father who never leaves.

After graduating from Vassar College in 1923, she moved first to New York City and then to Paris, where she founded her own publishing company. The Domino Press introduced American readers to artists from all over the world.

Those who possess a toxic faith have stepped across the line from a balanced perspective of God to an unbalanced faith in a weak, powerless or uncaring God. They seek a God to fix every mess, prevent every hurt, and mend every conflict.<br><i><br>Toxic Faith</i> distinguishes between a healthy faith and a misguided religiosity that traps believers in an addictive practice of religion. It shows how unbalanced ministries, misguided churches, and unscrupulous leaders can lead their followers away from God and into a desolate experience of religion that drives many to despair. <i>Toxic Faith</i> shows readers how to find hope for a return to genuine, healthy faith that can add meaning to life. In the words of the author, &#x201c;I want to help you throw out that toxic faith and bring you back to the real thing.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Stephen Arterburn</b> is the founder and chairman of New Life Clinics, which provide Christian counseling and treatment throughout the United States.

For fifteen years Curry has ruled supreme, as his men have pulled jobs from Canada to Mexico. But the king is getting old... he wants to turn his legacy over to someone younger, tougher. Mike Bastian is Ben's adopted son, a young man who can handle a knife, a gun, his fists, but a man who's never broken the law.<br><br> Now, as treachery explodes among Ben's riders, and two honest lawmen&#x2014;Tyrel Sackett and Borden Chantry&#x2014;begin to zero in on the gang, Mike must choose...between his loyalty to Ben and his yearning for a different life. Yet when the guns start echoing off the Vermilion Cliffs, the time for choosing is over&#x2014;and the time for battle has begun.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>The winter snows were melting in the forests of the Kaibab, and the red-orange Vermilion Cliffs were streaked with melting frost. Deer were feeding in the forest glades among the stands of ponderosa and fir, and trout were leaping in the sun-sparkled streams. A shadow moved under the ponderosa, then was gone.<br><br>Five deer fed on the grass along the bank of a mountain stream back of Finger Butte, their coats mottled with the light and shadow of sunlight through the leaves.<br><br>It was very still. Water rippled around the roots of a tree where the soil had washed away, and gurgled cheerfully among the rocks. A buck's tail twitched, twitched again, and the regal head lifted, turning its nostrils to the wind, reading it cautiously, but the reading was betrayal, for the shadow under the pines was downwind of him.<br><br>A faint breeze sifted through the grass and stirred the leaves, and with the breeze the shadow moved into the sunlight and became a man, standing motionless not twenty feet from the nearest deer.<br><br>Straight and tall he stood in gray buckskins. He wore no hat, and his hair long. Lean and brown, his black hair loose, he waited until the buck's head lifted again, looking right at him.<br><br>A startled snort and the buck sprang away. The others followed. Mike Bastian stood with his hands on his hips, watching them go.<br><br>Another man came through the trees behind him, a lean, wiry old man with a gray mustache and blue eyes alive with humor.<br><br>"What do you think of that, Roundy?" Bastian asked. "Could your Apache beat that? Another step and I could have touched him."<br><br>Roundy spat into the grass. "No Apache I ever knowed could do better, son. An' I never seen the day I could do as well. You're good, Mike, really good. I am surely glad you're not huntin' my hair!" He drew his pipe from his pocket and began stoking it. "We're headin' back for Toadstool Canyon, Mike. Your pa sent for us."<br><br>"No trouble, is there?"<br><br>"None I know of, although things don't look good. They don't look good at all. No, I think your pa figures it's time you rode out with the bunch."<br><br>Mike Bastian squatted on his heels, glancing around the glade. This was what he liked, and he did not want to leave. Nor did he like what he was going back to face. "I believe you're right, Roundy. Pa said I was to ride out in the spring when the boys went, and it is about time."<br><br>He tugged a blade of grass and chewed on it. "I wonder where they will go this time?"<br><br>"Whatever it is, and wherever it is, it will be well planned. Your pa would have made a fine general, boy. He's got the head for it. He never forgets a thing."<br><br>"You've been with him a long time, haven't you?"<br><br>"Mighty long. I was with him before he found you. I met him in Mexico during the War, longer ago than I care to remember. I was just a youngster then, myself."<br><br>From the grass he took up a fallen pine cone. "Son! Look!" He tossed the pine cone into the air.<br><br>Mike Bastian palmed his gun and it belched flame, then again. The second shot spattered the pine cone into flying brown chips.<br><br>"Not bad," Roundy said, "but you shot too quick. You've got to get over that, Mike. Most times one shot is all you'll get."<br><br>Side by side they started back through the woods. The earth was spongy with a thick bed of pine needles. An occcasional break in the trees offered a glimpse of the far-off San Francisco peaks, with clouds shrouding their summits. Roundy was not as tall as the younger man, but he walked with the long, easy stride of the woodsman. Coming to a break in the forest that permitted them a long view of the wild, broken canyon country to the east, Roundy spoke. "Your pa picked mighty well. Nobody in God's world could find him in all that."<br><br>"There's Indians," Bastian reminded, "and some of the Mormons know that country."<br><br>"He doesn't bother them and they don't bother him," Roundy said. "That's why his outfit needs a tight rein."<br><br>They walked on, in silence. Several times Bastian paused to study the ground, reading the tracks to see who or what had passed since they had passed. "This here is somethin' you better not do again," Roundy suggested, "comin' back the way we went out. Somebody could be layin' for us."<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"Ah, now. That's the question. Nobody is supposed to know your pa's plans for you, but there's always the chance somebody might. Believe me, son, nothin' is a secret for long, an' you can just bet some of the boys have been doin' some thinkin' about you."<br><br>They paused again, studying the country around, and Roundy put the question that had been bothering him for months. "Mike? If Ben's ready for you to go out, what will you do?"<br><br>"Go, I guess. What choice do I have?"<br><br>"You're sure? You're sure you want to be an outlaw?"<br><br>"Wasn't that why he raised me? To take over from him?" There was an edge of bitterness in Mike's tone. "Wasn't I to take over when Ben Curry stepped aside?"<br><br>"That's what you were raised for, all right." Roundy poked at the pine needles with his toe. "But it's your life you have to live. Ben Curry can't live it for you, and you can't live his life for him, no matter how much he wants it.<br><br>"The thing to remember, Mike, is that things have changed since Ben an' me rode into this country together. It's no longer wild and free like it was. Folks are movin' in, settlin' the country, buildin' homes.<br><br>"Getaways won't be so easy no more, and the kind of men you ride with will change. Fact is, they have already changed.<br><br>"When Ben an' me rode into this country it was wide open. Most banks had been mighty hard on a poor man, ready to foreclose at the slightest chance, and the railroads gave all the breaks to the big cattle shippers, so nobody cared too much if a train was robbed or a bank. If you killed somebody, especially a man with a wife and kids--well, that was something else. If you just robbed a bank or train the posses would chase you more for fun than actually to catch you. It was a break in the work they were doin'. They'd get out, run an outlaw for a while but not too serious about it.<br><br>"Kill a man? That was different. They'd chase you for keeps then, and they'd catch you. That's why Ben Curry wouldn't stand for killin', an' he's been known to personally kill a man who disobeyed that order."<br><br>"He actually did?"<br><br>"Seen it myself. It was Dan Peeples, and Dan was a high hand with a gun. They'd robbed a bank in Wyoming an' as they were ridin' out of town this young feller came out of an alley, blundered right in the way, and Dan Peeples shot him.<br><br>"Folks seen it. Folks knew it was deliberate. Well, we rode on three, four miles an' Ben pulled up. He turned to Dan Peeples an' he said, 'I said no killin', Dan.'<br><br>"Dan, he just grinned an' said, 'Well, he got in the way. Anyway, what's one farm kid, more or less?'<br><br>"Ben Curry said, 'When I say no killin', I mean it.'<br><br>"Dan, he says, 'So?' And Ben shot him. Dan saw it comin' and reached but he was too slow, so Ben left him layin' there for the posse to find."<br><br>"What if they got cornered?"<br><br>"That was different. If they had to fight their way out, well an' good, an' a time or two that happened. Your pa was against needless killin', an' the word got around. The outlaws knew it, but the townsfolk, ranchers, an' lawmen knew it, too."<br><br>"I've heard some of the stories."<br><br>"No way you could miss. Ben Curry's kind breed stories. In them old days many a man rustled a few head to get started, and sometimes a broke cowhand would stand up a stage and nobody took it too serious, but it isn't like that anymore. The country is growin' up and changing viewpoints. More than that, it is Ben himself."<br><br>"You think he's too big?"<br><br>"What else? Your pa controls more country than there is in New York State! Right under his thumb! And he's feared over much of the west by those who really know about him, but not many do.<br><br>"Outside of his own crowd nobody has seen Ben Curry in years, at least, not to know who he was. Mighty few know his power, although there's a rumor around that somewhere there lives a man who rides herd on more than a hundred outlaws. Much of his success lies in the fact that nobody believes it.<br><br>"His men ride out and meet at a given point. They ride alone or in pairs, never more than three together at a time until the job is pulled, then they break up an' scatter.<br><br>"He plans ever' job himself, with maybe one or two settin' in. He's scouted or had the job scouted by somebody he can trust. It is planned, rehearsed, then done.<br><br>"Mostly folks lay the robberies to driftin' cowhands, to Jesse James or somebody else. He pulls jobs anywhere from Canada to Mexico, and from San Antone to Los Angeles."<br><br>Roundy started off along the trail. "He's been the brains, all right, but don't ever forget it was those guns of his kept things in line. Lately, he hasn't had to use his guns. Kerb Perrin, Rigger Molina, or somebody else will handle discipline. He's become too big, Ben Curry has. He's like a king, and the king isn't gettin' any younger."<br><br>He stopped in the trail and turned around. "How d'you suppose Perrin will take it when he hears about you takin' over? You think he'll stand still for that?"<br><br>"I doubt if he will," Mike said thoughtfully. "I imagine he's done some planning on his own."<br><br>"You can bet he has! So has Molina, and neither one of them will stop at murder to get what they want. Your pa still has them buffaloed, I think, but that won't matter when the showdown comes. And I figure the time has come."<br><br>"Now?" Mike was incredulous.<br><br>"Mike, I never told you, and I know Ben hasn't, but Ben has a family."<br><br>"A family?" Mike Bastian was shocked. "But I--!"<br><br>"He has a wife and two daughters, and they have no idea he's an outlaw. Wouldn't believe it if you told 'em. Their home is down near Tucson someplace, but occasionally they come to a ranch he owns in Red Wall Canyon, a ranch supposedly owned by Voyle Ragan. Ben visits them there."<br><br>"Who else knows this?"<br><br>"Nary a soul, and don't you be tellin' anyone. Ben, he always wanted a son, and never had one, so when your real pa was killed down at Mesilla, Ben took you to raise. That was nigh onto eighteen years ago, and since then he's spent a lot of time an' thought on you. A long time later he told me he was going to raise you to take over whatever he left."<br><br>"What about my real father? My family?"<br><br>Roundy shrugged. "I never did get the straight of that, and there may be other stories. The way I heard, it was your real pa was killed by 'Paches whilst you was off in the brush somewhere. They come down, killed your pa, stole your horses, and looted the wagon. They were bein' chased by soldiers out of El Paso or somewhere an' it was a sort of hit-an'-run thing. The soldiers brought you back to town an' Ben took you to raise."<br><br>"Kind of him."<br><br>"Yes, it was. Not many men would do such a thing, them days. Most of them just didn't want the responsibility or wouldn't take the time. For several years it was just you an' him, an' he tried to teach you everything he knew.<br><br>"Look at it. You can track like an Apache. In the woods you're a ghost, and I doubt if old Ben Curry himself can throw a gun as fast and accurate as you. You can ride anything that wears hair, an' what you don't know about cards, dice, roulette, and all the rest of it, nobody knows. You can handle a knife, fight with your fists, and open anything made in the way of safes and locks.<br><br>"Along with that he's seen you got a good education, so's you can handle yourself in any kind of company. I doubt if any boy ever got the education and training you've had, and now Ben is ready to step back an' let you take over."<br><br>"So he can join his wife and daughters?"<br><br>"Uh-huh. He just wants to step out of the picture, go somewhere far off, and live a quiet life. He's gettin' no younger and he wants to take it easy in his last years. You see, Mike, Ben's been afraid of only one thing. That's poverty. He had a lot of it as a youngster. I reckon that was one reason he taken you to raise, he knowed what you were up against, if you lived at all.<br><br>"Now he's made his pile, but he knows he can't get out alive unless he has somebody younger, stronger, and smarter to take control of what he's built. That's where you come in."<br><br>"Why not let Perrin have it?"<br><br>"You know the answer to that. Perrin is mean and he's dangerous. He'd have gone off the deep end long ago if it hadn't been for Ben Curry. He's a good second man but a damn poor leader. That goes for Molina, too. He'd have killed fifty times if he hadn't known that Ben would kill him when he got back.<br><br>"No, neither could handle it, and the whole shootin' match would go to pieces in sixty days left to either of them. More than that, a lot of people would get killed, inside an' outside the gang."<br><br>Little of what Roundy was saying was new to Bastian, yet he was curious as to why the old man was saying it. The two had been together a lot and knew each other as few men ever did. They had gone through storm, hunger, and thirst together, living in the desert and mountains, returning only occasionally to the rendezvous in Toadstool Canyon.<br><br>Obviously there was purpose in Roundy's bringing up the subject, and Bastian waited, listening. Over the years he had learned that Roundy rarely talked at random. He spoke when he had something to say, something important. Yet even as they talked he was aware of all that was about him. A quail had moved into the tall grass near the stream, and ahead of them a squirrel moved in the crotch of a tree, and only minutes ago a gray wolf had crossed the path where they walked.<br><br>Roundy had said he was a woodsman, and it was true that he felt more at home in the woods and wild country than anywhere else. The idea of taking over the leadership of the outlaws filled him with unease. Always he had been aware that this time would come, and he had been schooled for it, but until now it had always been pleasantly remote. Now, suddenly, it was at hand.<br><br>Was he afraid of responsibility? Or was he simply afraid? Searching his thoughts he could find no fear. As for responsibility, he had been so prepared and conditioned for his role that it was a natural step.<br><br>He thought of Kerb Perrin and Rigger Molina. Was he afraid? No, he was not. Both men had been tolerant and even friendly when he was a boy, Molina especially. Yet as he grew older and became a man they had withdrawn. Did they realize the role that he was being prepared for?<br><br>They knew him, but how much did they know? None of them had seen him shoot, for example. At least, none that he knew.<br><br>Roundy interrupted his thoughts by stopping to study the country ahead. "Mike," Roundy said, "the country is growing up. Last year some of our raids raised merry hell, and the boys had a hard time getting away. Folks don't like having their lives disrupted, and when the boys ride out this year they will be riding into trouble.<br><br>"Folks don't look at an outlaw as they used to. He isn't regarded as some wild youngster full of liquor and excess energy. He's a bad man, dangerous to the community, and he's stealing money folks have saved.<br><br>"Now they see an outlaw like a wolf, and every man will be hunting him. Before you go into this you'd better think it over, and think seriously.<br><br>"You know Ben Curry, and I know you like him, as well you should. He did a lot for you. At the same time, Ben had no right to raise you to be an outlaw. He chose his own way, of his own free will, but you should be free to do the same.<br><br>"No man has a right to say to a...</p><h2>Daughter Zion: Meditations on the Church&#39;s Marian Belief</h2><p>Daughter Zion explores the biblical witness to the Church's Marian dogmas- Mary's role as Mother of God, her virginity, the Immaculate Conception, and her Assumption into heaven. Cardinal Ratzinger examines how these beliefs are linked to the Church&#x2019;s faith in Jesus Christ. Far from competing with the truth about Christ, the Church&#x2019;s Marian beliefs uphold and underscore that truth. <p>Mary&#x2019;s role in salvation, according to Cardinal Ratzinger, was anticipated in the Old Testament. She was prefigured in Eve, the Mother of the Living; in the holy women of the Old Testament, such as Sarah, Hannah, Deborah, Esther, and Judith; and in the prophetic image of the daughter Zion. Cardinal Ratzinger also considers Mary&#x2019;s place as the embodiment of created wisdom, who faithfully received the Uncreated Wisdom of the World of God in the Incarnation. </p><p>Daughter Zion avoids the extremes of denying any biblical foundation for Marian doctrine on the one hand and fundamentalistic proof-texting on the other. Instead, the author beautifully and lucidly develops key biblical themes to help readers understand and appreciate the Mother of God.</p></p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Dealing in Desire: Asian Ascendancy, Western Decline, and the Hidden Currencies of Global Sex Work</h2><p>This captivating ethnography explores Vietnam&#x2019;s sex industry as the country ascends the global and regional stage. Over the course of five years, author Kimberly Kay Hoang worked at four exclusive Saigon hostess bars catering to diverse clientele: wealthy local Vietnamese and Asian businessmen, Viet Kieus (ethnic Vietnamese living abroad), Western businessmen, and Western budget-tourists. <i>Dealing in Desire</i> takes an in-depth and often personal look at both the sex workers and their clients to show how Vietnamese high finance and benevolent giving are connected to the intimate spheres of the informal economy. For the domestic super-elite who use the levers of political power to channel foreign capital into real estate and manufacturing projects, conspicuous consumption is a means of projecting an image of Asian ascendancy to potential investors. For Viet Kieus and Westerners who bring remittances into the local economy, personal relationships with local sex workers reinforce their ideas of Asia&#x2019;s rise and Western decline, while simultaneously bolstering their diminished masculinity. <i>Dealing in Desire</i> illuminates Ho Chi Minh City&#x2019;s sex industry as not just a microcosm of the global economy, but a critical space where dreams and deals are traded.</p><p>&#x201c;This extraordinary work is pathbreaking, substantively, theoretically, and methodologically. It powerfully explores the socially co-constitutive and critical cultural role of Vietnam&#x2019;s multi-tiered sex industry in its bourgeoning global economic sector. Hoang simultaneously dissects competing hierarchies of race, gender, and nation in the pursuit of multinational deals and masculine desires. It upends traditional trafficking studies of Asian sex workers as victims, presenting them instead as shrewd entrepreneurs and creative agents of their own lives. A methodological tour de force. Malinowskian in scope, depth, daring, and technical virtuosity, this will remain the standard by which sociological fieldwork in other societies will be judged for years to come.&#x201d;&#x2015;Orlando Patterson, John Cowles Professor of Sociology, Harvard University, and coeditor of&nbsp;<i>The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth </i><br><br> &#x201c;Eye-opening and ground-breaking. Kimberly Kay Hoang&#x2019;s tour-de-force ethnography inhabits and crosses multiple domains of desire-making to showcase the mutual construction of masculinities, financial deal-making, and transnational political-economic identities. Through the innovative frame of desire as a force of production, this work dismantles the problematic analytic binaries of &#x201c;culture&#x201d; and &#x201c;economy.&#x201d; Specifically, by viscerally analyzing the role of confidence, the production of hierarchical status, and the buttressing of failure &#x2013; which are all premised on particular performances of feminine submission &#x2013;in creating the conditions of possibility for investment (and individual) potentials, Hoang delivers what many works have only promised. That is, that embodiment, inequality, and intimacy construct social economies. Differential masculinities and women&#x2019;s roles in brokering these differences while making space for their own life projects are the currencies of market development and action. Rarely ever has the relationship between desire, work, capital, and national identity been so viscerally articulated.&nbsp; Truly an intrepid, captivating ethnography.&#x201d;&#x2015; Karen Ho, author of<i> Liquidated: An Ethnography of Wall Street</i><br><br> &#x201c;Boldly linking global political and economic transformations to intimate transactions, Hoang&#x2019;s <i>Dealing in Desire</i> offers a transformative account and novel analysis of sex work. A welcome contribution to gender studies and the economy of intimacy, the book will interest a wide audience.&#x201d;&#x2015;Viviana A. Zelizer, Lloyd Cotsen &#x2019;50 Professor of Sociology at Princeton University, and author of <i>The Purchase of Intimacy</i> and<i> Economic Lives</i><br><br> &#x201c;In<i> Dealing in Desire</i>, Hoang shows us how to look at the micro to learn about the macro. Her rich ethnographic account of the sexual industries in Vietnam situates our understanding of sex work in a larger political economy as it illustrates how race, nation, and class produce multiple masculinities and femininities.&#x201d;&#x2015;Rhacel Salazar Parre�as, author of&nbsp;<i>Servants of Globalization: Women, Migration, and Domestic Work</i><p><i><i>&#x201c;</i></i><i>Dealing in Desire&nbsp;</i>is obviously an exceptionally courageous book given the challenging fieldwork Hoang engaged in. But equally importantly, it is a very astute book that connects different modes of presentation of the body by Vietnamese karaoke girls to specific organizational contexts and to macro structural transformations in East Asia. The book stands out as a signal contribution to the new sociology of transnationalism.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michele Lamont, Director, Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Dignity of Working Men</i><br><br> "<i>Dealing in Desire</i> is a stunning book &#x2013; an exemplar of what global ethnography should be. It knits together global finance, colonial fantasy, and national identity in its exploration of the stratified sex work industry of Ho Chi Minh City. Bridging macro and micro processes, it shows us that sex work is about far more than sex. It is about desire for status, anxieties about masculinity and downward mobility, and economic competition. Through this remarkable ethnography we are able to see sex work as a dense site where both clients and workers navigate and negotiate hierarchies of race, class, and gender to enhance their position in the global political economy."&#x2015;Raka Ray, Professor and Chair of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley and author of <i>Cultures of Servitude: Modernity, Domesticity and Class in India</i><br><br><i>"Dealing in Desire</i> is easily the most deeply researched and rigorously argued book ever written about the Vietnamese sex industry and it is surely one of the most authoritative studies currently available on the sociological dynamics of sex work in the current era of accelerated globalization.&nbsp; For a piece of serious academic scholarship, it is also a remarkably gripping read."&#x2015;Peter Zinoman, Professor of History and Southeast Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley<br><br> "<i>Dealing in Desire</i> is the most extraordinary ethnography I have read in years. At a time when ethnographers in sociology seem inclined to write sensationalist accounts designed for mass appeal, Hoang represents the relationship between sexual and economic relations in Vietnam with exceptional thoughtfulness, methodological self-reflection, and theoretical sophistication. The book beautifully examines the relationships among masculinity, femininity, power, sexuality, and financial transactions among Western and Vietnamese women and men, making clear the many ways that sex workers and their clients or patrons manipulate their relations to meet complex personal and economic needs. Hoang&#x2019;s approach is masterful.&nbsp; She respects her subjects enough to avoid feeding two most common tropes in common representations of Asian sex workers, the exotic doll and the helpless victim. And she respects her readers enough to challenge us with a complex yet consistently engaging narrative. <i>Dealing in Desire</i> is a triumph."&#x2015;Mario Luis Small,&nbsp; Grafstein Family Professor, Harvard University, and author of <i>Unanticipated Gains: Origins of Network Inequality in Everyday Life</i><br> &nbsp;</p><b>Kimberly Kay Hoang</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology and the College at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Social Studies Content for Elementary and Middle School Teachers</h2><p>Are you feeling a little rusty with your social studies content knowledge?

Her books have been translated into more than forty languages. She lives in London and Istanbul with her family.<p></p><p>Of all the people God created and Sheitan led astray, only a few have discovered the Centre of the Universe&nbsp;&#x2013; where there is no good and no evil, no past and no future, no &#x2018;I&#x2019; and no &#x2018;thou&#x2019;, no war and no reason for war, just an endless sea of calm. What they found there was so beautiful that they lost their ability to speak.</p><p>The angels, taking pity on them, offered two choices. If they wished to regain their voices, they would have to forget everything they had seen, albeit a feeling of absence would remain deep in their hearts. If they preferred to remember the beauty, however, their minds would become so befuddled that they would not be able to distinguish the truth from the mirage. So the handful who stumbled upon that secret location, unmarked on any map, returned either with a sense of longing for something, they knew not what, or with myriads of questions to ask. Those who yearned for completeness would be called &#x2018;the lovers&#x2019;, and those who aspired to knowledge &#x2018;the learners&#x2019;.</p><p>That is what Master Sinan used to tell the four of us, his apprentices. He would regard us closely, his head cocked to one side, as if trying to see through our souls. I knew I was being vain, and vanity was unfit for a simple boy such as I, but every time my master would relate this story I believed he intended his words for me rather than for the others. His stare would linger for a moment too long on my face, as if there were something he expected from me. I would avert my gaze, afraid of disappointing him, afraid of the thing I could not give him&nbsp;&#x2013; though what that was I never figured out. I wonder what he saw in my eyes. Had he predicted that I would be second to none with respect to learning, but that I, in my clumsiness, would fail miserably in love?</p><p>I wish I could look back and say that I have learned to love as much as I loved to learn. But if I lie, there could be a cauldron boiling for me in hell tomorrow, and who can assure me tomorrow is not already on my doorstep, now that I am as old as an oak tree, and still not consigned to the grave?</p><p>There were six of us: the master, the apprentices and the white elephant. We built everything together. Mosques, bridges, madrasas, caravanserais, alms houses, aqueducts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was so long ago that my mind softens even the sharpest features, melting memories into liquid pain. The shapes that float into my head whenever I hark back to those days could well have been drawn later on, to ease the guilt of having forgotten their faces. Yet I remember the promises we made, and then failed to keep, every single one of them. It&#x2019;s odd how faces, solid and visible as they are, evaporate, while words, made of breath, stay.</p><p>They have slipped away. One by one. Why it is that they perished and I survived to this feeble age only God and God alone knows. I think about Istanbul every day. People must be walking now across the courtyards of the mosques, not knowing, not seeing. They would rather assume that the buildings around them had been there since the time of Noah. They were not. We raised them: Muslims and Christians, craftsmen and galley slaves, humans and animals, day upon day. But Istanbul is a city of easy forgettings. Things are written in water over there, except the works of my master, which are written in stone.</p><p>Beneath one stone, I buried a secret. Much time has gone by, but it must still be there, waiting to be discovered. I wonder if anyone will ever find it. If they do, will they understand? This nobody knows, but at the bottom of one of the hundreds of buildings that my master built rests hidden the centre of the universe.</p><p>Agra, India, 1632</p><p></p><p></p><p>Istanbul, 22 December 1574</p><p>It was past midnight when he heard a fierce growl from the depths of the dark. He recognized it immediately: it came from the largest cat in the Sultan&#x2019;s palace, a Caspian tiger with amber eyes and golden fur. His heart missed a beat as he wondered what&nbsp;&#x2013; or who&nbsp;&#x2013; could have disturbed the beast. They should all be sound asleep at so late an hour&nbsp;&#x2013; the humans, the animals, the djinn. In the city of seven hills, other than the watchmen on the streets making their rounds, only two kinds of people would be awake now: those who were praying and those who were sinning.</p><p>Jahan, too, was up and about&nbsp;&#x2013; working.</p><p>&#x2018;Working is prayer for the likes of us,&#x2019; his master often said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the way we commune with God.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then how does He respond to us?&#x2019; Jahan had once asked, way back when he was younger.</p><p>&#x2018;By giving us more work, of course.&#x2019;</p><p>If that were to be believed, he must be forging a rather close relationship with the Almighty, Jahan had thought to himself, since he toiled twice as hard to ply two trades, instead of one. He was a mahout and a draughtsman. Dual crafts he pursued, yet he had a single teacher whom he respected, admired and secretly wished to surpass. His master was Sinan, the Chief Royal Architect.</p><p>Sinan had hundreds of students, thousands of labourers and many more adherents and acolytes. For all that, he had only four apprentices. Jahan was proud to be among them, proud but, inwardly, also confused. The master had chosen him&nbsp;&#x2013; a simple servant, a lowly elephant-tamer&nbsp;&#x2013; when he had plenty of gifted novices at the palace school. The knowledge of this, instead of swelling his self-esteem, filled him with apprehension. It preyed on his mind, almost despite himself, that he might disappoint the only person in life who believed in him.</p><p>His latest assignment was to design a hamam. The master&#x2019;s specifications were clear: a raised marble basin, which would be heated from below; ducts inside the walls to allow the smoke to exit; a dome resting on squinches; two doors opening on to two opposite streets so as to prevent men and women from seeing one another. On that ominous night, this was what Jahan was working on, seated at a rough-hewn table in his shed in the Sultan&#x2019;s menagerie.</p><p>Leaning back, frowning, he inspected his design. He found it coarse, devoid of grace and harmony. As usual, drawing the ground plan had been easier than drawing the dome. Though he was past forty&nbsp;&#x2013; the age when Mohammed had become Prophet&nbsp;&#x2013; and skilled in his craft, he still would rather dig foundations with his bare hands than have to deal with vaults and ceilings. He wished there could be a way to avoid them altogether&nbsp;&#x2013; if only humans could live exposed to the skies, open and unafraid, watching the stars and being watched by them, with nothing to hide.</p><p>Frustrated, he was about to start a new sketch&nbsp;&#x2013; having pilfered paper from the palace scribes&nbsp;&#x2013; when he again heard the tiger. His back stiffened, his chin rose as he stood transfixed, listening. It was a sound of warning, bold and bloodcurdling, to an enemy not to draw any closer.</p><p>Quietly, Jahan opened the door and stared into the surrounding gloom. Another snarl rose, not as loud as the first but just as menacing. All at once, the animals broke into a clamour: the parrot screeched in the dark; the rhinoceros bellowed; the bear grunted in angry response. Nearby the lion let out a roar, which was met with a hiss from the leopard. Somewhere in the background was the constant, frantic thumping that the rabbits made with their hind legs whenever they were terrified. Though only five in number, the monkeys raised the racket of a battalion&nbsp;&#x2013; screaming, bawling. The horses, too, began to whinny and shuffle about in their stables. Amid the frenzy Jahan recognized the elephant&#x2019;s rumble, brief and listless, reluctant to join the tumult. Something was frightening the creatures. Throwing a cloak on to his shoulders, Jahan grabbed the oil lamp and slipped into the courtyard.</p><p>The air was crisp, tinged with a heady perfume of winter flowers and wild herbs. No sooner had he taken a couple of steps than he noticed some of the tamers huddled together under a tree, whispering. When they saw him coming, they glanced up expectantly. But Jahan did not have information, only questions.</p><p>&#x2018;What is happening?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The beasts are nervous,&#x2019; said Dara the giraffe-tamer, sounding nervous himself.</p><p>&#x2018;It might be a wolf,&#x2019; Jahan suggested.</p><p>It had happened before. Two years ago. One bitter winter eve, wolves had descended on the city, prowling the neighbourhoods of Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. A few had crept in through the gates, God knew how, and attacked the Sultan&#x2019;s ducks, swans and peacocks, creating mayhem. For days on end they had had to clear bloody feathers from under the bushes and brambles. Yet now the city was neither covered in snow nor was it exceptionally cold. Whatever it was that was agitating the animals, it came from inside the palace.</p><p>&#x2018;Check every corner,&#x2019; said Olev the lion-tamer&nbsp;&#x2013; a hulk of a man with flaming hair and a curling moustache in the same shade. Not a single decision was taken around here without his knowledge. Mettlesome and muscular, he was held in high regard by all the servants. A mortal who could command a lion was someone even the Sultan could admire a little.</p><p>Scattering hither and thither, they inspected the barns, stables, pens, pounds, coops and cages to make sure no animal had escaped. Every resident of the royal menagerie seemed to be in its place. Lions, monkeys, hyenas, flat-horned stags, foxes, ermines, lynxes, wild goats, wildcats, gazelles, giant turtles, roe deer, ostriches, geese, porcupines, lizards, rabbits, snakes, crocodiles, civets, the leopard, the zebra, the giraffe, the tiger and the elephant.</p><p>When he went to see Chota&nbsp;&#x2013; a thirty-five-year-old, six cubits tall and unusually white Asian male elephant&nbsp;&#x2013; Jahan found him high-strung, unsettled, holding out his ears like sails to the wind. He smiled at the creature whose habits he knew so well.</p><p>&#x2018;What is it? You smell danger?&#x2019; Patting the elephant&#x2019;s side, Jahan offered him a handful of sweet almonds, which he always carried ready in his sash.</p><p>Never refusing a treat, Chota popped the nuts into his mouth with a swing of his trunk as he kept his gaze on the gate. Leaning forward, his massive weight on his front legs, his sensitive feet pasted to the ground, he froze, straining to catch a sound in the distance.</p><p>&#x2018;Calm down, it&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; intoned Jahan, though he did not believe in what he said and nor did the elephant.</p><p>On the way back, he saw that Olev was talking to the tamers, urging them to disperse. &#x2018;We searched everywhere! There&#x2019;s nothing!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But the beasts&nbsp;&#x2013;&#x2019; someone protested.</p><p>Olev interjected, pointing at Jahan. &#x2018;The Indian is right. Must have been a wolf. Or a jackal, I&#x2019;d say. Anyway, it&#x2019;s gone. Get back to sleep.&#x2019;</p><p>No one protested this time. Nodding, murmuring, they trudged to their pallets, which, though coarse and prickly and full of lice, were the one safe and warm place they knew. Only Jahan lingered behind.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re not coming, mahout?&#x2019; called Kato the crocodile-tamer.</p><p>&#x2018;In a moment,&#x2019; Jahan replied, glancing in the direction of the inner courtyard, where he had just heard a curious muffled sound.</p><p>Instead of turning left, towards his shed of lumber and stone, he turned right, towards the high walls separating the two yards. He walked warily, as if waiting for an excuse to change his mind and go back to his drawing. Upon reaching the lilac tree at the furthest end, he noticed a shadow. Dusky and unearthly, it so resembled an apparition that he would have dashed away had it not just then turned aside and showed its face&nbsp;&#x2013; Taras the Siberian. Surviving every disease and disaster, he had been here longer than anyone else. He had seen sultans come, sultans go. He had seen the mighty humbled and the heads that used to carry the loftiest turbans rolled in mud. Only two things are solid, the servants taunted: Taras the Siberian and the misery of love. Everything else perishes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x2018;Is that you, Indian?&#x2019; Taras asked. &#x2018;The animals woke you up, eh?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah,&#x2019; Jahan said. &#x2018;Did you just hear a noise?&#x2019;</p><p>The old man gave a grunt that could have been a yes or a no.</p><p>&#x2018;It came from over there,&#x2019; Jahan insisted, craning his neck. He stared at the wall stretching before him, a shapeless mass the colour of onyx, blending seamlessly into the dark. In that moment he had the impression that the midnight haze was full of spirits, moaning and mourning. The thought made him shudder.</p><p>A hollow crash reverberated across the yard, followed by a cascade of footsteps, as if a throng of people was scampering about. Deep from the bowels of the palace, a woman&#x2019;s scream rose, too wild to be human, and almost at once was stifled into a sob. From a different corner another scream ripped through the night. Perhaps it was a lost echo of the first one. Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell into stillness. On impulse, Jahan made a motion towards the wall in front of him.</p><p>&#x2018;Where are you going?&#x2019; whispered Taras, his eyes glittering with fright. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s forbidden.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I want to find out what&#x2019;s going on,&#x2019; said Jahan.</p><p>&#x2018;Keep away,&#x2019; said the old man.</p><p>Jahan hesitated&nbsp;&#x2013; albeit momentarily. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll take a look and come back right away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t do that, but you won&#x2019;t listen,&#x2019; said Taras with a sigh. &#x2018;Just make sure you don&#x2019;t go further. Stay in the garden, your back close to the wall. D&#x2019;you hear me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, I shall be quick&nbsp;&#x2013; and careful.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll wait for you. Won&#x2019;t sleep till you return.&#x2019;</p><p>Jahan gave an impish smile. &#x2018;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t do that, but you won&#x2019;t listen.&#x2019;</p><p>Recently Jahan had worked with his master in the repair of the royal kitchens. Together they had also expanded parts of the harem&nbsp;&#x2013; a necessity, since its population had grown considerably over the last years. So as not to have to use the main gate, the labourers had made a shortcut, carving out an opening in the walls. When a consignment of tiles had been delayed, they had sealed it with unbaked bricks and clay.</p><p>A lamp in one hand, a stick in the other, Jahan tapped on the walls as he ambled along. For a while he heard only the same dull thud, over and over again. Then an empty thump. He stopped. On his knees he pushed the bricks at the bottom with all his might. They resisted at first, but eventually gave way. Leaving his lamp behind, intending to pick it up on the way back, he crawled through the hole and into the next courtyard.</p><p>The moonlight cast an eerie glow over the rose garden, now a rose cemetery. The bushes, adorned with the brightest red and pink and yellow throughout spring, looked withered, burnished, spreading out like a sea of silver water. His heart was pounding so fast and so loud he was afraid someone might hear it.

With a fresh and fantastical band of characters, he carries us back to the decadent squalor of New Crobuzon&#x2014;this time, decades later.</b><br> <b><br> </b>It is a time of wars and revolutions, conflict and intrigue. New Crobuzon is being ripped apart from without and within. War with the shadowy city-state of Tesh and rioting on the streets at home are pushing the teeming city to the brink. A mysterious masked figure spurs strange rebellion, while treachery and violence incubate in unexpected places.<br><br> In desperation, a small group of renegades escapes from the city and crosses strange and alien continents in the search for a lost hope.<br><br> In the blood and violence of New Crobuzon&#x2019;s most dangerous hour, there are whispers. It is the time of the iron council. . . .<br><br> The bold originality that broke Mi�ville out as a new force of the genre is here once more in <i>Iron Council</i>: the voluminous, lyrical novel that is destined to seal his reputation as perhaps the edgiest mythmaker of the day.</p><p>China Mi�ville's novel <i>Iron Council</i> is the tumultuous story of the "Perpetual Train." Born from monopolists' greed and dispatched to tame the western lands beyond New Crobuzon, the train is itself the beginnings of an Iron Council formed in the fire of frontier revolt against the railroad's masters. From the wilderness, the legend of Iron Council becomes the spark uniting the oppressed and brings barricades to the streets of faraway New Crobuzon. The sprawling tale is told through the past-and-present eyes of three characters. The first is Cutter, a heartsick subversive who follows his lover, the messianic Judah Low, on a quest to return to the Iron Council hidden in the western wilds. The second is Judah himself, an erstwhile railroad scout who has become the iconic golem-wielding hero of Iron Council's uprising at the end of the tracks. And the third is Ori, a young revolutionary on the streets of New Crobuzon, whose anger leads him into a militant wing of the underground, plotting anarchy and mayhem. <p> Mi�ville (<i>The Scar</i>, <i>Perdido Street Station</i>) weaves his epic out of familiar and heavily political themes--imperialism, fascism, conquest, and Marxism--all seen through a darkly cast funhouse mirror wherein even language is distorted and made beautifully grotesque. Improbably evoking Jack London and Victor Hugo, <i>Iron Council</i> is a twisted frontier fable cleverly combined with a powerful parable of Marxist revolution that continues Mi�ville's macabre remaking of the fantasy genre. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p><b>China Mi�ville</b> was born in 1972.

Assisted by Becker's sage advice, students can make better sense of their research and simultaneously generate fresh ideas on where to look next for new data. The tricks cover four broad areas of social science: the creation of the "imagery" to guide research; methods of "sampling" to generate maximum variety in the data; the development of "concepts" to organize findings; and the use of "logical" methods to explore systematically the implications of what is found. Becker's advice ranges from simple tricks such as changing an interview question from "Why?" to "How?" (as a way of getting people to talk without asking for a justification) to more technical tricks such as how to manipulate truth tables.<br> <br> Becker has extracted these tricks from a variety of fields such as art history, anthropology, sociology, literature, and philosophy; and his dazzling variety of references ranges from James Agee to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Becker finds the common principles that lie behind good social science work, principles that apply to both quantitative and qualitative research. He offers practical advice, ideas students can apply to their data with the confidence that they will return with something they hadn't thought of before.<br> <br> Like <i>Writing for Social Scientists, Tricks of the Trade</i> will bring aid and comfort to generations of students. Written in the informal, accessible style for which Becker is known, this book will be an essential resource for students in a wide variety of fields.<br> <br> "An instant classic. . . .

Alice&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;contributing editor at <i>Playboy.</i> For many years she was the magazine&#x2019;s fiction editor and is the creator of the College Fiction Contest.<br>In an arresting journey through the netherworld, Playboy fiction editor Turner explores the landscape and dynamics of Hell as envisioned by writers, artists, theologians and thinkers from Plato and Augustine to Milton, Calvin, Byron and T. S. Eliot. Starting with the worlds of the dead of the Sumerians, Egyptians, Zoroastrians, Greeks, Romans and Jews, Turner moves on to the sketchy biblical basis for Christian Hell and its increasing importance in thinking about the afterlife. After the fact of Hell was settled, it was up to writers like Bede, Gregory the Great and most of all Dante to give the graphic descriptions of an infernal region where the wicked endure torments. Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire poured cold water on the idea of Hell, yet, as Turner shows, Hell, far from disappearing in the 20th century, has been one of its central metaphors. Scores of intriguing black-and-white plates reveal how Bosch, Giotto, William Blake, Michelangelo, Rodin and others have shaped popular images of the underworld. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>Turner, the fiction editor of Playboy magazine, takes the reader on more of a geographical than a theological tour of hell. She begins her examination of the concept of hell in ancient Middle Eastern and Mediterranean societies, tracing its evolution into that held by the Christian Church. She considers the devil such a complex subject that he remains peripheral to her discussion. The study emphasizes the depiction of hell by such artists as Virgil, Dante, Michelangelo, Milton, and Blake and the bewildering assortment of hells within the history of Christianity. Turner remains alert to the humor lurking behind many depictions of hell, such as in medieval mystery plays. Her scholarship is thorough but not obtrusive.

Crinkleroot--a curious old codger with a long white beard and hiking stick--provides young readers with clear, accurate information on some habits of wildlife common to the northeastern United States. His short discourses are accompanied by precisely-drawn illustrations showing the tracks of each animal or bird. Each creature's habitats and unusual habits are included, as well. The text in this new edition has been somewhat condensed, and, in the process, some interesting material has been removed (i.e., the otter's diet). The inclusion of a table of contents, an index, and numbered pages, however, makes the revision more accessible. The illustrations, except for the one on the cover, are unchanged, but some have been colored (the original was illustrated in black line tinted with gray and brown). In several illustrations in which a blue tint is used to highlight various black-line tracks in snow scenes, the printing of the color is a bit off, making recognition of the tracks more difficult than in the black-line originals. In short, this attractive new edition, although a worthy addition to most collections, need not replace the earlier one. Other books on animal tracking are Millicent Selsam's How to Be a Nature Detective (Harper, 1966), a brief introduction to tracking aimed at a younger audience, and David Webster's Track Watching (Watts, 1972; o.p.) for upper grade readers. --Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, Ohio<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>English Country House Murders: Classic Crime Fiction of Britain&#39;s Upper Crust</h2><p>Nothing could seem more civilized, more orderly and sedate than a weekend at one of Great Britain&#39;s country estates.

His work has been translated into more than thirty languages.He lives in Brooklyn, New York.The moon as a poetic and planetary influence over earthly affairs runs as a theme, wittily ransacked, throughout this elegant fiction by award-winning novelist and poet Auster ( The New York Trilogy ; The Invention of Solitude ). Marco Fogg is a loner and a dreamer, whose "mind is on the moon," and who in a state of elation unfolds moonlore to his friends. The year of the moon landing finds Fogg living in spartan reclusivity until forced from his New York apartment to roam as a Central Park vagrant. His rescue by Kitty Wu, a gentle Chinese girl, leads to their poignant and tenuous love. Like some of Auster's earlier protagonists, Fogg senses he has a kindred, submerged or vanished other self. Here, it is Fogg's father, who went into eclipse before his birth; the quest for the parent forms a narrative thread. When Fogg serves as reader/companion to the elderly cripple Barber, aka "Effing," who recounts his adventures in a Western wilderness where he buried a cache of paintings, Fogg's fate takes an unexpected turn.

There&#x2019;s Toshi, the dependable one; Terauchi, the great student; Yuzan, the sad one, grieving over the death of her mother&#x2014;and trying to hide her sexual orientation from her friends; and Kirarin, the sweet one, whose late nights and reckless behavior remain a secret from those around her. When Toshi&#x2019;s next-door neighbor is found brutally murdered, the girls suspect the killer is the neighbor&#x2019;s son, a high school boy they nickname Worm. But when he flees, taking Toshi&#x2019;s bike and cell phone with him, the four girls get caught up in a tempest of dangers&#x2014;dangers they never could have even imagined&#x2014;that rises from within them as well as from the world around them.<br><br>Psychologically intricate and astute, dark and unflinching, <i>Real World </i>is a searing, eye-opening portrait of teenage life in Japan unlike any we have seen before.</p><p><b>Natsuo Kirino, </b>born in 1951, is the author of eighteen novels, four short-story collections, and an essay collection. She is the recipient of six of Japan&#x2019;s premier literary awards, including the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for <i>Out</i> and the Izumi Kyoka Prize for Literature for <i>Grotesque.</i> Her work has been translated into nineteen languages, and several of her books have been turned into movies. <i>Out</i> was the first of her novels to appear in English and was nominated for an Edgar Award. She lives in Tokyo.Chapter OneNinna Hori<br><br>I&#x2019;m penciling in my eyebrows when the smog alert siren starts blaring. It&#x2019;s happened every day since summer vacation started, so it&#x2019;s no surprise. &#x201c;May I have your attention,&#x201d; this woman&#x2019;s voice drawls over a loudspeaker. &#x201c;An air pollution advisory has just been issued,&#x201d; and the siren continues to drone on, like some kindly old dinosaur groaning away.<br><br>Most of these advisories happen in the morning, usually just as I&#x2019;m about to leave for cram school. Nobody does anything because of them. Everyone kind of goes, Oh, <i>that</i> again. What I&#x2019;d like to know is where they hide those speakers. To me, that&#x2019;s creepier and weirder than anything about smog.<br><br>I live in a crowded residential area on the outskirts of Suginami-ku in Tokyo. It used to be a nice, laid-back neighborhood, but all the old, larger houses got torn down, replaced by smaller single-family homes and apartments. When I was little, several neat but tiny buildings went up where there used to be plum orchards and farm fields. They slapped fancy names on these&#x2014;<i>Estates</i> or whatever&#x2014;to help sell units. Nice-looking families moved in, and on weekends you&#x2019;d see them out walking their dogs or driving around in expensive foreign cars. But the paved roads that run through the neighborhood, which must have been just dirt farm paths at one time, are so narrow that I heard the family two houses down from us had so much trouble parking their Mercedes-Benz in their garage that they ended up getting rid of it.<br><br>The siren keeps on droning. Right in between one of its groans, I hear a loud sound, something breaking next door. Our houses are so close that if you open the window, you can hear the parents yelling at each other, or the phone ringing. I&#x2019;m thinking maybe a window broke. Seven years ago the boy who lives in the house diagonally across from us kicked a soccer ball that shattered a window in our house in the room where we keep our Buddhist altar. The kid completely ignored what happened, and later on he was transferred to a school in Kansai. I remember the abandoned soccer ball sitting there under the eaves of my house forever.<br><br>Anyway, the sound I&#x2019;d heard was just like that time. There aren&#x2019;t any little kids living next door, so it&#x2019;s weird to hear something shatter so loudly, and the whole thing was kind of alarming. Maybe a burglar broke in. My heart beating like mad, I listened carefully but didn&#x2019;t hear anything else. Total silence.<br><br>The neighbors moved in two years ago. We&#x2019;ve had hardly anything to do with them. Sometimes, when I take the neighborhood association bulletin to them, I&#x2019;ll press the intercom bell and the mother will come out, this phony smile pasted on her face. All I know for sure is that there&#x2019;s a mom and a dad, and a boy the same age as me who lives there. Sometimes the mother is out front, sweeping with a bamboo broom. She has on silver-framed glasses and this bright red lipstick you know is going to leave marks on any teacup she uses. Get rid of the glasses and the lipstick, though, and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d recognize her.<br><br>Once when the woman next door saw me in my school uniform she asked, &#x201c;Are you a high school student?&#x201d; When I said yes, she said, &#x201c;So is our son,&#x201d; and named the prestigious high school he attended, smiling happily. When I told my mom this, she clicked her tongue and looked disgusted. The woman was obviously bragging about her son and Mom must have thought she was insulting us, since I was going to a less-than-stellar private girls&#x2019; school. But I just thought the woman next door was simple and naive, and I felt sorry for the boy for having such an embarrassing mother.<br><br>This son of hers was a lanky, stoop-shouldered boy with small, gloomy eyes. Reminded me of a worm. He had a sluggish way of walking with his head tilted to one side, and zero in the way of spirit. Even when our paths happened to cross at the station he&#x2019;d avoid looking at me and edge off into the shadows of the building. Like if he stepped into the shadows he could hide from the world. In that sense he was just like his father, who looked like a typical office worker. The father ignored me as if I didn&#x2019;t even exist. Once I went out to get the evening paper when he was just coming home. I nodded to him but he gazed off into the distance like I was invisible.<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder what that guy does for a living, anyway,&#x201d; my mother once said. &#x201c;Kind of stuck-up with that ascot of his.&#x201d; Who cares about ascot ties? was my reaction. To me people are divided into two groups: the nice and the un-nice. And the family next door was definitely in the second category. If my grandmother were still alive she would have sniffed out all kinds of gossip about them, but my mother couldn&#x2019;t be bothered, so the only details we knew about them were that their son looked like a worm, the mother wore red lipstick, and the father, an ascot.<br><br>Still, I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what that sound was. A burglar could break into their house for all I cared, but I didn&#x2019;t want him coming into ours. I started to panic. My parents were both at work, I had slept in late and was about to have some cup ramen before heading out to summer cram school&#x2014;I was a senior in high school&#x2014;and the last thing I wanted was for some burglar to flee into our place. Dad always said that the scariest thing was a thief who gets cornered and turns violent.<br><br>I heard another crash, this one louder than the first. It rang in my ears, and I flinched and messed up my left eyebrow. Maybe I should redo it, I was thinking, staring into the mirror, when my cell phone on the table buzzed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yo!&#x201d; It could only be Terauchi. &#x201c;Dude, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just heard this weird sound from next door&#x2014;maybe a robber or something. What should I do?&#x201d;<br><br>But Terauchi wasn&#x2019;t paying any attention.<br><br>&#x201c;That essay on Mori Ogai we&#x2019;re supposed to write? I&#x2019;ve done over a hundred pages, right? Just kidding . . . But I think it&#x2019;s going to turn out okay, know what I mean?&#x201d; She rambled on like this for a minute or so.<br><br>&#x201c;Terauchi. <i>Listen</i> to me. A burglar might have broken into the house next door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Du&#x2014;de</i>!&#x201d; Terauchi was finally surprised and her usual greeting now turned into an interjection. Terauchi was a cute-looking girl, but her voice was really low and cool. Among my friends, she was the smartest and the most interesting.<br><br>&#x201c;I just heard glass shattering,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Someone breaking in, maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably just the husband and wife having a fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At this time of the morning?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The guy next door should be at work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, maybe the wife lost it and smashed a teacup or something. It&#x2019;s gotta be that,&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;You know, one time when my mom got into a fight with my dad&#x2019;s mother she went nuts and tossed both of their teacups and plates out the second-story window.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your mom&#x2019;s kind of extreme.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got that right,&#x201d; Terauchi said. &#x201c;She just casually tossed the plates and cups out, aiming at the stepping-stones in the garden. See, Dad was using the plates Yukinari used as a baby. Anyway, Toshi-chan, I wanted to see how you&#x2019;re doing with your essay.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Toshi-chan</i>. My name&#x2019;s Toshiko Yamanaka, the characters for <i>Toshi</i> meaning &#x201c;ten and four,&#x201d; because I was born on the fourth day of the tenth month, October. Obviously not a lot of thought went into naming me, but since I&#x2019;ve hardly ever met anyone with the same characters, I don&#x2019;t mind the name that much. Terauchi&#x2019;s first name is Kazuko, which she can&#x2019;t stand. Her grandfather in Akita gave her the name, apparently. My friends all call one another by their first names or by nicknames, except for Terauchi, who insists that we call her by her last name.<br><br>&#x201c;The thing is, I haven&#x2019;t done it yet,&#x201d; I admitted.<br><br>When we got to be seniors our Japanese teacher assigned us to write an essay on Ogai&#x2019;s story &#x201c;The Dancing Girl.&#x201d; Terauchi was always good at exams and assignments. Whenever we had to write a book report, she copied parts of some published essay on the book without the teachers ever catching on. I was a little too honest&#x2014;honest to a fault, you could say&#x2014;to try to get away with something like that. So unfortunately it took me a lot of time to finish up assignments and my grades were never as good as hers. I never thought of what she did as dishonest; I was kind of vaguely worried that someday her cleverness might really her get in trouble. I worried about her because I liked her so much.<br><br>She went on, rumbling in her low voice: &#x201c;I was thinking of, like, doing a psychological analysis of the main character.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Including Elise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah&#x2014;not her. Her name&#x2019;s in katakana. What&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;Oda?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have a clue what she was talking about.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it,&#x201d; a different voice replied. Now it was Yuzan on the phone. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gonna do a psychological profile based on the Chinese characters used to write the name. Can you imagine getting away with that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yuzan, I didn&#x2019;t know you were there,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>I must have sounded a little disappointed. I wasn&#x2019;t exactly happy to find out that she and Terauchi were hanging out without me. It made me feel left out. I really liked Terauchi, but Yuzan was harder to deal with. She had such extreme likes and dislikes. She hated smokers violently, for instance. Human garbage, she said. Which was kind of unfair from the smoker&#x2019;s viewpoint. On the other hand, if she liked someb...</p><h2>The Practical Handbook of Homeopathy: Safe, Effective Home Prescriptions for Common Conditions</h2><p>Increasingly, people are turning to homeopathy and they&#x2019;re eager to know more about what&#x2019;s safe and effective.

Filled with compelling drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight, <i>Palace Of Desire</i> is the unforgettable story of the violent clash between ideals and realities, dreams and desires.</p><p>Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. A student of philosophy and an avid reader, his works range from reimaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Over a career that lasted more than five decades, he wrote 33 novels, 13 short story anthologies, numerous plays, and 30 screenplays. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of <b>Palace Walk</b> (1956), <b>Palace of Desire</b> (1957), and <b>Sugar Street</b> (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer in Arabic to do so. He died in August 2006.1<br><br>AL-SAYYID AHMAD Abd al-Jawad closed the door behind him and crossed the courtyard of his house by the pale light of the stars. His step was lethargic, and his walking stick sank into the dusty earth whenever he leaned on it wearily. He felt on fire and craved cold water so he could wash his face, head, and neck and escape, if only briefly, from the July heat and from the inferno in his belly and head. Cheered by the thought of cool water, he smiled. When he entered the door leading to the stairway, he could see a faint light coming from above. It flowed along the wall, revealing the motion of the hand that held the lamp. He climbed the steps with one hand on the railing and the other on his stick. Its successive taps had long ago acquired a special rhythm, which identified him as easily as his features. Amina was visible at the head of the stairs with the lamp in her hand. On reaching her, he stopped to regain his breath, for his chest was heaving. Then he greeted her in his customary way: "Good evening."<br><br>Preceding him with the lamp, Amina murmured, "Good evening, sir."<br><br>Once inside his room he rushed to the sofa and collapsed. Letting go of his stick and taking off his fez, he threw his head back and stretched out his legs. The sides of his cloak fell open, and the caftan underneath rode up to reveal the legs of his long underwear tucked into his socks. He shut his eyes and wiped his forehead, cheeks, and neck with a handkerchief.<br><br>After placing the lamp on a table, Amina waited for him to rise so she could help remove his clothes. She looked at him with anxious concern. She wished she had the courage to ask him not to stay out so late &#x2014; now that his health could no longer shrug off excesses &#x2014; but she did not know how to express her sad thoughts. <br><br>A few minutes passed before he opened his eyes. Then he extracted the gold watch from his caftan and took off his diamond ring to place them both in his fez. When he stood up to remove his cloak and caftan with Amina's assistance, his body seemed as tall, broad, and full as ever, although the hair at his temples had been assailed by gray. When he was putting his head in the neck of his white house shirt, a smile suddenly go the better of him. He remember how Mr. Ali Abd al-Rahim had vomited at their party that evening and had apologized for his weakness, attributing it to an upset stomach. They had all singled out their friend, upbraiding him and asserting that he could no longer tolerate alcohol, for only a special kind of man could keep on drinking to the end of his life, and so forth. He remembered he anger and vehemence of Mr. Ali in defending himself against this suspicion. How amazing that some people lent importance to such trivial matters. . . . But if it were not important, then why had he himself boasted in the merry hubbub that he could drink a whole tavern of wine without ill effects?<br><br>He sat down again and lifted his feet so that his wife could take off his shoes and socks. Then she disappeared briefly, returning with a basin and a pitcher. <br>She poured the water for him while he washed his face and neck and rinsed out his mouth. Afterwards he sat with his legs folded beneath him, enjoying the gentle breeze flowing between the latticed balcony and the window overlooking the courtyard.<br><br>"What an atrocious summer we're having this year!"<br><br>Pulling the pallet out from under the bed and sitting cross-legged at his feet, Amina replied, "May our Lord be gracious to us." She sighed and continued: "The whole world's a blazing pyre, especially the oven room. The roof terrace is the only place you can breathe in summer &#x2014; once the sun has set."<br><br>She sat there as usual, but time had changed her. She had grown thin, and her face seemed longer, if only because her cheeks were hollow. The locks of hair that escaped from her scarf were turning gray and made her seem older than she was. The beauty spot on her cheek had grown slightly larger. In addition to their customary look of submission, her eyes now revealed a mournful absent-mindedness. Her anguish over the changes that had befallen her was considerable, although at first she had welcomed them as an expression of her grief. Then she had begun to wonder anxiously if she might not need her health to get through the remainder of her life. Yes. . .&nbsp; and the others needed her to be healthy too, but how could everything be put back the way it was before? And she was older, if not old enough to warrant such a transformation. Still, her age had to make a difference.<br><br>Night after night she had stood on the balcony observing the street through the wooden grille. What she could see of the street had not altered, but change had crept through her.<br><br>The voice of the waiter at the coffeehouse echoed through their silent room. She smiled and stole a glance at al-Sayyid Ahmad.<br><br>She dearly loved this street, which stayed awake all night keeping her heart company. It was a friend but ignorant of the heart that loved it through the shutters of the enclosed balcony. Its features filled her mind, and its evening inhabitants were live voices inhabiting her ears &#x2014; like this waiter who never stopped talking, the person with the hoarse voice who commented on the events of the day without getting tired or annoyed, the man with the nervous voice trying his luck at cards with the seven of diamonds and the jack, and the father of Haniya &#x2014;the little girl with whooping cough &#x2014; who night after night would reply when asked about her, "Our Lord will be able to cure her." Oh . . . the balcony seemed to be her special corner of the coffeehouse. Memories of the street paraded before her imagination while her eyes remained fixed on the man's head, which was leaning against the back of the sofa.&nbsp; When the flow of remembered images stopped, she concentrated her attention on her husband. She noticed that the sides of his face were bright red, the way she had grown accustomed to seeing them of late when he returned home. She was uncomfortable about it and asked him apprehensively, "Sir, are you well?"<br><br>He held his head up and muttered, "Well, praise God." Then he added, "But the weather is atrocious."<br><br>Clear raisin liqueur was the best drink in summer. That was what they had repeatedly told him, but he could not stand it. For him it was whiskey or nothing. Thus every day he had to put up with summer hangovers, and it was a ferocious summer. He had really laughed hard that evening. He had laughed until the veins of his neck were sore. But what had all the laughter been about? He could hardly remember. There seemed to be nothing to relate or repeat. Yet the atmosphere of their party had been charged with such a sympathetic electricity that a touch had sufficed to set off a flash. The moment Mr. Ibrahim al-Far said, "Alexandria set sail from Sa'd Zaghlul Pasha today heading for Paris," reversing his words, they had all burst out laughing, since they considered that remark an exquisite example of a slip of the tongue caused by intoxication. <br><br>They had been quick to add, "He will continue negotiating until he regains his health, when he will set sail for the invitation in response to the London he received from" or "He will receive Ramsay MacDonald from the independence of the agreement" and "He will return with Egypt for independence." They had begun to discuss the anticipated negotiations, larding their comment with whatever jests they saw fit.<br><br>Vast as his world of friends was, it really boiled down to three: Muhammad Iffat, Ali Abd al-Rahim, and Ibahim al-Far. Cold he imagine the world's existence without them? The way their faces lit up with genuine joy when they saw him made him happier than anything else could. His dreamy eyes met Amina's inquisitive ones. As though to remind her of something extremely important, he said, "Tomorrow."<br><br>With a beaming face she replied, "How could I forget?"<br><br>He did not attempt to conceal his pride when he commented, "It's said that the baccalaureate results were awful this year."<br><br>She smiled once more to share in his pride and said, "May our Lord make his efforts successful and let us live long enough to see him obtain his degree."<br><br>"Did you go to Sugar Street today?" he asked.<br><br>"Yes," she replied, "and I invited everyone. They'll all come except the old lady, who excused herself because she's so tired. Her two sons will congratulate Kamal on her behalf."<br><br>Gesturing toward his cloak with his chin, al-Sayyid Ahmad said, "Today Shaykh Mutawalli Abd al-Samad brought me amulets for the children of Khadija and Aisha. His wish for me was: 'God willing, I'll make you amulets for your grandchildren's children.'"<br><br>Shaking his head, he smiled and continued, "Nothing's impossible for God. Shaykh Mutawalli himself is like iron even though he's in his eighties."<br><br>"May our Lord grant you health and strength."<br><br>He reflected for a time while he counted on his fingers. Then he observed, "If my father had lived, may God be compassionate to him, he would not have been much older than the shaykh." <br><br>"May God have mercy on all those who have departed this life."<br><br>Silence reigned until the impact of the reference to the dead had dissipated. As though remembering something important, the man said, "Zaynab's gotten engaged!"<br><br>Amina's eyes grew wide. She raised her head and asked, "Really?"<br><br>"Yes, Muhammad Iffat told me tonight."<br><br>"Who is it?"<br><br>"A civil servant named Muhammad Hasan, who is head of the records office in the Ministry of Education."<br><br>She commented despondently, "It sounds as though he's advanced in years."<br><br>"Not at all," he objected. "He's in his thirties, thirty-five, thirty-six, forty at the most." He continued sarcastically, "She tried her luck with young men and failed. I mean young men with no backbone. Let her try her luck with mature men."<br><br>Amina said sorrowfully, "Yasin would have been better for her, if only because of their son."<br><br>Al-Sayyid Ahmad shared her opinion, which he had defended for a long ti...</p><h2>Cold Comfort Farm</h2><p>Flora Poste, orphaned at twenty, decides to go and live with her relatives at Cold Comfort Farm. Once there she discovers they exist in a state of chaos and feels it is up to her to bring order. From the author of LIGHT AND EASY.</p><p>Stella Gibbons was born in London in 1902. She went to North London Collegiate School and studied journalism at University College, London. She then worked for ten years on various papers, including the Evening Standard. Her first publication was a book of poems, The Mountain Beast (1930), and her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932), won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize. Amongst her other novels are Miss Linsey and Pa (1936), Nightingale Wood (1938), Westwood (1946), Conference at Cold Comfort Farm (1949) and Beside the Pearly Water (1954). Stella Gibbons died in 1989.Narrator Anna Massey has her work cut out for her as she takes on the eccentric Starr family of Cold Comfort Farm. Massey conveys humor and even a touch of suspense. The sights, sounds, even the smells of the farm are evoked amid the minutia of Gibbons&#39;s details. The very sounds of the words have as much effect as the tale they tell. Gibbons&#39;s use of melodrama popular in the early 1900&#39;s, to tell a romantic tale while simultaneously satirizing the genre, makes Massey&#39;s job more challenging. She manages quite well. The resurrection of the farm from brooding ineffectuality to normal human activity is worth listening to over and over. D.P.D.

I hope you forgive me when you learn that I have held it back in order to share good news. Yesterday your sister Hannah was delivered of a healthy son. Both mother and child are in good health and spirits.<br><br>Your nephews Henry and John are beside themselves with joy, but the girls were disappointed. When Ben brought them in to see Hannah and meet their new brother, Amelie patted her mother on the shoulder in a consoling manner. Eliza told her to never mind, the next one was sure to be a girl.<br><br>It was all Curiosity and I could do not to laugh aloud.<br><br>It is my impression that Hannah is finished with childbearing. She said to me not so long ago that five healthy children are more than enough, though she believes Ben would cheerfully continue until they were overrun like the old woman who lived in a shoe.<br><br>You are wondering what name they have given to this newest Savard, but I have promised Birdie that she could be the one to tell.<br><br>There is quite a bit of news that will interest you. Now that Blue-Jay is remarried and settled at Lake in the Clouds we were all hoping for a peaceful autumn, but Gabriel has declared his intention to marry Annie straight away.<br><br>I must admit that I am concerned. Annie was to go to Albany to study at Mrs. Burrough&#x2019;s School next month. It is my sincere belief that she deserves that opportunity, but it must be her decision. My concern right now is making it clear to Gabriel that he must be guided by her in this. And they are so very young.<br><br>Daniel is in good health and seems to have less difficulty with his arm of late, but then it is hard to know exactly. You know your twin, and will not be surprised to hear that he cloaks his feelings much of the time, and we see less of him than we would like. If it were not for his responsibilities as a teacher I suspect he would follow Robbie MacLachlan&#x2019;s example and be content to live alone, far from any settlement. But he is the teacher, and a good one. Birdie finds him very strict in the classroom, but she does not claim that he is unfair.<br><br>In the village we Bonners continue as the main topic of conversation. Blue-Jay&#x2019;s marriage and now the promise of Gabriel&#x2019;s is of unending interest. Missy Parker&#x2014;pardon me, I mean Missy O&#x2019;Brien as of this winter past. I said the other day that I can never remember that she married Baldy O&#x2019;Brien, and Curiosity laughed, and said that Missy must want to forget that herself.<br><br>So Missy came into the trading post while I was looking at fabric, and she told Mrs. Mayfair that the Bonners were reaping their reward for keeping such close quarters with Indians. Gabriel would be giving Mrs. Elizabeth Middleton Bonner red-skinned grandchildren and just how would she like that? Then she turned around and saw me standing there and she hopped in place, like a very plump rabbit.<br><br>I plan to have a discussion with Mrs. O&#x2019;Brien. It is unacceptable for her to speak so, when any one of Hannah&#x2019;s children&#x2014;my grandchildren&#x2014;might be close enough to hear.<br><br>Other friends are mostly well. Martha is still in Manhattan and it seems unlikely that she will ever come back here to stay. Apparently there is now a young man who calls on her. Young Callie has had more than her share of trouble. This past season she lost almost her whole crop, for the second year in a row. The season was wet, and apples are prone to rot. With Levi&#x2019;s help she presses just enough applejack to survive from one harvest to the next.<br><br>Now I will pass this letter over to Birdie. Your father and I, your sisters and brothers, we all send you and Simon our love and affection.<br><br>Your mother Elizabeth Middleton Bonner<br><br>Dear sister and good brother:<br><br>Hannah and Ben have named their new son Simon. Is that not good news? Now that we have a young Simon, you must come home so old Simon can see his namesake. It would be the polite thing to do, and you know how much Ma likes it when we do the polite thing.<br><br>Some things that Ma should have writ: When I complained that if Gabriel got married and moved out of the house I&#x2019;d be alone, our fine brother said that is what comes of being an After-Thought and Da said, I would call Birdie our Best Idea. So you see, if you and Simon were to come home that would be a great comfort to me.<br><br>I have finished my nine-patch quilt. I am sure I had to pick out every seam at least three times. If I never hold a needle again it will be far too soon, but Curiosity was talking about buttonholes just yesterday and giving me a look I did not like at all. I have come to think of it as her Woe-unto-thee-Birdie look. Last week Daniel showed me how to balance a knife on the palm and how to grip it properly, the first steps toward accurate throwing.<br><br>I have very little room, but Curiosity wants me to tell you that she tried her hand at that paste receipt you sent, but she fears she got it wrong. It took a prodigious amount of butter to get it down her gullet.<br><br>Your loving little sister<br><br>Curiosity-called-Birdie<br>30 September 1823<br><br>Dear Ma and Da, dear Everyone,<br><br>I write under separate cover to congratulate my sister Hannah and her Ben on the birth of a healthy son. Simon was very honored to learn that he now has a namesake.<br><br>We are just back from a long walk in gardens at the Villa Borghese, and now I sit down to share with you the decision we have reached after many days of discussion. Simon paces the room while I write and so I will take pity on him and put down our news in plain words, as my father and mother will approve.<br><br>It is time for us to come home. It is six years this month since we left on our travels. I have done what I set out to do and more, and we are both homesick. Your coordinated siege by post has brought me to surrender, although I will miss Birdie&#x2019;s letters especially.<br><br>To be very clear, I cannot promise that we will settle in Paradise permanently. Some part of this decision will depend on Luke&#x2019;s interests in Canada and what role Simon may play there. I can say that we have every intention of spending at least a full year with you, and we hope much longer.<br><br>We have had a letter from Ethan with the news that there is a new house in the village near his own, one that he would like us to have for as long as we require. This means we will not have to turn Mr. and Mrs. Lefroy out from our place, something we are loath to do. And so all the pieces have come together. We plan to sail as soon as we can sell this house and settle other business matters. If all goes well we will be home before the spring thaw. Then we can sit together by the kitchen fire and tell our stories to each other. Now that the decision is made I wish I could grow wings and fly to you.<br><br>When we have booked passage I will write again with the particulars. With all our love and affection we remain your good-son &amp; devoted daughter<br><br>Simon and Lily Ballentyne</p><h2>Lift-the-Flap Engineering</h2><p>Engineering helps shape the world around us, from the houses and cities we live in, to the way we travel, and even the sound of the music we listen to.

Our hero (instantly recognizable to most Seuss fans as the boy who captured Thing One and Thing Two in <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>) takes his young friend, Conrad Cornelius O'Donald O'Dell, on a guided tour of all the weird creatures that begin with letters such as <i>Yuzz</i>, <i>Wumbus</i>, and <i>Glikk</i>. "And Nuh is the letter I use to spell Nutches, Who live in small caves, known as Nitches, for hutches." The message is pretty simple: the alphabet pins down boring old "reality," but if you explore further afield there are more interesting worlds to discover. "So, on beyond Z! It's high time you were shown, / That you really don't know all there is to be known." Explorers in need of guidance will even find a table of useful new letters (a <i>beyondabet</i>? a <i>WumbaGlikk</i>?) in the back. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>lor. "Children will be intrigued and delighted with the nonsensical alphabet that begins after Z."--<i>Booklist.</i></p><h2>The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories</h2><p><p> Between 1650 and 1750, four Catholic churches were the best solar observatories in the world. Built to fix an unquestionable date for Easter, they also housed instruments that threw light on the disputed geometry of the solar system, and so, within sight of the altar, subverted Church doctrine about the order of the universe. </p><p> A tale of politically canny astronomers and cardinals with a taste for mathematics, <i>The Sun in the Church</i> tells how these observatories came to be, how they worked, and what they accomplished. It describes Galileo's political overreaching, his subsequent trial for heresy, and his slow and steady rehabilitation in the eyes of the Catholic Church. And it offers an enlightening perspective on astronomy, Church history, and religious architecture, as well as an analysis of measurements testing the limits of attainable accuracy, undertaken with rudimentary means and extraordinary zeal. Above all, the book illuminates the niches protected and financed by the Catholic Church in which science and mathematics thrived. </p><p> Superbly written, <i>The Sun in the Church</i> provides a magnificent corrective to long-standing oversimplified accounts of the hostility between science and religion. </p></p><p><i>The Sun in the Church</i> by J.L. Heilbron is a provocative work of scholarship that challenges long-held views of the relationship between science and Christianity. Heilbron's main point is simple enough: "The Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy for over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment, than any other, and, probably, all other, institutions." Despite the persecution of Galileo, Heilbron notes, the Church actively supported mathematical and astronomical research--often designing cathedrals that could also function as observatories--in order to set the precise date of Easter (a crucial endeavor for maintaining the unity of the Church). Heilbron's fluid, engaging style brings his detailed reconstructions of 16th- and 17th-century Church politics to life. And his argument that scientific knowledge was deemed both morally neutral and politically useful during the Reformation and beyond yields an unusually interesting, complex, and human understanding of Catholicism in the early Modern period. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>A fascinating history of astronomy that shows, as no other work has done so well, what happened to Italian science after Galileo&#39;s trial. An astonishing display of erudition and linguistic control, with a wealth of fine details, this is a major history that carves out a unique territory. (Owen Gingerich, Harvard University)</p><h2>Writings from the New Yorker: 1925-1976</h2><p>New Hardcover with dust jacket</p><p>Three years after E. B. White's death, Rebecca Dale discovered a cache of his <i>New Yorker</i> writings that had yet to be collected. There's certainly nothing mediocre about these 161 pieces, which range from nature vignettes (a New York City sparrow extols urban life) to musings on language, business, and liberty. White's 1953 fantasia of visiting Thoreau's Walden Pond with Joseph McCarthy is peerless. "Wait a minute!" the senator realizes. "This man was Communist-inspired. That accounts for his sour attitude about housing--" The satire is strong, but so is the celebration. A short piece on a skating fest ends: "Ice is an odd substance to have at last freed the body in its persistent attempt to catch up with the spirit." And speaking of which, in "Fred On Space" White asks his dead dachshund how he feels about the first dog launched by the Russians. Fred is far from impressed: "The excuse you men give is that you must continually add to the store of human knowledge--a store that already resembles a supermarket and is beginning to hypnotize the customers."<p>E. B. White, the author of such beloved classics as <em>Charlotte's Web</em>, <em>Stuart Little</em>, and <em>The Trumpet of the Swan</em>, was born in Mount Vernon, New York. He graduated from Cornell University in 1921 and, five or six years later, joined the staff of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine, then in its infancy. He died on October 1, 1985, and was survived by his son and three grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. White's essays have appeared in <em>Harper's</em> magazine, and some of his other books are: <em>One Man's Meat</em>, <em>The Second Tree from the Corner</em>, <em>Letters of E. B. White</em>, <em>Essays of E. B. White</em>, and <em>Poems and Sketches of E. B. White</em>. He won countless awards, including the 1971 National Medal for Literature and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, which commended him for making a "substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children."</p><p>During his lifetime, many young readers asked Mr. White if his stories were true. In a letter written to be sent to his fans, he answered, "No, they are imaginary tales . . . But real life is only one kind of life&#x2014;there is also the life of the imagination."</p></p><h2>Song of Achilles</h2><p>Brand new copy.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: Betrayal, ardor, war, and prophecies--in <i>The Song of Achilles</i>, author Madeline Miller brings together everything I love about <i>The Iliad</i> without the labor of epic poetry. In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair. <i>The Song of Achilles</i> infuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next. <i>--Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <strong> Gregory Maguire Interviews Madeline Miller</strong><br> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire is the best-selling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>, <em>Lost, </em><em>Mirror Mirror, </em> the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and most recently, <em>Out of Oz</em>. </strong></p> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire:</strong> Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia, <em>The Iliad</em> has garnered somewhat wider attention than <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?</p> <p><strong> Madeline Miller:</strong> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&#x2014;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&#x2019;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.</p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.</p> <p>As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&#x2014;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself. He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.</p> <p><strong>Maguire:</strong> Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.</p> <p>It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&#x2014;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.</p> <p></p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> Oscar Wilde said something like, &#x201c;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&#x201d; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question. It is a salute.</p><p>The legend begins...</p><p><em>Greece in the age of heroes.</em> Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. &#x201c;The best of all the Greeks&#x201d;&#x2014;strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess&#x2014;Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine&#x2014;much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles&#x2019; mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.</p><p>When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p><p>Built on the groundwork of the <em>Iliad</em>, Madeline Miller&#x2019;s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career. </p></p><h2>Confessions (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>In his own day the dominant personality of the Western Church, Augustine of Hippo today stands as perhaps the greatest thinker of Christian antiquity, and his <em>Confessions</em> is one of the great works of Western literature. In this intensely personal narrative, Augustine relates his rare ascent from a humble Algerian farm to the edge of the corridors of power at the imperial court in Milan, his struggle against the domination of his sexual nature, his renunciation of secular ambition and marriage, and the recovery of the faith his mother Monica had taught him during his childhood.<br> Now, Henry Chadwick, an eminent scholar of early Christianity, has given us the first new English translation in thirty years of this classic spiritual journey. Chadwick renders the details of Augustine's conversion in clear, modern English. We witness the future saint's fascination with astrology and with the Manichees, and then follow him through scepticism and disillusion with pagan myths until he finally reaches Christian faith. There are brilliant philosophical musings about Platonism and the nature of God, and touching portraits of Augustine's beloved mother, of St. Ambrose of Milan, and of other early Christians like Victorinus, who gave up a distinguished career as a rhetorician to adopt the orthodox faith. Augustine's concerns are often strikingly contemporary, yet his work contains many references and allusions that are easily understood only with background information about the ancient social and intellectual setting. To make <em>The Confessions</em> accessible to contemporary readers, Chadwick provides the most complete and informative notes of any recent translation, and includes an introduction to establish the context.<br> The religious and philosophical value of <em>The Confessions</em> is unquestionable--now modern readers will have easier access to St. Augustine's deeply personal meditations. Chadwick's lucid translation and helpful introduction clear the way for a new experience of this classic.</p><p><br><em>About the Translator:</em><br> An expert on the early Church, <strong>Henry Chadwick</strong> is Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br>Cheryl's relatively small backyard was festooned with streamers and balloons and crowded with yelling kids. Portable tables sagged under custom-made cakes and piles of brightly wrapped presents, while two clowns and a slightly ratty Cinderella mingled with miniature guests, all of them sugar-jazzed. Austin's childhood pony, Bamboozle, trucked in from the Silver Spur especially for the birthday party, provided rides with saintlike equanimity.<br><br>Keeping one eye on the horse and the other on his daughters, six years old as of 7:52 that sunny June morning, Tate counted himself a lucky man, for all the rocky roads he'd traveled. Born almost two months before full term, the babies had weighed less than six pounds put together, and their survival had been by no means a sure thing. Although the twins were fraternal, they looked so much alike that strangers usually thought they were identical. Both had the striking blue eyes that ran in the McKettrick bloodline, and their long glossy hair was nearly black, like Cheryl's and his own. His girls were healthy now, thank God, but Tate still worried plenty about them, on general principle. They seemed so fragile to him, too thin, with their long, skinny legs, and Ava wore glasses and a hearing aid that was all but invisible.<br><br>Cheryl startled Tate out of his reflections by jabbing him in the ribs with a clipboard. Today, her waist-length hair was wound into a braided knot at the back of her neck. "Sign this," she ordered, sotto voce.<br><br>Tate had promised himself he'd be civil to his ex-wife, for the twins' sake. Looking down into Cheryl's green eyes&#x2014;she'd been a beauty queen in her day&#x2014;he wondered what he'd been drinking the night they met.<br><br>Gorgeous as Cheryl was, she flat-out wasn't his type, and she never had been.<br><br>He glanced at the paper affixed to the clipboard and frowned, then gave all the legalese a second look. It was basically a permission slip, allowing Audrey and Ava to participate in something called the Pixie Pageant, to be held around the time school started, out at the Blue River Country Club. Under the terms of their custody agreement, Cheryl needed his approval for any extracurricular activity the children took part in. It had cost him plenty to get her to sign off on that one.<br><br>"No," he said succinctly, tucking the clipboard under one arm, since Cheryl didn't look like she intended to take it back.<br><br>The former Mrs. McKettrick, once again using her maiden name, Darbrey, rolled her eyes, patted her sleek and elegant hair. "Oh, for God's sake," she complained, though he had to give her points for keeping her voice down. "It's just a harmless little pageant, to raise money for the new tennis court at the community center&#x2014;"<br><br>Tate's mind flashed on the disturbing film clips he'd seen of kids dolled up in false eyelashes, blusher and lipstick, like Las Vegas showgirls, prancing around some stage. He leaned in, matching his tone to hers. "They're <em>six, </em>Cheryl," he reminded her. "Let them be little girls while they can."<br><br>His former wife folded her tanned, gym-toned arms. She looked good in her expensive daffodil-yellow sundress, but the mean glint in her eyes spoiled the effect. " <em>I </em>was in pageants from the time I was five," she pointed out tersely, "and I turned out okay." Realizing too late that she'd opened an emotional pothole and then stepped right into it, she made a slight huffing sound.<br><br>"Debatable," Tate drawled, plastering a smile onto his mouth because some of the moms and nannies were looking in their direction, and they'd stirred up enough gossip as it was.<br><br>Cheryl flushed, toyed with one tasteful gold earring. "Bastard," she whispered, peevish. "Why do you have to be so damn pigheaded about things like this?"<br><br>He laughed. Hooked his thumbs through the belt loops of his jeans. Dug in his heels a little&#x2014;both literally and figuratively. "If other people want to let their kids play Miss This-That-and-the-Other-Thing, that's their business. It's probably harmless fun, but <em>mine </em>aren't going to&#x2014;not before they're old enough to make the choice on their own, anyhow. By that time, I hope Audrey and Ava will have more in their heads than makeup tips and the cosmetic uses of duct tape."<br><br>Eyes flashing, Cheryl looked as though she wanted to put out both hands and shove him backward into the koi pond&#x2014; or jerk the clipboard from under his arm and bash him over the head with it. She did neither of those things&#x2014;she didn't want a scene any more than he did, though her reasons were different. Tate cared about one thing and one thing only: that his daughters had a good time at their birthday party. Cheryl, on the other hand, knew a public dustup would make the rounds of the country club and the Junior League before sundown.<br><br>She had her image to consider.<br><br>Tate, by contrast, didn't give a rat's ass what anybody thought&#x2014;except for his daughters, that is, and a few close friends.<br><br>So they glared at each other, he and this woman he'd married years ago, squaring off like two gunfighters on a dusty street. And then Ava slipped between them.<br><br>"Don't fight, okay?" she pleaded anxiously, the hot Texas sunlight glinting on the smudged lenses of her glasses. "It's our <em>birthday, </em>remember?"<br><br>Tate felt his neck pulse with the singular heat of shame. So much for keeping the ongoing hostilities between Mommy and Daddy under wraps.<br><br>Cheryl smiled wickedly and rested a manicured hand on Ava's shoulder, left all but bare by the spaghetti strap holding up her dress&#x2014;a miniature version of her mother's outfit. Audrey's getup was the same, except blue.<br><br>"Your daddy," Cheryl told the child sweetly, "doesn't want you and Audrey to compete in the Pixie Pageant. I was trying to change his mind."<br><br><em>Good luck with that, </em>Tate thought, forcibly relaxing the muscles in his jaws. He tried for a smile, for Ava's sake, but the effort was a bust.<br><br>"That stuff is dumb anyway," Ava said.<br><br>Audrey appeared on the scene, as though magnetized by an opinion at variance with her own. "No, it <em>isn't," </em>she protested, with her customary spirit. "Pageants are good for building self-confidence and making friends, and if you win, you get a banner and a trophy <em>and </em>a tiara."<br><br>"I see you've been coaching them to take the party line," Tate told Cheryl.<br><br>Cheryl's smile was dazzling. He'd spent a fortune on those pearly whites of hers. Through them, she said, "Shut up, Tate."<br><br>Ava, always sensitive to the changing moods of the parental unit, started to cry, making a soft, sniffly sound that tore at Tate's heart. "We're only going to be six <em>once" </em>she said. "And everybody's looking!"<br><br>"Thank heaven we're only going to be six once," Audrey interjected sagely, folding her arms Cheryl-style. "I'd rather be forty."<br><br>Tate bent his knees, scooped up Ava in the crook of one arm and tugged lightly at Audrey's long braid with his free hand. Ava buried her face in his shoulder, bumping her glasses askew. He felt tears and mucus moisten the fabric of his pale blue shirt.<br><br>"Forty?" she said, voice muffled. "Even <em>Daddy </em>isn't that old!"<br><br>"You're such a baby," Audrey replied.<br><br>"Enough," Tate told both children, but he was looking at Cheryl as he spoke. "When is this shindig supposed to be over?"<br><br>They'd opened presents, devoured everything but the cakes and competed for prizes a person would expect to see on a TV game show. What else was there to do?<br><br>"Why can't you just stop fighting?" Ava blurted.<br><br>"We're <em>not </em>fighting, darling," Cheryl pointed out quietly, before turning to sweep her watchful friends and the nannies up in a benign smile. "And stop carrying on, Ava. It isn't becoming&#x2014;or ladylike."<br><br>"Can we go out to the ranch, Daddy?" Ava asked him plaintively, ignoring her mother's comment. "I like it better there, because nobody fights."<br><br>"Me, too," Tate agreed. It was his turn to take the kids, and he'd been looking forward to it since their last visit. Giving them back was always a wrench.<br><br>"Nobody fights at the ranch?" Audrey argued, sounding way too bored and way too sophisticated for a six-year-old. Yeah, she was a prime candidate for the Pixie Pageant, all right, Tate thought bitterly&#x2014;bring on the mascara and enough hairspray to rip a new hole in the ozone layer, and don't forget the feather boas and the fishnet stockings.<br><br>Audrey drew a breath and went right on talking. "I guess you don't remember the day Uncle Austin came home from the hospital after that bull hurt him so bad, before he started rehab in Dallas, and how he told Daddy and Uncle Garrett to stay out of his part of the house unless they wanted a belly full of buckshot."<br><br>Cheryl arched one eyebrow, triumphant. For all their land, cattle, oil shares and cold, hard cash, the McKettricks were just a bunch of Texas rednecks, as far as she was concerned. She'd grown up in a Park Avenue high-rise, a cherished only child, after all, her mother an heiress to a legendary but rapidly dwindling fortune, her father a famous novelist, of the literary variety.<br><br>But, please, nobody mention that dear old Mom snorted coke and would sleep with anything in pants, and Dad ran through the last of his wife's money and then his surprisingly modest earnings as the new Ernest Hemingway.<br><br>Cheryl had never gotten over the humiliation of having to wait tables and take out student loans to put herself through college and law school.<br><br>"I wonder what my attorney would say," Cheryl intoned, "if I told him the children are exposed to <em>guns, </em>out there on the wild and wooly Silver Spur."<br><br>While Tate couldn't argue that there weren't firearms on the ranch&#x2014;between the snakes and all the other dangers inherent to the land, firepower might well prove to be a necessity at any time&#x2014;it was a stretch to say the girls were "exposed" to them. Every weapon was locked up in one of several safes, and the combinations changed regularly.<br><br>"I wonder what <em>mine </em>would say," Tate retorted evenly, the fake smile aching on his face, "if he knew about your plans for this week."<br><br>"Stop," Ava begged.<br><br>Tate sighed, kissed his daughter smartly on the forehead, and set her on her feet again. "Sorry, sweetheart," he said. "Say goodbye and thanks to your friends. The party's over."<br><br>"They haven't even sung the song I taught them," Cheryl said.<br><br>Ava leaned against Tate's hip. "We're not good singers at all," she confided.<br><br>Somewhat to Tate's surprise, it was Audrey, the performer in the family, who turned on one sandaled heel, faced the assemblage and announced cheerfully, "You can all go home now&#x2014;my dad says the party's over."<br><br>Cheryl winced.<br><br>The kids&#x2014;and the pony&#x2014;seemed relieved. So did the nannies, though the proper term, according to Cheryl, was <em>au pairs. </em>The mothers, many of whom Tate had known since kindergarten and dated in high school between all-too-frequent breakups with Libby Remington, the great love of his youth, if not his entire life, hid bitchy little smiles with varying degrees of success.<br><br>"The girls are a little tired," Cheryl explained, with convincing sincerity. "All this excitement&#x2014;"<br><br>"Can we ride horses when we get to the ranch?" Audrey called, from halfway across the yard. "Can we swim in the pool?"<br><br>Tate made damn sure he didn't smile at this indication of how "tired" his daughters were, but it was hard.<br><br>Ava remained at his side, both arms clenched around his waist now.<br><br>"Their suitcases," Cheryl said tightly, "are in the hall."<br><br>"Let's load Bamboozle in the trailer," Tate told Ava, gently easing out of her embrace. "Then we'll get your stuff and head for the ranch."<br><br>Ava peeled herself away from Tate, walked over and took Bamboozle by the bridle strap, patiently waiting to lead the elderly animal to the trailer hitched to the back of Tate's truck. Audrey had disappeared into the house, on some mission all her own.<br><br>"Don't help," Cheryl snapped, out of one side of her mouth. "You've already done enough, Tate McKettrick."<br><br>"I live to delight you in every possible way, Cheryl."<br><br>Audrey poked her head out between the French doors standing a little ajar between the living room and the patio. "Can we stop at the Perk Up on the way out of town, Dad?" she wanted to know, as calmly as if the backyard weren't full of dismissed guests. "Get some of those orange smoothie things, like before?"<br><br>Tate grinned. "Sure," he told his daughter, even though the thought of stopping at Libby's coffee shop made the pit of his stomach tighten. He'd only gone in there the last time because he'd known Libby was out of town, and her sister, Julie, was running the show.<br><br>Which was ridiculous. They'd managed to avoid each other for years now, no mean trick in such a small town, but it was getting to be too damn much work.<br><br>"Just what they need&#x2014;more sugar," Cheryl muttered, shaking her head as she walked away, her arms still crossed in front of her chest, only more tightly now.<br><br>Tate held his tongue. <em>He </em>hadn't been the one to serve cake and ice cream and fruit punch by the wheelbarrow load all afternoon.<br><br>Cheryl kept walking.<br><br>Tate and Ava led the pony into the horse trailer, which, along with his truck, took up at least three parking spaces on the shady street in front of Cheryl's house. He'd bought the place for her as a part&#x2014;a <em>small </em>part&#x2014;of their divorce settlement.<br><br>"Boozle might get lonely riding in this big trailer all by himself," Ava fretted, standing beside the pony while he slurped up water from a bucket. "Maybe I should ride back here with him, so he'd have some company."<br><br>"Not a chance," Tate said affably, dumping a flake of hay into the feeder for the pony to munch on, going home. "Too dangerous."<br><br>Ava adjusted her glasses. "Audrey really wants to be in that Pixie Pageant," she said, her voice small. "She's going to nag you three ways from Sunday about it, too."<br><br>Tate bit back a grin. "I think I can handle a little nagging," he said lightly. "Let's go get your stuff and hit the road, Shortstop."<br><br>"I probably wouldn't win anyway," Ava mused wistfully, stopping her father cold.<br><br>"Win what?" Tate asked.<br><br>Ava giggled, but it was a strained sound, like she was forcing it. "The <em>Pixie Pageant, </em>Dad. Keep up, will you?"<br><br>Tate's throat went tight, but he managed a chuckle. "Sure, you'd win," he said. "And that's another reason I won't let you enter in the first place. Just think how bad all those other little girls would feel."<br><br>"Audrey could be Miss Pixie," Ava speculated thoughtfully, a small, light-rimmed shadow standing there in the horse trailer. "She can twirl a baton and everything. I keep on dropping mine."<br><br>"Audrey isn't entering," Tate said. Bamboozle was between them; he removed the pony's saddle and blanket, ran a hand along his sweaty back. "She'lljusthave to content herself with being Miss <em>McKettrick, </em>at least for the foreseeable future."<br><br>Ava mulled that over for a few moments, chewing her lower lip. "Do you think I'll be pretty when I grow up, Dad?"<br><br></p><h2>Christmas With Rosamunde Pilcher</h2><p>Rosamunde Pilcher, the beloved author of <i>The Shell Seekers</i> and <i>Coming Home</i>, invites you to share the magic of the Christmas season with her and her family as they celebrate the holiday in timeless Scottish tradition.

Today, a hundred years after his birth, his influence is almost as powerful as it was in the mid 20th century, when he was working on many of Britain's finest and most famous houses, including Uppark, Chequers and Buckingham Palace, as well as dozens of more modest projects. Fowler's style has been so widely imitated that it is easy to forget what an innovator he was. In the 1930s and 1940s his style was a breath of fresh country air, sweeping away heavy velvets and damasks in favour of crisp cotton chintzes, replacing glossy mahogany with painted Regency furnishings, elaborate porcelain and glitzy ormolu with modest pottery and painted tin. Even after the war, when he came to specialize in the decoration of architecturally important interiors, he continued to prefer 'humble elegance' and 'romantic disrepair' to pomposity.</p><p>Martin Wood is an established textile and interior designer.

Washington feared the country would fall to communism, triggering a domino effect in the rest of Southeast Asia. So in January 1961, Eisenhower approved the CIA&#x2019;s Operation Momentum, a plan to create a proxy army of ethnic Hmong to fight communist forces in Laos. While remaining largely hidden from the American public and most of Congress, Momentum became the largest CIA paramilitary operation in the history of the United States. The brutal war, which continued under Presidents Kennedy and Nixon, lasted nearly two decades, killed one-tenth of Laos&#x2019;s total population, left thousands of unexploded bombs in the ground, and changed the nature of the CIA forever.<br> <br>Joshua Kurlantzick gives us the definitive account of the Laos war and its central characters, including the four key people who led the operation&#x2014;the CIA operative who came up with the idea, the Hmong general who led the proxy army in the field, the paramilitary specialist who trained the Hmong, and the State Department careerist who took control over the war as it grew.<br> <br>The Laos war created a CIA that fights with real soldiers and weapons as much as it gathers secrets. Laos became a template for CIA proxy wars all over the world, from Central America in the 1980s to today&#x2019;s war on terrorism, where the CIA has taken control with little oversight. Based on extensive interviews and CIA records only recently declassified, <i>A Great Place to Have a War</i> is a riveting, thought-provoking look at how Operation Momentum changed American foreign policy forever.</p><p>Joshua Kurlantzick is a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Smoke wafted through the one-room building with mud floors and walls made of corrugated metal and thatch. Besides an open stove in the back of the room and a simple wood table in the middle, there was little other furniture in the building. Lair had been given a low wooden bench to sit on, and he struggled to fold his legs under it. Most of the other people inside the building stood or squatted on the muddy ground.<br> <br>Lair was surrounded by men and women from the Hmong hill tribe, one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the Southeast Asian nation of Laos, the landlocked country wedged, like a fishhook, among Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. They had come for the baci, the Thai and Laotian ceremony in which people are symbolically bound through the tying of strings around each other&#x2019;s wrists and forearms. The ceremony had been going on since the late afternoon, and Lair already had at least twenty white strings tied around his arms. His arms would be covered in strings by night. There seemed to be no end to the mass of people crowding through the door of the house and waiting to see the American with the bristly buzz cut and the thick Clark Kent glasses who spoke fluent Lao with a Texas accent. Behind the Texan, women loaded up simple metal plates with pig parts, sticky rice, and fruit, and handed them to Lair, nodding at him to eat. The Hmong women mostly waited to eat until men were finished. Three shamans chanted just behind Lair. Many Hmong believed that when they chanted, the shamans literally entered another world. The men writhed and sang and spat as if possessed.<br> <br>Vang Pao, a military officer in the anti-communist forces and the leader of this group of Hmong, paced among Lair, the doorway, and the shamans, directing the event. Lair could not see all the people outside the hut, but he estimated that at least five hundred Hmong had come to the baci. Vang Pao&#x2019;s battlefield successes had helped him ascend from a modest background&#x2014;his family had not been clan leaders&#x2014;to become one of the most powerful Hmong men on the anti-communist side. He would soon be the most powerful Hmong leader in Laos.1<br> <br>Vang Pao claimed to be leading an army of nearly five thousand irregulars against the Vietnamese and Laotian communists. But Lair saw not only young men who might be fighting types but also younger women, children, and older Hmong. Some of the older Hmong men and women had come to the baci dressed in what Lair believed was their finest attire: baggy black trousers, embroidered black vests, and strings of silver ornaments.<br> <br>It was the winter of 1961. Lair had already lived in Southeast Asia for more than a decade, and he had attended baci ceremonies before. Groups throughout Southeast Asia had bacis all the time. Bacis were held, and strings tied, when new homes were built, when relatives relocated, when babies were born, when men and women were married off, when visitors arrived from far away. A village of Hmong might hold fifteen or twenty baci ceremonies in one month, if many auspicious events occurred at one time.<br> <br>But this was not a normal baci. Bill Lair had spent his decade in Southeast Asia as a clandestine operative for the Central Intelligence Agency, and he had become known within the agency for his knowledge of the region, his language skills, and his extensive contacts. Behind his shy, aw-shucks demeanor, his plain shirts and plain face, lurked a fierce man who had fought through France and Belgium with an armored division in the Second World War and had devoted his whole life to the CIA. Lair had flown up to the central highlands of Laos, where the Hmong lived on peaks and high mountain plateaus, not just to have strings tied around his wrists&#x2014;though he understood that ceremony mattered in a place where there was no written language, and oral agreements were the rule. He had flown up, his pilot twisting around high peaks and limestone cliffs and dense forests, to inaugurate a bold plan that the agency would call Operation Momentum.2<br> <br>Operation Momentum was a plan to arm and train the Hmong under Vang Pao to fight in the growing civil war in Laos, which pitted communist insurgents called the Pathet Lao, backed by North Vietnam, against Laos&#x2019;s government and its non-communist allies such as Vang Pao and his men. The war in Laos had raged on and off almost from the time Japan surrendered in World War II in 1945, leaving in Southeast Asia former French colonies where local leaders battled to determine the future. France&#x2019;s loss to the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese independence forces, in 1954 had left Vietnam divided, with the Viet Minh&#x2019;s leaders in control in the north, and a vacuum of power in Laos. (The Viet Minh was led by communists, but the coalition fighting France for independence also included some non-communist nationalists.) Laos&#x2019;s weak central government had maintained control of only parts of the country. The civil war in Laos, which had been going on for nearly a decade, had flared up intensely. Conservative and communist Laotian forces now struggled to control Laos, as well as other countries in the region.<br> <br>And in Washington, Laos increasingly appeared, at least to American officials, to be part of a broader effort by international communist forces to dominate Asia&#x2014;and the world. It did not seem to matter to American leaders that Laos was so small it had only one major city, Vientiane&#x2014;the capital, which was basically a muddy village&#x2014;or that most people in Laos lived on subsistence farming and had little idea of the differences between communism, democracy, and other political systems.<br> <br>As a French colony, Laos had mostly been ignored by Paris. But President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff, attuned to the domino theory of one country after the next falling to communism, saw Laos as a bulwark&#x2014;a nation where the United States could make a stand to prevent communism from spreading west out of China and North Vietnam into Thailand and India and beyond. A pro-Western Laos would place a state between Vietnam and Thailand, a critical US partner, and would make it easier for the United States to support non-communist forces in Vietnam. In one of the most famous moments of his presidency, at a press conference in April 1954, Eisenhower had publicly enunciated this domino principle as a reason for supporting France&#x2019;s continued struggle against independence forces in Vietnam.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly,&#x201d; Eisenhower said. &#x201c;So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences&#x201d; if Indochinese countries fell to communism.3 Even after the French loss in Indochina, the Eisenhower administration had made clear the importance of Indochina to US security; a paper issued by the National Security Council in December 1954 stated that it was the United States&#x2019; objective to &#x201c;defeat Communist subversion and influence&#x201d; in Indochina.4 Over the course of the 1950s, with Vietnam divided and half controlled by a communist party, Eisenhower had come to see Laos as another critical domino. He personally followed reports about Laos day by day during the final year of his presidency.5 He warned his successor, John F. Kennedy, that Laos was the most pressing foreign policy issue in the world. In fact, the day before Kennedy&#x2019;s inauguration, Eisenhower organized a foreign policy briefing for the president elect, with issues to be addressed in what Eisenhower considered their order of importance to American security. Laos came first&#x2014;and only after Laos was discussed was the president elect briefed on the looming US-Soviet standoff in Berlin, on Cuba, and on the global strategic nuclear arms race.6<br> <br>Agency headquarters had approved Lair&#x2019;s plan to train and arm the Hmong, which he had outlined in an eighteen-page cable, almost instantly upon receiving it in the winter of 1960&#x2013;61. The White House took a personal interest in the plan for the operation. After the CIA&#x2019;s Far East division and its director signed off on Lair&#x2019;s idea, the plan was approved by President Eisenhower&#x2019;s staff, on one of Eisenhower&#x2019;s last days in office in January 1961. It helped that Lair had already run a successful CIA training program for Thai commandos in the 1950s. Some of those Thais would join him in running Operation Momentum, and in fighting Laos&#x2019;s civil war; Bangkok would eventually send thousands of its men to fight in Laos. The CIA leadership had signed off on starting with a training program for a thousand Hmong men and then expanding from there.7 The operation was budgeted at around $5 million US, but by 1962, it would grow to over $11 million. That was only the start for an undertaking that would command $500 million annually by the end of the decade, with Vang Pao controlling a force of over thirty thousand soldiers.8 A budget of $500 million in 1970 dollars was equivalent to $3.1 billion in 2016 dollars, for an operation in a country that today has less outward trade with the rest of the world than Luxembourg does.<br> <br>Vang Pao had spent his entire adult life fighting: fighting the Japanese, fighting with the French against the Viet Minh, and now fighting with the government against the Pathet Lao and its backers in Hanoi. Like many of the Hmong, he was intensely proud of the group&#x2019;s freedom. Many Hmong had originally migrated south from China into Southeast Asia, and they traditionally migrated through the mountains, hunting and practicing swidden, or slash and burn, agriculture, and governing their affairs through a kind of communal consensus building. The group repeatedly fought any powers, including the French at first, who tried to control its society. Historian Mai Na M. Lee, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, notes that the Hmong fought for centuries&#x2014;against the Chinese, the French, and others&#x2014;to maintain their independence and try to win a state for their people. Although they never gained their own state, they forced these powers to give them a measure of autonomy.9 Like many Hmong, Vang Pao resented any outside control of the hill tribe&#x2019;s affairs and feared that a government managed by Vietnamese communists would turn Laos into a much more centralized state, starving the Hmong of their freedoms.<br> <br>Vang Pao had developed a personal animus toward the Vietnamese as well. The long French Indochina War had lasted from 1946 to 1954, as France tried desperately to hold on to its Indochinese colonies. During that war, and then during Laos&#x2019;s on-and-off civil war, Vang Pao had watched many of his friends, aides, and allies be killed by the Vietnamese and their allies. The fighting in the French Indochina War was fierce; many of the French soldiers came from the Foreign Legion, a force of professional soldiers drawn from all over the globe that was known for its willingness to take enormous casualties. The Viet Minh, meanwhile, were brutal not only toward captured enemy soldiers but also toward civilians. Fighting with the French and then with Laotian anti-communist forces, Vang Pao himself had repeatedly shot, bombed, and stabbed to death Vietnamese troops in Laos.<br> <br>The Hmong leader had organized the baci to inaugurate Momentum and introduce Lair to clan leaders in the hill tribe. He roamed the muddy house, encouraging everyone to eat and drink more, and talking, rapid-fire, in Lao, in Hmong, and in the French he had learned from French officers. Vang Pao was moving constantly&#x2014;gesturing, introducing Lair to clan leaders who had come for the baci, telling stories of the French Indochina War, commanding some of his men to find Lair more drinks. He commanded his wives&#x2014;like many powerful Hmong men, he had multiple wives&#x2014;to bring food to guests who were not eating at that minute. (Vang Pao had married women from different Hmong clans to unite several clans behind him.) As a musician played the thin Hmong bamboo mouth pipe and stomped his feet on the mud floor, Vang Pao himself tied the final string around Lair&#x2019;s wrist, binding him metaphorically to the tribe. Vang Pao led Lair toward the shamans, who waved pungent incense candles around their heads and blessed the nascent cooperation.10 Locally brewed rice alcohol flowed liberally. Vang Pao&#x2019;s men handed balls of sticky rice to Lair, to make sure that the Texan had something in his stomach to absorb all the liquor.<br> <br>Circles of Hmong men stood together, dancing the slow, hypnotic lamvong, a Laotian folk dance in which people slowly twist their wrists from side to side while swaying together to mournful, minor-key tunes that sound almost like American country and western ballads. Vang Pao laughed and drank and danced the lamvong. But during pauses, he also told other Hmong at the baci, &#x201c;We will kill all the Vietnamese who come near. Now we can kill many more.&#x201d;<br> <br>During a private meeting between Lair and Vang Pao, just before the baci, the two men had gone over the details of the operation: how the Hmong would receive arms and supplies in airdrops; how Vang Pao could help identify places to set up simple airstrips in mountain valleys; how the CIA might handle training programs for capable Hmong soldiers. But Vang Pao also made a request. Here the Hmong leader&#x2019;s account of the meeting diverges from Lair&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I asked Bill Lair to promise me that America would not abandon us [the Hmong] no matter what happened,&#x201d; Vang Pao said.11 Some Hmong sources claim further that, as the two men decided to start the operation, Lair presented Vang Pao and the Hmong with a written agreement from the American government pledging a kind of alliance, starting with a promise that the United States would soon ship the Hmong five hundred firearms.12 Several of Vang Pao&#x2019;s aides, who were at the meeting with the Hmong leader, say that Lair told them, &#x201c;If the Hmong people lose, we [the United States] will find a new place where we can help the Hmong people.&#x201d;13 American government sources do not corroborate any of these claims, and Lair did not remember making these statements.14<br> <br>Later, years after the end of the Laos war, Vang Pao would tell anyone who asked him about Laos that, no matter what was said when he agreed to the operation, no matter whether the two sides had made any written agreement, the United States had made a lasting commitment. After all, the US government, over time, would push the Hmong to broaden their battle beyond simply protecting Hmong villages and to help America&#x2019;s interests in Vietnam. That war did not involve the Hmong directly; yet Vang Pao&#x2019;s men played a major role by tying down and killing not only the small groups of Pathet Lao communists but also regular North Vietnamese troops who might otherwise have been killing Americans.15<br> <br>And the United States would unleash a bombing campaign on Laos unlike any other in modern history, bigger even than the bombings of Japan and Germany in the Second World War. This campaign would become central to the Laos operation, though the American bombing sorties, supposedly designed to weaken the North Vietnamese and cut their supply lines through Laos and into South Vietnam, would kill more Laotians than...</p><h2>The Civil War: The First Year Told by Those Who Lived It (Library of America #212)</h2><p>After 150 years the Civil War is still our greatest national drama, at once heroic, tragic, and epic-our Iliad, but also our Bible, a story of sin and judgment, suffering and despair, death and resurrection in a "new birth of freedom." Drawn from letters, diaries, speeches, articles, poems, songs, military reports, legal opinions, and memoirs, <i>The Civil War: The First Year</i> gathers over 120 pieces by more than sixty participants to create a unique firsthand narrative of this great historical crisis. Beginning on the eve of Lincoln's election in November 1860 and ending in January 1862 with the appointment of Edwin M. Stanton as secretary of war, this volume presents writing by figures well-known-Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Mary Chesnut, Frederick Douglass, and Lincoln himself among them-and less familiar, like proslavery advocate J.D.B. DeBow, Lieutenants Charles B. Haydon of the 2nd Michigan Infantry and Henry Livermore Abbott of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and plantation mistresses Catherine Edmondston of North Carolina and Kate Stone of Mississippi. Together, the selections provide a powerful sense of the immediacy, uncertainty, and urgency of events as the nation was torn asunder. Includes headnotes, a chronology of events, biographical and explanatory endnotes, full-color hand-drawn endpaper maps, and an index. Companion volumes will gather writings from the second, third, and final years of the conflict.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Three years have passed since the detonation that killed Carol's partner and lover, but she is still severely scarred both mentally and physically. She can't bear to look in the mirror, and she hasn't been with another man since David Boudreaux left her bed that last morning he went to work. She gets through the day with the help of Tagamet and alcohol.<p> When a bomb call takes the life of another colleague, Carol begins to investigate a series of explosions that seem to be designed to exterminate bomb technicians. She soon realizes that she's "the one that got away." With the help of an FBI agent whom she loathes professionally for interfering with her job but finds attractive anyway, Carol must track down one of the most frighteningly brilliant killers of the modern age. </p><p> This edgy thriller's protagonist is one that the reader at first may have difficulty liking, but she's got a background and history that make her truly three-dimensional. One hopes that Crais, one of the handful of young crime writers capable of writing consistently luminous prose, will continue to give us characters like Carol Starkey to star in his always powerful portraits of modern-day Los Angeles. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>"Robert Crais...should be mentioned in the same breath as Robert B.

The series continued with <i>Gust Front</i>, <i>When the Devil Dances</i>, <i>Hell&#x2019;s Faire</i> and <i>Eye of the Storm</i>. In addition, Ringo has penned the Council War series: <i>There Will be Dragons</i>, <i>Emerald</i><i> Sea</i>, <i>Against the Tide</i>, and <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</i>. Adding another dimension to his skills, Ringo created nationally best-selling techno-thriller novels about Mike Harmon (<i>Ghost</i>, <i>Kildar</i>, <i>Choosers of the Slain</i>, <i>Unto the Breach</i>, and <i>A Deeper Blue</i>). His latest techno-thriller, <i>The Last Centurion</i>,<i> </i>was also a national best seller. A more playful twist is the Looking-Glass series: <i>Into the Looking Glass</i>, <i>Vorpal Blade</i>, <i>Manxome Foe</i> and <i>Claws That Catch</i>, the last three in collaboration with Travis S. Taylor. His audience was further enhanced with four collaborations with fellow <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author David Weber: <i>March Upcountry</i>,<i> March to the Sea</i>, <i>March to the Stars</i> and <i>We Few</i>. There are an additional five collaborative spinoffs from the Posleen series: <i>The </i><i>Hero</i>, written with Michael Z.

A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, he brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Prolific military SF author Ringo (the Posleen War series) imbues this near-future epic with a somewhat self-indulgent air, mixing lengthy and sometimes interminable discussions of science and economics with do-or-die action. Three years after the alien Grtul drop a transport gate in our solar system and welcome Earth to the galactic community, a Horvath warship shows up and destroys several major cities before extorting protection payments. Fast-thinking entrepreneur Tyler Vernon exploits the literally universal appeal of maple syrup to make a fortune, defies the Horvath, and reveals his ideas for keeping Earth safe, but intergalactic war threatens to derail his plan. This extended thought exercise is infused with plenty of old-fashioned two-fisted can-do attitude, a heavy dose of science, and occasional bursts of dry humor, but shallow characterization and an ambling plot detract from the overall experience. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

W. Leadbeater were pioneers in asserting that thoughts are, indeed, things. Originally released in 1901, <i>Thought-Forms</i> is a seminal work on what thoughts &#x201c;look&#x201d; like.

Based on the authors&#x2019; clairvoyant vision, its illustrations suggest the form thoughts take in relation, for instance, to anger, fear, intellect, sympathy, devotion, and a meditative state. Annie Besant herself describes the book&#x2019;s purpose as being to &#x201c;serve as a striking moral lesson to every reader, making him realize the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble and a curb to the base.

Now the judge is a shadow of his former self, a sick, lonely old man who has withdrawn to his sprawling ancestral home. Knowing the end is near, Judge Atlee has issued a summons for his two sons to return to Clanton to discuss his estate. Ray Atlee is the eldest, a Virginia law professor, newly single and still enduring the aftershocks of a surprise divorce. Forrest is Ray&#x2019;s younger brother, who redefines the notion of a family&#x2019;s black sheep.<br><br>The summons is typed by the judge himself, on his handsome old stationery, and gives the date and time for Ray and Forrest to appear in his study. Ray reluctantly heads south to his hometown, to the place where he grew up and now prefers to avoid. But the family meeting does not take place. The judge dies too soon, and in doing so leaves behind a shocking secret known only to Ray.<br><br>And perhaps someone else.</p><p>Law professor Ray Atlee and his prodigal brother, Forrest, are summoned home to Clanton, Mississippi, by their ailing father to discuss his will. But when Ray arrives the judge is already dead, and the one-page document dividing his meager estate between the two sons seems crystal clear. What it doesn't mention, however, is the small fortune in cash Ray discovers hidden in the old man's house--$3 million he can't account for and doesn't mention to brother Forrest, either.<p> Ray's efforts to keep his find a secret, figure out where it came from, and hide it from a nameless extortioner, who seems to know more about it than he does, culminate in a denouement with an almost biblical twist. It's a slender plot to hang a thriller on, and in truth it's not John Grisham's best in terms of pacing, dramatic tension, and interesting characters (except for Harry Rex, a country lawyer who was the judge's closest friend and in many ways is the father Ray wishes he'd had. He's so vivid he jumps off the page). But Grisham's legions of fans are likely to enjoy <i>The Summons</i> even if it lacks the power of some of his classic earlier books, like <i>The Firm</i>, <i>The Brethren</i>, and <i>The Testament</i>. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>&#x201c;<b>The Summons</b> ranks as my absolute favorite in many years...[with] an ending too delicious and morally instructive to give away.&#x201d;<br>--<i>USA Today<br><br></i>&#x201c;A pleasure to read...a good yarn.&#x201d;<br>--<i>The Washington Post<br></i></p><h2>Mourad: New Moroccan</h2><p><i>A soulful chef creates his first masterpiece</i><br><br>What Mourad Lahlou has developed over the last decade and a half at his Michelin-starred&nbsp;San Francisco restaurant is nothing less than a new, modern Moroccan cuisine, inspired by memories, steeped in colorful stories, and informed by the tireless&nbsp;exploration of his curious mind.

Ghost of Chance was first published by Serpent&#39;s Tail in hardback in 1997.Burroughs (My Education: A Book of Dreams) turns 81 this year, but, much to the delight of loyal readers, his latest fiction continues to display a febrile imagination, corrosive wit and edgy desolation recalling his preeminent early work. This peculiar, short volume is a whimsical hodgepodge, interweaving, among other matters, a natural history of Madagascar; a jeremiad for the environment; a colonial adventure and a takeoff on the Book of Revelations. It opens as Captain Mission, an 18th-century pirate, founds Libertatia, a utopian colony on Madagascar dedicated to protecting the indigenous landscape and lemur population (lemurs are known by island natives as "ghosts"). When international bureaucrats conspire to decimate the colony, overpopulate the island and plunder its flora and fauna ("the Garden of Lost Chances," preserved for 160 million years since the island split from mainland Africa), a series of fantastic, ancient plagues are released, destroying much of the earth.

In his first cookbook, Pawson brings this philosophy of simplicity to the kitchen. <br><br>In <b>Living &amp; Eating</b>, using methods similar to those he brings to structural design, John Pawson creates simple menus that underscore the unique character of each ingredient. Beginning with a sound foundation, Pawson advises us on the cornerstones of quality in food. In the recipes that follow, he emphasizes the strengths of particular ingredients. The simple poached egg, for example, relies on nothing more than fresh eggs, boiling water, and a splash of vinegar to attain its perfect degree of richness. A more complex dish, such as Lemon Risotto, blends the robust flavors of citrus zest, aged cheeses, and savory broth into a creamy mixture in which each element is maximized.<br><br>The color photographs that illustrate the book were taken in Pawson&#x2019;s elegantly spare London townhouse and demonstrate perfectly his vision of uncluttered luxury. Separated into two main parts, <b>Living &amp; Eating</b> covers both cooking and home design.</p><p>What do architectural design and food have in common? According to internationally acclaimed architect John Pawson and celebrated food writer Annie Bell, both are best when pared down to their essentials. Their goal in <i>Living and Eating</i> is to enrich the experience of living by getting rid of everything that is unnecessary and distracting, leaving us with the elements that truly matter. They seek to enhance the time we spend in the kitchen and at the table without expending extra time or effort.<p> The recipes are stunning--surely impressive enough to wow guests--but all are exceedingly simple to prepare. In Red Wine Risotto, wine cloaks the rice with a lustrous deep crimson emulsion and creates a delectably silky texture. Only butter, a chopped onion, chicken stock, and a little Parmesan are needed to complete the dish. Roast Monkfish is smeared with an anchovy-rosemary-lemon-butter and wrapped with prosciutto. As it bakes, a deliciously buttery sauce is formed, perfect for mopping up with chunks of crusty bread.</p><p> Pawson and Bell include no fewer than nine recipes for roast chicken--from homey Chicken Roasted with Garlic to the more exotic Roast Guinea Hen with Pistachio and Lemon Crumbs. Desserts are likewise familiar, while at the same time elegant enough to serve to guests. Baked Couscous Pudding with Raisins offers a clever twist on rice pudding--and it's equally rich and satisfying. Pan-Poached Nectarines in Spiced Wine Syrup are exotically scented with lemongrass and cardamom pods.</p><p> With its spare page design and stunning photographs of Pawson's extraordinary home, <i>Living and Eating</i> will surely strike a chord with anyone looking for a simpler way to live, eat, and entertain. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>Architect JOHN PAWSON has worked with clients such as Martha Stewart and Calvin Klein.

Near the Tower of London, along the River Thames, the body of a woman has been discovered chained to a stone post and left to drown. Curiously, only one set of footprints leads to the tragic spot. &#x201c;The Bride in the Tide,&#x201d; as the London press gleefully dubs her, has the PCU stumped. Why wouldn&#x2019;t the killer simply dump her body in the river&#x2014;as so many do?<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur Bryant wonders if the answer lies in the mythology of the Thames itself. Unfortunately, the normally wobbly funhouse corridors of Bryant&#x2019;s mind have become, of late, even more labyrinthine. The venerable detective seems to be losing his grip on reality. May fears the worst, as Bryant rapidly descends from merely muddled to one stop short of Barking, hallucinating that he&#x2019;s traveled back in time to solve the case. There had better be a method to Bryant&#x2019;s madness&#x2014;because, as more bodies are pulled from the river&#x2019;s depths, his partner and the rest of the PCU find themselves in over their heads.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fiendishly fun and rich in London lore, <i>Bryant and May: Strange Tide </i>is Christopher Fowler at his best, delivering more twists and turns than the Thames itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Christopher Fowler&#x2019;s ingenious novels featuring the Peculiar Crimes Unit</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fowler, like his crime-solvers, is deadpan, sly, and always unexpectedly inventive.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;An imaginative funhouse of a world where sage minds go to expand their vistas and sharpen their wits.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[Fowler] takes delight in stuffing his books with esoteric facts; together with a cast of splendidly eccentric characters [and] corkscrew plots, wit, verve and some apposite social commentary, they make for unbeatable fun.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Mr. Fowler&#x2019;s small but ardent American following deserves to get much larger.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;The most delightfully, wickedly entertaining duo in crime fiction.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Plain Dealer</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Captivating.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Seattle Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dazzling.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Denver Post</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thrilling.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><p><b>Christopher Fowler </b>is the acclaimed author of the award-winning <i>Full Dark House </i>and twelve other Peculiar Crimes Unit mysteries: <i>The Water Room, Seventy-Seven Clocks, Ten Second Staircase, White Corridor, The Victoria Vanishes, Bryant &amp; May on the Loose, Bryant &amp; May off the Rails, The Memory of Blood, The Invisible Code, Bryant &amp; May and the Bleeding Heart, Bryant &amp; May and the Burning Man, </i>and<i> Bryant &amp; May: Strange Tide,</i> as well as the PCU story collection<i> London&#x2019;s Glory</i>.

The scratch of the nib as it scarred the paper always sent a tingle through his fingertips.<br><br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve decided to write up that business of the Clapham Common Casanova,&#x2019; he announced, turning to the new notebook on his desk and opening it with a theatrical flourish. Uncapping his fountain pen, he made a grand downward stroke.<br><br> Nothing came out.<br><br> He shook the pen violently. Ink spots flew all over the office. Crippen, who had been happily sleeping beside his desk, sprinted from the room.<br><br> &#x2018;I thought Raymond didn&#x2019;t want you circulating any more of your dodgy memoirs,&#x2019; said John May. &#x2018;You make our investigations sound like terrible old paperback murder mysteries.&#x2019; He swiped irritably at his smartphone. &#x2018;Why won&#x2019;t this thing sync properly?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Nothing modern works properly,&#x2019; Bryant cheerfully replied. &#x2018;Everything is overcomplicated. The office tea bags are sentient, apparently. They have a Twitter account. It says so on the box. Dan Banbury bought me electronic bathroom scales for my birthday. They told everyone on Facebook how much I weigh. I don&#x2019;t need inanimate objects slagging me off.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;But you still use them?&#x2019; asked May.<br><br> &#x2018;No; tragically, they fell under the wheels of my car. Your phone is probably working fine, you&#x2019;re just losing the ability to keep up with it.

No amount of colouring your hair and sucking in your gut will change that.&#x2019; Pleased with himself, he sat back and took a sip from his tea mug.<br><br> It is said that the hallmark of a gentleman is that he is only ever rude intentionally. Arthur Bryant was no gentleman. His rudeness came from an inability to cloak his opinions in even the most cursory civility. He believed in good manners at the meal table and bad manners almost everywhere else.<br><br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a very unpleasant old man,&#x2019; May replied, returning to his phone.<br><br> &#x2018;What&#x2019;s the point in consensual opinion?&#x2019; Bryant asked, exasperated. &#x2018;If you only discuss matters of interest with like-�minded individuals you never learn anything new. Why would I want a peer group on Twitter? They&#x2019;re just going to agree with me.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Nobody ever agrees with you, and besides, you&#x2019;re not even supposed to be here.

One, please don&#x2019;t call it by the name a tabloid reporter coined after a five-�bottle lunch, and B, it&#x2019;s the only case I won&#x2019;t ever be able to write up in my superbly erudite and illuminating chronicles.&#x2019;<br><br> May gave up with his phone and set it aside. &#x2018;Why not?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Because,&#x2019; Bryant pointed out, &#x2018;it&#x2019;s one of the only times we nailed the culprit but were given the slip. My public wants to read about the successes, not the failures.&#x2019; He rose and walked over to the window, to jingle the change in his pockets and survey his kingdom.<br><br> &#x2018;Your public?&#x2019; asked May. &#x2018;You haven&#x2019;t got a public. You were complaining about your phone not ringing the other day. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with it; you&#x2019;ve never given anyone your number. Anyway, the case wasn&#x2019;t an entire failure. Your suspicions turned out to be justified.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;It still didn&#x2019;t end up with a spell in the pokey for&#x2014;�I forget the name of the malefactor now.

The houses on the other side were ochreish and meanly windowed.<br> &#x2018;Queen Boadicea. She&#x2019;s over the road, just past the fried chicken shop. How very odd.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Take one of your yellow pills,&#x2019; said May, allowing his fingers to creep back towards his phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>|||</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Boadicea, the great warrior queen, was sitting on a garden wall opposite, dangling her silver sandals over its edge, her coarse-�woven purple robe gathered about her waist, her golden breastplate glinting in the cold morning sunlight. The breeze ruffled the dyed red leveret fur on her bronze helmet. She was contemplatively licking the side of a 99.<br><br> &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know how you can eat that,&#x2019; said the Roman centurion next to her. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s bloody freezing.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m the Queen of the Iceni,&#x2019; said Boadicea. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t feel the cold.&#x2019;<br><br> The centurion pointed to her ice cream. &#x2018;Why is it that the flakes in those things never taste as good as the Cadbury Flakes you buy in the yellow wrappers?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t comment,&#x2019; said Boadicea. &#x2018;Chocolate hasn&#x2019;t been invented yet.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t have to stay in character all the time.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;When I was a kid we spelled it B-�O-�A-�D-�I-�C-�E-�A. That was how everybody spelled it. Then all of a sudden it was B-�O-�U-�D-�I-�C-�C-�A. Where did that come from?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;You were a Victorian misprint.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got my own statue on Westminster Bridge. You&#x2019;d think they could sort out my name.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;It&#x2019;s B-�U-�D-�D-�U-�G in Welsh,&#x2019; said the centurion, who was Welsh.<br><br> &#x2018;They don&#x2019;t even know where I died! It was either Watling Street, East Anglia or over there, under platform nine.&#x2019; She pointed to the great arched glass roof of King&#x2019;s Cross Station in the distance.<br><br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;re thinking of Harry Potter,&#x2019; said the centurion.<br><br> &#x2018;Did you even bother to do any research before you took this part?&#x2019; Boadicea asked, gnawing the end off her cone.<br><br> &#x2018;It was hardly worth it,&#x2019; said the centurion. &#x2018;I just come on, shout a bit and get a spear shoved through me.&#x2019; In the gardens behind him, the second assistant director called everyone back to their places. &#x2018;Looks like they&#x2019;re going for another take,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Are you in this scene?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;No, I&#x2019;ve finished for the day.&#x2019; She crunched up the last of her wafer and wiped her fingers on a dock leaf. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to get out of this outfit. I thought it would be a bit of a novelty doing location work instead of green-�screening everything down at Pinewood, but I&#x2019;ve spent most of my time staring out at King&#x2019;s Cross and watching plainclothes coppers going in and out of that building on the corner.&#x2019; She pointed up at the headquarters of the Peculiar Crimes Unit on Caledonian Road.<br><br> &#x2018;How do you know they&#x2019;re coppers if they&#x2019;re in plain clothes?&#x2019; the centurion asked.<br><br> &#x2018;They have big feet and matching jackets and are always carrying takeaways,&#x2019; said Boadicea. &#x2018;What else could they be? I wonder what they do in there all day.&#x2019;<br><br> The centurion shrugged. &#x2018;What do you care? You&#x2019;ve been dead for nearly two thousand years.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x2019; said the warrior queen. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m an&nbsp;<i>actor</i>. I observe humanity.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;re an extra, love,&#x2019; said the centurion. &#x2018;And what could you possibly learn from watching a bunch of plainclothes plods?&#x2019;<br><br> Boadicea waved a ringed finger in the direction of Raymond Land&#x2019;s first-�floor window in the Peculiar Crimes Unit. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve learned that the bloke who sits in that room doesn&#x2019;t do any work,&#x2019; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Mew Mew to the Rescue (Tokyo Mew-Mew, Vol.1)</h2><p>An accident at a museum endows 11-year old Momomiya with the DNA of wildcats.

His ideas spread across Europe like wildfire, offering the scientific point of view that the natural world, including the soul of man, was a proper subject of study. The Catholic Church convulsed, and riots took place at the universities of Paris and Oxford.<br> Richard Rubenstein recounts with energy and vigor this magnificent story of the intellectual ferment that planted the seeds of the scientific age in Europe and reflects our own struggles with faith and reason.<br></p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100720-9<br>"A superb storyteller who breathes new life into such fascinating figures as Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, William of Ockham and Aristotle himself." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>The intellectual explosion that transformed Europe in the Middle Ages and coursed through the Western world, triggered student riots and heresy trials, and set the stage for today's rift between reason and religion. The ideas came from Aristotle. His work, like the rest of Greek culture, had been lost in the centuries after the fall of Rome, when the Greek language was forgotten. But in the Muslim world, the wisdom of the Greeks was never lost and contributed to the flowering of Islamic culture. <br><br>When scholars in the twelfth century collaborated on translating the ancient classics, they resurrected ideas that turned Western thinking away from the supernatural world and toward the world of nature. With their optimistic view of human nature, these ideas sparked fierce controversies in the universities and caused major changes in the Catholic Church. Rubenstein shows how the Church adopted these new ideas and struggled to reconcile science and religion and how Western thinking was set on the path it has followed ever since.<br><br>This is a feast for readers who are fascinated by medieval history, and a treat for all who want to understand the ideas that are fundamental to modern thought.<br><br>Richard E.

NKGB or Odessa? Who can tell? The deeper he pushes, the more secrets tumble out: a scheme to swap Nazi gold for currency, a religious cult organized around Himmler himself, an NKGB agent who is actually working for the Mossad, a German cousin who turns out to be more malevolent than he appears--and a distractingly attractive newspaperwoman who seems to be asking an awful lot of questions.

Cronley Jr. sat in the back of an olive-drab 1942 Chevrolet staff car in his &#x201c;pinks and greens,&#x201d; which is how officers referred to the &#x201c;Class A&#x201d; semi-dress uniform, puffing on a long black cigar, despite a sign on the back of the front seat that read both no smoking! and rauchen verboten!</p><p>Jim Cronley was a six-foot-tall, blond-haired and blue-eyed Texan. The crossed sabers on his lapels identified him as a cavalryman, and his shoulder insignia&#x2014;a three-inch yellow circle outlined in black, with a C in the center pierced by a red lightning bolt&#x2014;identified him as a member of the U.S. Constabulary, which policed the American Zone of Occupied Germany.</p><p>Three and a half hours before, the telephone on his desk in the Compound, which housed the S�d-Deutsche Industrielle Entwicklungsorganisation<i> </i>(South German Industrial Development Organization) in Pullach, a small village about twenty miles from Munich, had flashed a red button, which had caused him to say &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; as he reached for it.</p><p>His office was in a small, neat building identified by a sign on its small, now snow-covered lawn as the Office of the OMGUS Liaison Officer. OMGUS was the acronym for Office of Military Government, U.S.</p><p>It was, de facto, the headquarters of DCI-Europe, the Directorate of Central Intelligence, which had been formed several months before to replace the Office of Strategic Services by President Harry S Truman and answered only to him.</p><p>The OMGUS sign was an obfuscation, a smoke screen, so to speak, to conceal the truth. So was the Constabulary shoulder �insignia on Jim Cronley&#x2019;s tunic. He was not assigned to the Constabulary. He was listed on the War Department&#x2019;s &#x201c;Detached Officer Roster,&#x201d; which is classified Secret, as being assigned to the Directorate of Central Intelligence.</p><p>He was, in fact, chief, DCI-Europe.</p><p>So was the South German Industrial Development Organization an obfuscation to conceal what had once been Abwehr Ost&#x2014;Intelligence East&#x2014;of the Wehrmacht. Generalmajor Reinhard Gehlen had made a deal with Allen Dulles, then the OSS station chief in Switzerland, not only to surrender to the Americans but to bring with him all his assets, which included agents inside the Kremlin, and to place him and them at the service of the Americans. In exchange, Dulles agreed to protect Gehlen&#x2019;s officers and enlisted men, and their families, from the Russians.</p><p>&#x201c;Cronley,&#x201d; Cronley had said into the handset of the secure �telephone.</p><p>&#x201c;ASA Fulda, sir. Hold for Major Wallace.&#x201d;</p><p>The Army Security Agency was charged with making sure the Army&#x2019;s communications network was not compromised, and, in addition to other services, providing secure encrypted telephone, Teletype, and radio communications.</p><p>&#x201c;Major Wallace, we have Captain Cronley on a secure line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited to Colonel Bob Mattingly&#x2019;s &#x2018;Farewell to USFET&#x2019; party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I must regretfully decline the kind invitation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be held at Schlosshotel Kronberg.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As I have a previous social engagement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So put on your pinks and greens and get in your airplane within the next thirty minutes. A car will be waiting for you at Eschborn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And wear your DSM.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was told I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to wear it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a special occasion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t gonna wear the damned thing, which is sort of moot, since I ain&#x2019;t going to fly up there to play nice with Mattingly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When you get an order, Captain Cronley, the correct response is &#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>After a ten-second pause, Cronley said, &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>More obfuscation was in play here.</p><p>In order to make DCI-Europe seem less important than it was, to have it sort of fade into the background, it was decided that it be commanded, as far as anyone outside of DCI was concerned, by a junior officer. Such an officer was available in the person of Jim Cronley, who had just been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and promoted from second lieutenant to captain at the verbal order of the President of the United States. The Citation stated that he had demonstrated <i>at the risk of his own life not only valor above and beyond the call of duty but a wisdom far beyond that to be expected of an officer of his age and rank while engaged in a classified operation of great importance</i>.</p><p>DCI-Europe was important, and not only because it was �involved in surreptitiously keeping former members of Abwehr Ost, and their families, many of them Nazis, out of the hands of the Russians by surreptitiously flying them to Argentina. This �activity, should it become public knowledge, would have seen �Truman&#x2014;who had authorized Allen Dulles to make the deal with Gehlen&#x2014;very possibly impeached, even if Eisenhower, who had brought the deal to Truman, agreed to fall on his sword to save the commander in chief.</p><p>Under these conditions, it was obviously necessary to have some experienced intelligence officer looking over Cronley&#x2019;s shoulder to &#x201c;advise&#x201d; him and, should it become necessary, to take �DCI-Europe over. Such an officer was available in the person of Major Harold Wallace, who had been commander of OSS-�Forward until its dissolution, and was now assigned to USFET Counterintelligence.</p><p>And there was more obfuscation here, too. In order to keep &#x201c;Army G-2 off my back,&#x201d; as Wallace, a full colonel, had phrased it, he had taken the eagle off his epaulets and replaced it with the golden leaf of a major and allowed the Army to think Colonel Robert Mattingly was actually commanding OSS-Forward.</p><p>Major Wallace was given command of the XXVIIth CIC �Detachment in Munich, from which position he was able to look over the activities of the XXIIIrd CIC Detachment, commanded by Captain James D. Cronley, which had been established to provide Cronley with a credible reason for being in Munich, in the hope that people would not connect him with DCI-Europe at the Compound.</p><p>Originally, Cronley was not told of Wallace&#x2019;s role, but he soon figured it out. They worked out an amicable relationship, largely because Cronley accepted that Wallace could give him orders.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>[TWO]</b></p><p>As Cronley entered the lobby of the Schlosshotel, a bellman snatched his canvas Valv-Pak from his hand and led him to the desk.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to need a room,&#x201d; he said to the clerk.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry, Captain, the Schlosshotel Kronberg is a senior officers&#x2019; hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought this was a low-class dump the moment I walked in,&#x201d; Cronley said, his automatic mouth having gone into action.</p><p>Another clerk rushed over.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Sind Sie Hauptmann Cronley, Herr Hauptmann?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Ja.&#x201d;</i></p><p>The clerk switched to English.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve put you in 110, Captain. Your bag will be there whenever it&#x2019;s convenient for you to go there.&#x201d; He handed Cronley a key, which came attached to a brass plate with the number on it.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Cronley,&#x201d; a voice said in his ear, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;ll come with me, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>He turned to see a naval officer, a full lieutenant, who had the silver aiguillettes of an aide-de-camp dangling from his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Who the hell are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the admiral&#x2019;s aide, sir,&#x201d; he replied, his tone suggesting &#x201c;dumb question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What admiral?&#x201d;</p><p>The lieutenant didn&#x2019;t reply, instead gesturing for Cronley to follow him. Cronley did so, out of the lobby and down a corridor, where the lieutenant opened half of a double door, gestured for Cronley to precede him, and then bellowed, &#x201c;Admiral, Captain Cronley.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley looked into the room. There were six people sitting around a table on which were three bottles of whiskey, an ice bucket, and a soda siphon. He recognized two of them. Harold Wallace and Oscar Schultz. He saw that Wallace had the silver eagles of his actual rank on the epaulets. Oscar was in a business&nbsp;suit.</p><p><i>And that has to be Admiral Souers. All that gold on his sleeves.</i></p><p><i>What the hell is going on here?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well, come on in,&#x201d; Schultz called. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t just stand there.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley walked up to the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the protocol. Am I supposed to salute?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try saying, &#x2018;Good evening, gentlemen,&#x2019;&#x201d; the admiral said, as he stood up.</p><p>&#x201c;Good evening, gentlemen.&#x201d;</p><p>The admiral put out his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sid Souers, son, and I&#x2019;m glad to finally meet you. You know Colonel Wallace, of course, and Mr. Schultz, and you&#x2019;ve just met my aide, Tommy Peterson. These fellows are, left to right, Bill Conroy, Jack Kingsbury, and Tony Henderson.

By direction of the President, the Legion of Merit is awarded to Captain James D. Cronley Junior, Cavalry, Army of the United States. Citation: Captain Cronley was called upon to assume command of the Directorate of Central Intelligence&#x2013;Europe when circumstances did not permit the assignment of an appropriately senior officer to that position. During his tenure as chief, DCI-Europe, Captain Cronley demonstrated characteristics of leadership and professionalism far above those to be expected of someone of his rank and length of service. He also proved his willingness to risk his life above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions when carrying out his duties. His outstanding performance and his valor reflected great credit upon the Directorate of Central Intelligence and the Office of the President of the United States. By Order of Harry S Truman, President of the United States and commander in chief of its Armed Forces.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p><i>What that sounds like is that I am no longer chief, DCI-Europe.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wipe that confused look off your face and try to look serious while I pin this thing on, Cronley,&#x201d; the admiral said. &#x201c;The �pictures are for President Truman.&#x201d;</p><p>Cronley did his best to comply with the order.</p><p>&#x201c;You got enough, Jack?&#x201d; the admiral asked of the man with the Leica.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Now I suggest someone pour Cronley a drink before he starts asking questions.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked back to the table, sat down, and motioned for Cronley to take the seat beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch or bourbon, Captain?&#x201d; the admiral&#x2019;s aide asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The drinks were poured.</p><p>The admiral raised his glass.</p><p>&#x201c;To Captain James D.

And you know I don&#x2019;t deserve the Legion of Merit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean, son, that you did come down with the clap?&#x201d;</p><p>There was laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, serious answers. You ever hear, son, what Eisenhower replied when someone asked him the secret of his success at �Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ike said, &#x2018;I think it&#x2019;s my knack of getting people who, with reason, hate each other to work together.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;Ike came to see me. Somehow, he had learned of us going to G-2 at the War Department with those movies you had made with those two Peenem�nde Nazis. The Blackmail Movie, as Jack put it. <i>Lay off DCI or we&#x2019;ll show these movies to the President.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ike said, &#x2018;Sid, you&#x2014;we&#x2014;won this one, but the war between your man Cronley and General Seidel has to be called off. General Seidel is not going to quit until he buries Cronley. His ego is involved. And in trying to bury your young captain, he&#x2019;s likely to do something that will cause Operation Ost to blow up in our face, which means the President&#x2019;s face, and our primary obligation is to protect him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;I asked Ike what he had in mind, and surprising me not at all, it made a hell of a lot of sense, so I took it to the President, and he agreed, a little reluctantly, to it. Harry said it looked like you were getting the shitty end of the stick, and he didn&#x2019;t like that. Hence, the Legion of Merit, and his own contribution to Operation Peace.</p><p>&#x201c;What Ike is going to do is transfer General Seidel to the Pentagon, where Ike will tell him to lay off DCI. He will also tell him that you&#x2019;ve been relieved as chief, DCI-Europe, and that an officer of suitable rank and experience has been appointed to that position, Harold Wallace.

Young Sophie has often wondered about her unusual great-aunt, Auntie Claus. She lives in penthouse 25C at the Bing Cherry Hotel and is <i>so </i>curioso! After all, Auntie Claus serves Christmas cookies all year long and her tree is always the best-decorated in the city. And then there's her annual "business trip," right around the holidays.

Put on your mittens and bundle up for an adventure beyond your wildest dreams. <i>Ho, ho, ho!</i><br></p><p><blockquote> <i>"Sophie wondered about her great-aunt a lot.<br> She's so</i> mysterioso! <i>Sophie thought. And this was true.<br> There were many strange goings-on up in penthouse 25C. Most people considered Auntie Claus just another eccentric New Yorker. But Sophie knew there was more to her than met the eye."</i> </blockquote><p> As if Auntie Claus's everyday red velvet gown with furry white trim isn't unusual enough, there is the diamond key that hangs around her neck. During her year-round tea and Christmas cookie rituals, she always leaves young Sophie with the words, "And darling, always remember my first and final rule--whether it's birthdays, Christmas, or Halloween, it is far better to give than to receive!" Oddest of all, every year she departs on a "business trip" right after Halloween and doesn't return until Valentine's Day. </p><p> One year, the spoiled and rather unpleasant Sophie (who, like her little brother, is all about "receiving," and as much as possible) decides to stop wondering about her great-aunt and start investigating. She stows away in a large box, is loaded into a <i>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</i>-style enclosure with all of her great-aunt's luggage, and is shot off into the sky. Landing with a <i>thunk</i>, she is greeted by Mr. Pudding, who assumes she is the new elf and sets her to work in the mailroom. As Mr. Pudding extols the virtues of hard work, Sophie thinks, "Rules, <i>schmules</i>." But her work hasn't quite yet begun. When Santa asks for one brave elf to volunteer to go to the coal mines and pick up the "B-B-and-G List," Sophie gets nervous. The B-B-and-G List is the list of bad boys and girls who will go without Christmas presents... or worse. She volunteers, thinking she just may be on that list. But when it's her little brother she sees on the list, Sophie finally learns the important lesson that Auntie Claus has been trying to teach her. When that happens, Sophie whirls up out of the coal mines into the Grand Ballroom of the North Pole, where Auntie Claus is revealed to be Santa's sister with much fanfare.</p><p> Award-winning illustrator Elise Primavera's gorgeous artwork is positively luminous, recalling the splendid Christmas television specials <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> and the Claymation version of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i> in extraordinary compositions, compellingly portrayed characters, and unusual perspectives.

John and his brothers were removed from their family at a young age. They spent nearly seven years in one of New York State s worst foster homes surviving mental and physical abuse. The home was eventually shut down and he ended up at various violent boys homes and institutions. Early January 1977, when New York City was bankrupt, corrupt and the murder capital of the America, John escaped and took to the street. He was 14 years old, homeless, living through the Son of Sam killings, the infamous Blackout of 1977, and rampant out-of-control New York City violence. He survived those tumultuous days and nights alone, sleeping in burnt-out buildings, acting as a heroin drug-mule, a street dealer, and a hustler. In late 1978 his life crashed down as he was incarcerated for close to two years in New York State s worst juvenile facility, Spofford Correctional then to an upstate lock up. But what s most compelling about John s story is how he overcame the obstacles and adversity: his loss of family and his serious addictions to crack cocaine, drugs and alcohol. John wrote his critically acclaimed memoir, The Evolution of a Cro-Magnon , published in 2007 as a way to exercise his demons. Then in 2014 Harper Collins released his book Meat is For Pussies , an in-your-face look at guys health which has become an underground success and has helped thousands of men change their bad eating habits and lifestyles. He s replaced the Iron Bars of the prison system with the Ironman Triathlon as a way to constantly challenge himself physically, mentally and spiritually. John still tours as the lead singer with the world-famous Cro-Mags, the group which everyone from Metallica to Black Flag to Green Day credit as one of the most influential punk rock bands of all time. &nbsp; As of late John speaks in gang-affiliated high schools, prisons and lock-ups to incarcerated men and women as a way to help them move in a positive direction. He's also the co-creator of the documentary "30 to Life" which is currently being filmed in Los Angeles and helps parolees avoid returning to prison by educating them in the same life changing principles which have kept him out of prison.</p><h2>Blood on the River: James Town 1607</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Samuel Collier is a lowly commoner on the streets of London. So when he becomes the page of Captain John Smith and boards the ship the Susan Constant, bound for the New World, he can&#x2019;t believe his good fortune. He&#x2019;s heard that gold washes ashore with every tide. But beginning with the stormy journey and his first contact with the native people, he realizes that the New World is nothing like he had ever imagined.The lush Virginia shore where they establish the colony of James Town is both beautiful and forbidding, and it&#x2019;s hard to know who&#x2019;s a friend or foe. As he learns the language of the Algonquin Indians and observes Captain Smith&#x2019;s wise diplomacy, Samuel begins to see that he can be whomever he wants to be in this new land.</p><p>Elisa Carbone lives in Maryland and West Virginia.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 5-7&#x2013;After attempting to steal back a necklace that belonged to his deceased mother, Samuel Collier is sent to an orphanage run by Reverend Hunt. The 11-year-old joins him on a journey to the New World, serving as a page to Captain John Smith. Samuel's account of the voyage to Virginia, political intrigues among the settlers, and the harrowing first winter of the James Town settlement brings to life figures like Smith, Powhatan, and Pocahontas. Details about food and daily life add realism to the story, and quotes from historical sources begin each chapter. This Samuel is more conflicted than the one in Gail Langer Karwoski's <i>Surviving Jamestown: The Adventures of Young Sam Collier</i> (Peachtree, 2001). His initial selfishness changes as he responds to the reverend, to Smith, and to his new friends. His time in an Indian village and his changing perspectives on the Natives add interest to the story and depth to his character. While the opening chapters move slowly, the pace picks up as Samuel reaches Virginia. This title is a good choice for a tie-in with the 400th anniversary celebrations of Jamestown in 2007.<i>&#x2013;Beth L.

Why? "Because, " Ms. Haber said, "it expresses, through food, joy . . . you have the connection of food being celebratory in truly meaningful ways. Just wonderful stuff." <br>Starting with a freedman's wagon ride out of Texas, Cleora Butler takes us from the beaten biscuits of her childhood, baked in a wood-burning stove, to fricasseed quail she later prepared as a caterer. Rich with stories and turn-of-the-century recipes impossible to find -- possum grape wine, mother's hickory nut cake, hot water cornbread, and burnt sugar ice cream -- Cleora's Kitchens also provides a glimpse of changing twentieth-century tastes. More than 400 recipes are arranged by the decades in which she first cooked and served them, from grandpa's sausage in the early days to the first avocado anyone in Oklahoma had ever seen, to duckling pati and pine nut pilaf.

Illustrated throughout in full color.<br></p><p>RALPH STEADMAN has illustrated many books, including Hunter S.

Animating Steadman's ebullient, bristling, irreverent prose are kinetic, gracefully sensuous, and utterly inimitable images that pulsate with enthusiasm for his chosen subject. This visual feast is appropriate accompaniment to Steadman's text, which keenly enables the reader to vicariously experience wineries from Bordeaux to Oporto and on to Napa Valley (imbibing at least in spirit along with the author). Anyone with a soupcon of joie de vivre will be besotted with Steadman's first-class style as raconteur, wine expert, and travel writer. Fine printing and production increase the book's appeal. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Fear Nothing</h2><p>Fear, compassion, evil, courage, hope, wonder, the exquisite terror of not knowing what will happen on the next page to characters you care about deeply&#x2014;these are the marvels that Dean Koontz weaves into the unique tapestry of every novel.

For Christopher Snow has made his peace with a very rare genetic disorder shared by only one thousand other Americans, a disorder that leaves him dangerously vulnerable to light. His life is filled with the fascinating rituals of one who must embrace the dark. He knows the night as no one else ever will, ever can&#x2014;the mystery, the beauty, the many terrors, and the eerie, silken rhythms of the night&#x2014;for it is only at night that he is free.<br><br>Until the night he witnesses a series of disturbing incidents that sweep him into a violent mystery only he can solve, a mystery that will force him to rise above all fears and confront the many-layered strangeness of Moonlight Bay and its residents.<br><br>Once again drawing daringly from several genres, Dean Koontz has created a narrative that is a thriller, a mystery, a wild adventure, a novel of friendship, a rousing story of triumph over severe physical limitations, and a haunting cautionary tale.</p><p>If you think you've got it tough, meet Christopher Snow, the hero of Dean Koontz's novel <i>Fear Nothing</i>. Not only did his parents die under mysterious circumstances, but he's also being stalked by shadowy characters who want Snow to stop trying to find out how they died--or else they'll bump off his remaining loved ones (his supersmart, beer-lapping dog Orson; his best surfing buddy Bobby; and his late-night deejay girlfriend Sasha). And as if being on the lam in his own hometown, Moonlight Bay, California, isn't bad enough, Snow has to outrun his pursuers without leaving town. He has XP--xeroderma pigmentosum--a rare genetic affliction that forces him to avoid light. Cumulative exposure to sun, fluorescent lights, and the like will give him cancer eventually, and he doesn't dare leave the place where he's skillfully "done the mambo with melanoma" for all of his 28 years. Koontz makes the night-town of Moonlight Bay come alive in this sometimes pulse-pounding, sometimes funny, but mostly rather lyrical thriller. Fans of Koontz's legendary 1986 novel <i>Watchers</i> will love this book's similar theme: our hero and a loveable super-dog deal with a genetic engineering laboratory run amok. Horror fans will savor the evil mutant rhesus "millennium monkeys" who hunt Snow, the few scenes of eloquent gore, and the plight of certain mutating townsfolk who are, as they put it, "becoming" something very creepy. <p> Koontz gives Snow and Bobby a lingo that does for surfer talk what Austin Powers did for the Swinging '60s, and his metaphors are almost as madcap as Tom Robbins's: "As the chains of the swinging light fixture torqued, the links twisted against one another with enough friction to cause an eerie ringing, as if lizard-eyed altar boys in blood-soaked cassocks and surplices were ringing the unmelodious bells of a satanic mass." Sometimes Koontz's style goes over the top and wipes out, surfer-style, but for the most part, <i>Fear Nothing</i> will have readers bellowing "Cowabunga!"</p><br></p><h2>Was God on Vacation?</h2><p>A World War II autobiography of a Dutch youth during the years 1940-1947.

Born in Portland, Maine, and educated at Bowdoin College, Longfellow&#x2019;s ambition was always to become a writer; but until mid-life his first profession was the teaching rather than the production of literature, at his alma mater (1829-35) and then at Harvard (1836-54). His teaching career was punctuated by two extended study-tours of Europe, during which Longfellow made himself fluent in all the major Romance and Germanic languages. Thanks to a fortunate marriage and the growing popularity of his work, from his mid-thirties onwards Longfellow, ensconced in a comfortable Cambridge mansion, was able to devote an increasingly large fraction of his energies to the long narrative historical and mythic poems that made him a household word, especially <b>Evangeline</b> (1847), <b>The Song of Hiawatha</b> (1855), <b>The Courtship of Miles Standish</b> (1858), and <b>Tales of a Wayside Inn</b> (1863, 1872, 1873). Versatile as well as prolific, Longfellow also won fame as a writer of short ballads and lyrics, and experimented in the essay, the short story, the novel, and the verse drama. Taken as a whole, Longfellow&#x2019;s writings show a breadth of literary learning, an understanding of western languages and cultures, unmatched by any American writer of his time.Text: Spanish</p><h2>The Flight from the Enchanter</h2><p>A bewitching young man is determined to charm an attractive, unworldly woman</p><p>Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin in 1919 of Anglo-Irish parents.

The embarrassing incidents of treaties made and broken seem without end. Narrator Mark Bramhall can pronounce the extensive vocabulary of American Indian languages, and his voice brings to mind what modern Caucasians might imagine to be the speech patterns of eighteenth-century Native Americans trying to speak English. He shows little emotion or inflection. Since the rambling story never progresses in any particular direction or temporal sequence, it gives Bramhall few of the elements useful to maintain the interest of his listeners.

The Texans refused to surrender for nearly two weeks until almost 2,000 Mexican troops unleashed a final assault. The defenders fought valiantly-for their lives and for a free and independent Texas-but in the end, they were all slaughtered. Their ultimate sacrifice inspired the rallying cry "Remember the Alamo!" and eventual triumph.<br><br>Exhaustively researched, and drawing upon fresh primary sources in U.S. and Mexican archives, THE BLOOD OF HEROES is the definitive account of this epic battle.

And as her memoirs of four decades as a bawdy house operator reveal, Pauline knew exactly what she is talking about. It was as a divorced mother of two young sons-a respectable matron of Bowling Green, Kentucky, who was struggling to make a living during the Depression years by selling hosiery and cosmetics form door to door-that Pauline decided to open a house of prostitution in her home town. Never having been inside such a house, and never having known a prostitute, Pauline spent a hectic weekend in a notorious Tennessee brothel, learning the secrets of the profession of a madam. Bolstered by this &#39;basic training,&#39; she returned to Bowling Green, opened the town&#39;s finest house of ill fame, and started a long and colorful career as the madam of bordellos in Bowling Green, Louisville, and Indiana. Her most notorious house, at 627 Clay St in Bowling Green, was famous for more than 25 years as a plush palace of pleasure, providing all manner of gracious loving for well-heeled customers from all parts of the nation. Pauline&#39;s memoirs provide one of literature&#39;s most intimate revelations of what goes on behind the walls of a whorehouse. As a retired brothel-keeper, Pauline frankly discusses her lifetime in the illicit sex business.

Thus begins a book that takes the reader on a journey of discovery, from the story of Phineas Gage, the famous nineteenth-century case of behavioral change that followed brain damage, to the contemporary recreation of Gage&#39;s brain; and from the doubts of a young neurologist to a testable hypothesis concerning the emotions and their fundamental role in rational human behavior. Drawing on his experiences with neurological patients affected by brain damage (his laboratory is recognized worldwide as the foremost center for the study of such patients), Antonio Damasio shows how the absence of emotion and feeling can break down rationality. In the course of explaining how emotions and feelings contribute to reason and to adaptive social behavior, Damasio also offers a novel perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct sensing of our own body states, a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulations, on the one hand, and consciousness, on the other. Descartes&#39; Error leads us to conclude that human organisms are endowed from the very beginning with a spirited passion for making choices, which the social mind can use to build rational behavior.Antonio R. Damasio, M.D., Ph.D., is the M. W. Van Allen Professor of Neurology and head of the department of neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.

Gross</b> is the James L. and Shirley A. Draper Professor of Early American History at the University of Connecticut. He is the author of <i>Books and Libraries in Thoreau's Concord </i>(1988) and editor of <i>In Debt to Shays: The Bicentennial of an Agrian Rebellion</i> (1993).</p>&nbsp; <b>The Minutemen and Their World</b><br><b>1</b><i><b>&#x201c;Do Not Be Divided for So Small Matters&#x201d;</b></i><b>C</b>ONCORD arrived at its strategic position in 1775 only after a good deal of foot-dragging. While Bostonians fulminated against British policies in the 1760s and early 1770s, the yeomen of Concord were squabbling among themselves in a series of increasingly bitter quarrels that threatened ultimately to divide the town into two warring parties. The local contentions had no relation to the colonial dispute with Britain; that subject came before the town only occasionally until 1774 and elicited only a mild response. Let others warm to arguments over the rights of the colonies and sound the alarm against a corrupt ministry in London and its lackeys at home. Concordians were more concerned over their roads and schools and meetinghouse.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;When the eighteenth-century Yankee reflected on government, he thought first of his town. Through town meetings, he elected his officials, voted his taxes, and provided for the well-ordering of community affairs. The main business of the town concerned roads and bridges, schools, and the poor&#x2014;the staples of local government even today. But the colonial New England town claimed authority over anything that happened within its borders. It hired a minister to preach in the town-built meetinghouse and compelled attendance at his sermons. It controlled public uses of private property, from the location of slaughterhouses and tanneries to the quality of bread sold at market. And it gave equal care to the moral conduct of its inhabitants, as Concord&#x2019;s William Hunt regretfully learned in 1764 when the selectmen took notice of his public tippling and idle &#x201c;Loytring about from House to House Wasteing his time in a Sinfull maner&#x201d; and advised innkeepers to shut their doors to his trade. No issue was in theory exempt from a town&#x2019;s action, even if in practice the provincial government occasionally intervened in local disputes and told the inhabitants how to run their lives.1A remarkably broad segment of the population could join in this exercise of local power. To vote in Massachusetts town elections, one had to be a male, at least twenty-one years old, an inhabitant of a town for the past year, and owner of an estate that would rent for �3:6:8 a year in the local assessors&#x2019; view. In a country town like Concord, most men could meet the property-holding requirement, which was the equivalent of a month&#x2019;s wages for a common laborer. In 1771 seven out of ten Concordians qualified. Those who could not were farmers&#x2019; sons, only recently come of age, and day laborers and servants, dependent on others for their bread. In eighteenth-century Massachusetts, a citizen mattered politically only when his judgment was subject to no one else&#x2019;s whim and untempted by the financial inducements of designing men.2With town government affecting so much of daily life, no New England community could escape political conflict. A road urgently needed by a man at the outskirts was often a wasteful expense to an inhabitant near the center, while one churchgoer&#x2019;s learned preacher was another&#x2019;s prideful sinner on the way to hell. Politics was, as ever, a contest over who got what of a community&#x2019;s scarce resources and whose values would prevail in local life. But provincial Yankees labored under a set of beliefs that made political activity as we know it impossible.Eighteenth-century New Englanders demanded a great deal of their leaders. A magistrate, they held, was not a hired agent but a &#x201c;father&#x201d; to his people. He was raised up to rule as another Moses, a model of wisdom and righteousness, a lover of justice and champion of the people&#x2019;s rights. Like a good father, he was patient and gentle in guiding his subjects, but he could also be stern when necessary. He neither courted popular favor nor consulted private interest. He was ever-solicitous of the common good.3The people of Concord sought such leaders among the well-born and the rich. Democracy and equality played no part in their view of the world. New Englanders believed that society was composed of &#x201c;ranks and degrees,&#x201d; that just as the earth &#x201c;has Mountains and Plains, Hills and Vallies,&#x201d; so &#x201c;there are the Distinctions of Superiours and Inferiours, Rulers and Ruled, publick and private Orders of Men ... .&#x201d; The upper orders were to rule, the lower to follow. To place men of &#x201c;low degree&#x201d; in the council chamber would bring government into contempt. Magistrates must be distinguished men, known and respected by all. All authority&#x2014;political, social, economic, and moral&#x2014;was of a piece.4By aristocratic English standards, Concord&#x2019;s governing class cut a minor figure in the world. A few leaders were country squires like Colonel John Cuming, a Harvard- and Edinburgh-trained doctor who oversaw a 250-acre farm in Concord and speculated in frontier lands in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont. As a young man in his twenties, Cuming had fought in the old colonial wars against the French, in the course of which he received a musket ball in his hip&#x2014;where it remained till his death&#x2014;and was taken captive by Indians, beaten, and removed to Canada. He eventually won over his captors and gained release in a prisoner exchange. He returned home to build an extensive medical practice throughout Middlesex County and to become one of the town&#x2019;s leading men&#x2014;the moderator of no fewer than ninety town meetings, justice of the peace, president-judge of the county Court of General Sessions. Concord often called on him to serve as its ambassador to the world. Cuming practiced the philanthropy his worldly status prescribed. It is said that he never charged for treating patients on the Sabbath. When Harvard Hall burned, he donated &#x201c;two handsome brass branches for the use of the College chapel&#x201d;; in 1771, he was awarded an honorary M.A. At his death in 1788, he left the College �300 sterling to establish a professorship of medicine. Together with other money, the bequest was used to start the Harvard School of Medicine.5But most of Concord&#x2019;s leaders were substantial yeomen and tradesmen with seventy-five to one hundred acres of land&#x2014;twice the holding of the ordinary farmer. And while they engaged in trade more often than most inhabitants, it was business on the scale of Honest John Beatton, parceling out pins for change, and that of farmer-shoemaker Jonas Heywood, who every winter went from house to house in the countryside &#x201c;whipping the cat&#x201d;&#x2014;boarding with his customers while he made and repaired enough shoes to last each family for the season. Still, hard-working, substantial men like Beatton and Heywood did stand out in a largely rural society, and they could afford to spend the typical selectman&#x2019;s four or five years in the public service. In the eyes of their neighbors, such men could rise to the standard of the public service.6Ephraim Wood was another shoemaker-farmer who won the trust of the town. Born in 1733 and bred to his father&#x2019;s trade, Wood was a natural candidate for town leadership: he was the son of a selectman&#x2014;as were nearly half the men Concord chose for this post. But Wood also commanded respect in his own right. At 250 pounds, he was an imposing figure; the calf of his leg was said to measure twenty-four inches around. He had a reputation for &#x201c;a calm, considerate mind and sound judgment,&#x201d; and he so thrived in business that his name became synonymous with success. Once another shoemaker was complaining to a Scotsman about his bad luck and poor trade. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; the Scotsman replied, &#x201c;you have a very poor trade, but Ephraim Wood have a very good trade.&#x201d; In 1771, Wood succeeded Jonas Heywood as selectman and town clerk, and he served in these posts for the next twenty-five years. When he died in 1814, it was said that <br>In him were united those qualities and virtues, which formed a character at once amiable, useful, respectable, and religious. Early in life he engaged in civil and public business, and by a judicious and faithful discharge of duty acquired confidence and reputation with his fellow citizens and the public ... . The rights and liberties of his country were near his heart, and he was a warm and zealous defender of these against all encroachments. He was a true disciple of the great Washington, a friend to &#x2018;liberty with order.&#x2019; ...In domestic life, his disposition and example were highly amiable and worthy. As a Christian, he was devout and humble, sincere and ardent. Having lived the life, he died the death of the righteous.7<br>In the model commonwealth, public recognition flowed naturally to an Ephraim Wood. As he established himself in society and did his turns in a town&#x2019;s burdensome minor offices&#x2014;posts like constable and surveyor of highways&#x2014;men would notice his merits and soon elevate him to community-wide leadership. In Concord, high positions would normally come to a man by his mid-forties; the community desired leaders in their prime, not after retirement from active life. Ideally, a potential leader neither sought nor clung to office; were he to campaign openly, he would simply demonstrate his unfitness for public trust. Once elected, he would continue on the same conscientious course for the public good, heedless of his own popularity, the partial interests of powerful constituents, or the momentary wishes of a majority. Men would listen when he spoke and, whether they agreed or not, respectfully accept his judgments. So long as the magistrate upheld the fundamental liberties and interests of his community, no one questioned his fitness to rule.8The ordinary citizen in this vision of politics had an equally virtuous code of conduct.

A serial killer is abducting children. Each time, he asks the child a series of questions--a wrong answer leads to the child&#39;s murder. It&#39;s no secret that the murderer is a disillusioned lawyer who thinks he can save the world by killing the children of the rich and powerful. Does this even sound believable? Detective Mike Bennett, who has adopted 10 children, is especially sensitive to the case. Bobby Cannavale gives him a deep, sandpapery voice that adds credibility to the search for the missing children. Bennett is aided by Special Agent Emily Parker, who is professionally portrayed by Orlagh Cassidy. John Glover handles a multiplicity of characters--all well done. The only negative is the story itself, especially its weak ending.

But, fortunately, Tom Wolfe was there, notebook in hand, politely declining LSD while Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters fomented revolution, turning America on to a dangerously playful way of thinking as their Day-Glo conveyance, Further, made the most influential bus ride since Rosa Parks's. By taking <i>On the Road</i>'s hero Neal Cassady as his driver on the cross-country revival tour and drawing on his own training as a magician, Kesey made Further into a bully pulpit, and linked the beat epoch with hippiedom. Paul McCartney's <i>Many Years from Now</i> cites Kesey as a key influence on his trippy <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> film. Kesey temporarily renounced his literary magic for the cause of "tootling the multitudes"--making a spectacle of himself--and Prankster Robert Stone had to flee Kesey's wild party to get his life's work done. But in those years, Kesey's life <i>was</i> his work, and Wolfe infinitely multiplied the multitudes who got tootled by writing this major literary-journalistic monument to a resonant pop-culture moment. <p> Kesey's theatrical metamorphosis from the distinguished author of <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> to the abominable shaman of the "Acid Test" soirees that launched The Grateful Dead required Wolfe's Day-Glo prose account to endure (though Kesey's own musings in <i>Demon Box</i> are no slouch either). Even now, Wolfe's book gives what Wolfe clearly got from Kesey: a contact high. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Wolf Rain (Psy-Changeling Trinity)</h2><p><b>The fate of millions of lives hangs in the balance in this new Psy-Changeling Trinity novel from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Nalini Singh...</b><br><br>Kidnapped as a young girl, her psychic powers harnessed by a madman, Memory lives a caged and isolated existence...until she comes face-to-face with a wolf.

Watch. Be vigilant. Do not allow such heartbreak to happen again.</p><p>&#x2014;Letter from Aren Snow, opened in the aftermath of her death in 2059</p><p>Grief hit him with the force of a backhanded punch.</p><p>Alexei stumbled, came to a halt under the driving rain&#x2014;and immediately realized the soul-shredding pain wasn&#x2019;t his. His eyes burned and his throat threatened to clog, but both the man who ran under the rain and the wolf inside him understood that this grief came from the outside.</p><p>Alexei&#x2019;s own grief remained locked up tight in an airless box where it stayed except for cold midnight hours about once a month when he could no longer hold it inside. Those nights, he ran in wolf form, howling up at the cold moon in pure fury and ignoring the wolf song that responded to his.</p><p>His grief was primal, angry and aggressive and stubbornly determined to be a private thing. His packmates didn&#x2019;t know the meaning of private most of the time, but in this, everyone except the toughest, most stubborn wolves held back. Likely because Alexei would growl them right back inside the den. His grief had claws.</p><p>The grief he could sense today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was raw, without shields, naked and defenseless. It was a wounded animal with its paw caught in a cruel trap. A broken creature in a place without light, alone and afraid. A sentient being who had lost all hope.</p><p>Both parts of him strained at the leash to find the grieving one, attempt to assuage their grief. He was a dominant predatory changeling, a deep protectiveness toward weaker packmates built into his blood. This person wasn&#x2019;t pack, wasn&#x2019;t wolf, but his instincts didn&#x2019;t make the distinction when so close to such terrible anguish.</p><p>Alexei had to force himself to pause, think. Such an overwhelming emotional storm, the roar of it thunder in his blood, it could come from only one type of being. An empath. And not just any empath. A powerful empath who was broadcasting on all bands with no thought to who their pain might hit.</p><p>Alexei had only ever met two empaths. The one he knew best had laughed during their meeting and he&#x2019;d felt the ripple of her happiness in the air, but it had been akin to catching a distant scent on the wind. This was a deluge, but there was no attempt to confuse his own senses.</p><p>The E was broadcasting so loudly that he couldn&#x2019;t help but feel their crushing grief, his already battered and bruised heart aching, but he knew the grief wasn&#x2019;t his own. The E wasn&#x2019;t targeting him or making any attempt to hack his mind. The waves of emotion were too uncontrolled and chaotic for that. As a wolf might react at the loss of his mate, throwing back his head and howling his rage and grief up at the sky, uncaring of who else might hear.</p><p>This was no Psy trick or trap.</p><p>Alexei ran in the direction of the torrent of pain.</p><p>Only moments earlier and regardless of his wolf&#x2019;s edgy need to run, he&#x2019;d been considering turning back. The sudden rise in the strength of the wind worried him, and the rain had become a pitiless silver sheet that threatened to turn into shards of ice. Though heavy snow yet shrouded the higher elevations, including thick patches in his current location, it had been cloudy but otherwise fine when he left his pack&#x2019;s central den in California&#x2019;s Sierra Nevada mountains.</p><p>Now, turning back was not an option.</p><p>The fallen pine needles and snowy leaf litter were fleeting touches under his booted feet, the water that ran over him frigid. Tall green firs thickly dusted with white speared into the granite-colored sky at the start of his run toward the E, but five minutes of loping over the landscape with wolfish speed and the forest giants began to feather out in favor of smaller trees.</p><p>Those, too, disappeared not long afterward.</p><p>It could get bitingly cold at this elevation even in the summer months, the mountains less than hospitable to large foliage. But they&#x2019;d had an unseasonal warm snap over the past two weeks. Grass had begun to poke its sharp blades through the snow, and in between the huge shattered rocks that thrust out of the mountain, he spotted tiny rain-bedraggled wildflowers that would raise their hopeful faces to the sun after the storm was past.</p><p>The wind slapped at his skin and the icy rain ran down his back, but he didn&#x2019;t slow, driven to find the empath suffering so terribly that she was threatening to crush his heart.</p><p>She.</p><p>Yes, the &#x201c;taste&#x201d; of the presence he could sense was categorically female. It was as if she were broadcasting part of herself with her pain. As if the slamming waves of emotion held a scent his wolf could catch.</p><p>His heart thundered, his lungs expanding and collapsing in a harsh rhythm. Inside him ran the wolf that was his other half&#x2014;a half without which he could never be whole. Alexei and his wolf, they were one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even when it came to the curse that haunted his family and had taken his brother. Primal wolf and changeling heart, Alexei accepted who he was&#x2014;and the price it demanded.</p><p>He ran on, the hunt in his blood.</p><p>His packmates didn&#x2019;t often wander this way&#x2014;the power substation he&#x2019;d promised to look in on during this run was a half hour to the west and could be approached from multiple other directions. It was possible no one had spent time up here for months, maybe longer.</p><p>In any other part of the pack&#x2019;s territory, such a gap would be highly unusual. SnowDancer as a pack didn&#x2019;t take territorial security lightly&#x2014;but things got complicated in this particular section of their land. When Alexei had mentioned his intended route to his alpha, the other man had narrowed his ice-blue eyes. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been through there in too long.&#x201d; A tension in Hawke&#x2019;s muscles, his jaw working. &#x201c;My wolf&#x2019;s fur always stands up the wrong way there.&#x201d;</p><p>Alexei&#x2019;s claws had pricked the insides of his fingers at the unspoken reference to the nightmarish past. Hawke had been a child of twelve, Alexei barely four when the Psy attempted to savage the pack with cowardice and stealth. A fringe group of scientists had abducted wolf after wolf, then broken their minds and souls beyond repair, the scientists&#x2019; aim to poison the pack from within.</p><p>Hawke&#x2019;s parents hadn&#x2019;t survived.</p><p>His strong, highly trained father had gone missing up here during a routine patrol. Tristan had been found a week later, badly wounded from an apparent fall. No one knew the Psy had twisted his mind until it was far too late and he lay bleeding out on the snow.</p><p>Hawke&#x2019;s gifted artist mother, Aren, had tried to hold on after Tristan&#x2019;s death, but her heart had been broken into so many pieces that she couldn&#x2019;t put it back together again; she&#x2019;d simply gone to sleep one day and never woken up.</p><p>It was hardly surprising that Hawke preferred not to roam here.</p><p>Odd, however, that other packmates avoided it, too. Even pragmatic Elias had shuddered when he ran into Alexei as Alexei was about to leave this afternoon. &#x201c;Area gives me the creeps,&#x201d; the senior soldier had muttered. &#x201c;Can a mountain be haunted? &#x2019;Cause I&#x2019;m pretty sure that particular section is.&#x201d;</p><p>The E&#x2019;s grief was a crushing vice around his heart by this point, nails that threatened to puncture his lungs. Gritting his teeth, he continued on, uncaring of the sharpness of the rain, the danger of the uneven and rocky terrain. He was a wolf. He was a lieutenant. He was a SnowDancer. And this was wolf land.</p><p>The grief reached a screaming crescendo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only to begin to fade as he ran on.</p><p>Halting, he backed up until the pitch grated and scraped and told him he was right beside her.</p><p>Only there was no one within sight or scent. Rain or not, his vision was acute enough that he could see a hell of a long way at this treeless elevation. The only things in his line of sight were patches of snow, exposed juts of rock, the odd area of grass-speckled earth revealed by the recent warm spell, and, over in the distance, a falcon riding the powerful wind.</p><p>A changeling bird. It was too big to be a natural falcon.</p><p>But the falcon was no concern. The WindHaven falcons had an agreement with SnowDancer that permitted them flight paths over SnowDancer land. Plus, the falcon was far distant and heading in the opposite direction, nearly a dot by now, yet the pain, the pain, it continued to rise and rise and rise.</p><p>Her heart, it was breaking.</p><p>His wolf clawed at the inside of his skin. The primal urge rippling through his blood, Alexei&#x2019;s human hands sprouted claws as he began to hunt among the nearby rocks, on the impossible chance that she was curled up hiding behind one. Impossible because there weren&#x2019;t many rocks large enough. And because how could she be here? This area was so deep in SnowDancer territory that you&#x2019;d have to be a teleporter to get in without being spotted.</p><p>A teleport-capable empath?</p><p>Alexei had never heard of that combination of psychic abilities, but that didn&#x2019;t mean it couldn&#x2019;t exist. There was a lot changelings and humans didn&#x2019;t know about the Psy. The psychic race had kept a wall of cold Silence between themselves and the rest of the world for over a hundred years.</p><p>The protocol that had stifled emotion among the Psy race had also severed their bonds with those outside the PsyNet, the sprawling psychic network that connected all Psy on the planet but for the defectors and renegades. For more than a century, the Psy had focused on icy perfection. They had regarded the other races as lesser, as primitive beings driven by basic animal urges.</p><p>Things had changed in recent times, and Alexei&#x2019;s alpha was mated to a deadly cardinal Psy, while one of Alexei&#x2019;s closest friends was a telekinetic former assassin. But even his Psy packmates and friends didn&#x2019;t know all of their race&#x2019;s secrets&#x2014;Psy leaders had kept the truth from their own people, too. Hidden monsters and predators and psychopaths.</p><p>For it was only the pathologically emotionless who&#x2019;d truly thrived under Silence.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>He growled deep inside his chest, his wolf rising to the surface to alter his vision. Had anyone been looking at him, they&#x2019;d have seen his gray eyes turn a shockingly pale amber shot through with shards of gold, his pupils pinpricks of black.</p><p>The effect was startling because of his dark eyelashes and eyebrows&#x2014;quite unlike the &#x201c;sun-gold&#x201d; of his hair&#x2014;as described by his aunt. Even wet, it didn&#x2019;t darken much. Thank God the color didn&#x2019;t translate into his wolf&#x2019;s pelt; his packmates would&#x2019;ve never let him live down being a fucking yellow wolf.</p><p>Agony, such agony.</p><p>Clenching his jaw, he tried to pick up any scent that denoted a living being. He caught hints of a small woodland creature and of a wild bird, but that was it. Only sodden vegetation, snow, and rock.</p><p>Hauling himself over a large jut of rock as the rain became a raging waterfall, he dropped down into an easy crouch on the other side. He found nothing but a thick pile of snow protected by the shadow the rock would throw in sunlight. Glancing absently back at the rock he&#x2019;d scaled, he stilled at the sight of the jagged crack in the stone. Once, as a pup, Alexei&#x2019;s brother had found a small cave behind a crack just like that one and turned it into their secret hiding spot.</p><p>Brodie had always been generous with his kid brother. Maybe because he&#x2019;d somehow known that, in the end, it would come down to the two of them. Except it hadn&#x2019;t worked out that way.</p><p>Could the empath be curled up in there?</p><p>He took extreme care as he went to explore the possibility. That he still couldn&#x2019;t scent even a hint of her told him his search was apt to be futile, because as far as he was aware, no one had yet discovered a way to cloak their scent from changeling noses. The closest people had come was to soak themselves in a scent that echoed their surroundings, but rain and wet was too subtle a scent to be counterfeited.</p><p>Far more likely was interference by the raging wind, the scents ripped away before he could catch them. Not that it applied to the cracked rock&#x2014;this close, there was no way he&#x2019;d have missed anyone.</p><p>The gap in the stone was barely large enough for his body, even though he turned himself sideways. He knew before he entered that there was no living creature directly beyond. The only smells he&#x2019;d caught had been of cold and dirt.</p><p>Cold had a scent; any wolf could tell you that.</p><p>Snow cold was different from dirt cold. And dirt cold was different from night cold.</p><p>Grumbling silently in disgust when a lump of snow fell on his face from some ledge it had been hiding on, he wiped it off before managing to squeeze through the narrow opening. His eyes adjusted quickly, his night vision kicking in. The space inside the cracked stone was nothing much; if he tried to spread out his arms, he&#x2019;d have to stop with his elbows bent at ninety-degree angles. The area wasn&#x2019;t much deeper, either&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there, in the ground.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Alexei crouched down to stare at a depression in the dirt that was oddly square. Water dripped from his body and hair to darken the dirt. No way that was a natural shape, not unless nature had begun walking around with a tape measure and a slide rule.</p><p>Taking care not to make sounds that would carry, he began to push the dirt away using his claws. It was hard, compacted. As if it hadn&#x2019;t been disturbed in years. No question now&#x2014;there had to be a teleporter involved in this somewhere.</p><p>His claws scraped against what felt like iron.</p><p>Slowing down, he worked with grim focus until he uncovered what he&#x2019;d expected: a trapdoor. It was bolted down securely from the outside, the lock twisted in a way that had to have taken telekinesis. Nothing and no one would ever again open that lock. Rust crawled over it, as it did the solid metal hinges on the other end and the thick strips of iron that formed the body of the trapdoor.</p><p>The thing was old, possibly old enough to be from the time that had left SnowDancer badly wounded, many of its strongest lost.</p><p>Grief, rising and falling, rising and falling. Piercing his heart.</p><p>He shook his head to clear it of the empath&#x2019;s overwhelming pain, his wolf snarling inside his chest. Strands of hair fell across his forehead to drip water down his face. He shoved them roughly back. Despite his rage at finding a living being trapped in a fucking hole in the ground, he didn&#x2019;t immediately begin to hunt for a way to open the trapdoor. Instead, he sliced his claws back in and took out his satellite-linked phone.</p><p>The signal was weak, but his message got through. Should anything happen to Alexei, another wolf would find the grieving empath. And if it was a clever trap to capture a wolf, then his packmates would be warned and armed. He also sent a second message telling SnowDancer not to mobilize until he&#x2019;d scoped out the situation&#x2014;no point in more wolves coming out in this ugly weather if there was no lethal threat to the pack.</p><p>A return message lit up the screen as he was examining the hinges on the trapdoor: We don&#x2019;t hear back from you in twenty, we head out.&#x2014;H.</p><p>Putting the phone in a side pocket of his black cargo pants, Alexei focused all his atten...</p></p><h2>The Outlaw Josey Wales</h2><p>After the Union Army slaughters his family and lures his friends into a death trap under the guise of a white flag, Josey Wales wages a personal war against the men responsible, refusing to surrender no matter what the cost. Reissue. Movie tie-in. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Immediately familiar to many as the basis of one of Clint Eastwood&#x2019;s most successful westerns, this reissue in Leisure&#x2019;s Classic Film Collection was published as The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales in 1973. Set around the time of the Civil War, the novel tells the story of a Missouri farmer who, after his family is murdered by Union militia, joins up with a violent group of Confederate guerrilla fighters. After the war, the Union offers an amnesty to the guerrillas, but Wales refuses to sign. Now a wanted man, with a wounded boy to take care of (after a bungled bank robbery), Wales struggles to stay ahead of his pursuers as he leads them on a desperate chase across two states. The author, whose real name was Asa Earl Carter, was the center of some controversy when it was revealed that his 1976 memoir, The Education of Little Tree, was almost entirely fictional. Leaving allegations about his personal life and beliefs aside, this is a first-rate western, a dramatic character study of a man whose anger and hatred threaten to destroy him. --David Pitt</p><h2>Rena&#39;s Promise: A Story of Sisters in Auschwitz</h2><p><b>A new, expanded edition of <i>Rena's Promise</i> went on sale March 17, 2015. Find it listed in the other editions of this title, or search by ISBN: 978-080709313-9.<br></b><br>Sent to Auschwitz on the first Jewish transport, Rena Kornreich survived the Nazi death camps for over three years. While there she was reunited with her sister Danka. Each day became a struggle to fulfill the promise Rena made to her mother when the family was forced to split apart--a promise to take care of her sister. <br><br>One of the few Holocaust memoirs about the lives of women in the camps, <i>Rena's Promise</i> is a compelling story of the fleeting human connections that fostered determination and made survival a possibility. From the bonds between mothers, daughters, and sisters, to the links between prisoners, and even prisoners and guards, <i>Rena's Promise</i> reminds us of the humanity and hope that survives inordinate inhumanity.</p><p>Rena Kornreich Gelissen lives with her husband in Hendersonville, North Carolina. Heather Dune Macadam, a freelance writer, lives in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Gelissen, who was on the first Jewish transport to Auschwitz, describes in this account the constant struggle for survival in the camp. She soon learns there were no guarantees. Rena's motivation came strongly from a promise to her parents to keep her younger sister, Danka, safe. Her account describes the relentless specter of death while at the same time showing how prisoners would risk their lives to smuggle medicine, clothes, and food to other prisoners. Because Rena was an early prisoner in Auschwitz, she describes some of the confusion at the beginning and the realization of what was really happening to the Jewish people. Helpful features of the book include historical notes and a section describing the fate of the people the sisters knew. This memoir captures the horror of Auschwitz in a clear way that helps the reader understand the atrocities perpetrated there.

Furthering the presentation of recent research in biochemistry, cell biology and energy medicine in the Second Edition, this new and greatly expanded edition includes advances in neurophysiology and physics, reconfiguring knowledge of mind and body, from microgenesis to quantum consciousness. A rare book, required reading for national massage therapy certification, that also serves the general reader.</p><p>Deane Juhan was born in 1945 in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, and educated at the University of Colorado (BA), the University of Michigan (MA), and the University of California at Berkeley (three and a half years as a doctoral candidate in English literature specializing in William Blake). In 1973 an experience with bodywork at Esalen Institute in Big Sur led to a sudden change in career. Joining the staff at Esalen as bodyworker and instructor (where he remained until 1990), he saw dramatic improvements in a wide variety of conditions as a result of hands-on work and movement reeducation. This quickened his interest in clinical research, and years of study of the physiology of touch and its concrete effects on development, adaption, skill learning, and healing eventually produced Job&#39;s Body: A Handbook of Bodywork, as well as the essays in his latest book, Touched by the Goddess: the Physical, Psychological, and Spiritual Powers of Bodywork. He is currently a practitioner of the TragerJuhan examines the physiology and psychology of our response to touch, combining excellent illustrations with a detailed but readable technical discussion. Individual sections conclude with his position that through body work, "heightened self-awareness and improved control over conditioned responses" will improve our health and reduce our Job-like suffering. Although Juhan is a professional body worker at Esalen Institute, he does not describe the techniques used and readers will have to test his claims themselves.

In the fall of 1983, when NATO staged a larger than usual series of field exercises that included, uniquely, a practice run-up to a nuclear attack, the Soviet military came very close to launching a defensive first strike on Europe and North America. With Soviet aircraft loaded with nuclear bombs warming up on East German runways, U.S. intelligence organizations finally realized the danger. Then Reagan, out of deep conviction, launched the arms-reduction campaign of his second presidential term and set the stage for his famous 1986 summit meeting with Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, and the breakthroughs that followed.<br><br>Rhodes reveals the early influence of neoconservatives and right-wing figures such as Richard Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and Paul Wolfowitz. We see how Perle in particular sabotaged the Reykjavik meeting by convincing Reagan that mutual nuclear disarmament meant giving up his cherished dream of strategic defense (the Star Wars system). Rhodes&#x2019;s detailed exploration of these and other events constitutes a prehistory of the neoconservatives, demonstrating that the manipulation of government and public opinion with fake intelligence and threat inflation that the administration of George W. Bush has used to justify the current &#x201c;war on terror&#x201d; and the disastrous invasion of Iraq were developed and applied in the Reagan era and even before.<br><br>Drawing on personal interviews with both Soviet and U.S. participants, and on a wealth of new documentation, memoir literature, and oral history that has become available only in the past ten years, Rhodes recounts what actually happened in the final years of the Cold War that led to its dramatic end. The story is new, compelling, and continually surprising&#x2014;a revelatory re-creation of a hugely important era of our recent history.</p><p><i>Richard Rhodes</i> is the author or editor of twenty-two books, including novels, history, journalism, and letters. <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i> won a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, and a National Book Critics Circle Award. <i>Dark Sun</i>, about the development of the hydrogen bomb, was one of three finalists for a Pulitzer Prize in History.

Its fuel assemblies, sealed inside aluminum cassettes at the bottom of a deep, stainless-steel tank full of distilled water, might have sprung a leak. Or something might have spilled in the institute's radiochemistry lab. Dosimeter operators began working their way methodically through the labs and offices and found radiation everywhere. It was in people's hair and clinging to their clothes. It registered two hundred times normal on the air filters. It was near danger levels at the front door.<br><br>The dosimetrists moved outside and discovered it there as well: on the sidewalk, on the grass, on the periwinkle crocuses pushing up through the dark litter of the forest floor. So the institute wasn't the source. An order over the public-address system warned everyone to stay indoors. Someone called the Lithuanian nuclear-power complex at Ignalina, one hundred miles northwest, and radiation was everywhere there too. Chernobyl, in the Ukraine, was farther away, two hundred miles southeast, where four big RBMK* thousand-megawatt reactors were lined up end to end in a building almost a mile long. Hundreds of people worked there, but the phones rang unanswered. Something was wrong at Chernobyl.<br><br>By afternoon, institute chemists had found radioactive iodine in the fallout, which confirmed that a reactor had exploded. For radioactive gas and smoke from Chernobyl to have reached Minsk, the explosion must have occurred sometime during the night. How much radioactivity had been released? How much more would follow? Why had no one warned them?<br><br>Shushkevich, fifty-two, a solid, ample man with a ruddy face and a high, domed forehead fringed with graying brown hair, was friendly and avuncular but shrewdly intelligent. He was vice-provost of the Byelorussian University in Minsk, a liberal humanist in the tradition of Andrey Sakharov. The Soviet Union's change of direction since the death of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985, just thirteen months before, had filled him with hope. Chernenko, an emphysemic general secretary with the soul of a retired file clerk, had served as a placeholder between the reform-minded but ailing former KGB chief Yuri Andropov and his vigorous young heir apparent, Mikhail Gorbachev. At Chernenko's death his private safe had turned up no personal diary or other intimate record, only a large cache of money no one could account for. Good riddance, Shushkevich had thought: "I was the first at the university to put a portrait of Gorbachev on the wall."<br><br>The night of Chernenko's death, Raisa Maksimovna, Mikhail Gorbachev's wife and partner, pacing beside him in the garden of their country house near Moscow, heard him say resolutely, "We just can't go on like this." The next day, 11 March 1985, Gorbachev had been elected general secretary at a meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee. In his acceptance speech immediately after his election he had called for open government and accountability: "I emphasized the need for transparency (<i>glasnost</i>) in the work of Party, Soviet, state and public organizations," he wrote later. He had laid out in detail his other fundamental goal, perestroika&#x2014;economic restructuring, salvaging the nearly moribund Soviet economy&#x2014;at a Central Committee plenum the following month, stressing "the elimination of everything that interferes with development."<br><br>The huge Soviet military-industrial complex, which insinuated itself into every corner of the Soviet economy and consumed at least 40 percent of the state budget, headed his list for cutbacks, and in a letter delivered to President Ronald Reagan on 15 January 1986 he had broached a proposal without precedent across the four dangerous decades of the U.S.-Soviet nuclear-arms race: "A concrete program," as he described it during a press conference in Moscow later that day, ". . . for the complete liquidation of nuclear weapons throughout the world . . . before the end of the present century." Opening to such unprecedented initiative, 1986 had seemed a year of immense possibility. Now a disaster loomed, of consequences yet unknown, and radiation blew north from Chernobyl.<br><br>At 2:30 on Saturday afternoon someone finally called the institute to report an accident at Chernobyl. In the early hours after midnight, Chernobyl Reactor Number Four had run away in four seconds from 7 percent of maximum rated power to about one hundred times maximum rated power, an event called a prompt critical excursion that had flashed the reactor's thousands of gallons of circulating water to high-pressure steam. The graphite core of the massive concrete-encased reactor was an enclosed cylinder forty feet in diameter and twenty-three feet tall, set on end, with blocks of concrete and a water pool beneath it to absorb the fierce radiation its zirconium-clad uranium fuel elements produced, and a two-million-pound, disk-shaped upper biological shield of concrete blocks set over it like a lid to protect workers from radiation exposure. In the same spirit of bravado that had prompted the scientists at Los Alamos during the Second World War to nickname the atomic bomb they were building the "gadget," the men who operated the RBMKs called the upper biological shield the <i>pyatachok</i>, Russian for one of the smallest Soviet coins, the five-kopek piece.** When the water flashed to superheated steam and the reactor's steam pipes started exploding, an eyewitness reported later, the <i>pyatachok</i> "began to bubble and dance."<br><br>Then two explosions in the space of less than four seconds tore open the reactor and blew out the building. The reactor core was sealed within a metal tank filled with a mixture of helium and nitrogen to prevent the graphite moderator&#x2014;four million pounds of pure carbon&#x2014;from burning. The prompt critical excursion had heated the graphite red hot. The first steam explosion lifted the two-million-pound <i>pyatachok</i>. At the same time the steam burst down through the metal tank and penetrated the red-hot graphite. Steam combines ferociously with hot carbon to make carbon monoxide, liberating hydrogen; the second and more powerful explosion combined steam and exploding hydrogen gas, tilted up the <i>pyatachok</i> nearly vertical, shattered the upper half of the reactor core, and blew tons of its red-hot radioactive debris&#x2014;a rubble of highly irradiated uranium-oxide fuel as well as radioactive graphite and zirconium&#x2014;past the <i>pyatachok</i>, through the roof, and half a mile into the air.<br><br>It fell out by size. Big blocks of hot graphite landed on the roofs of Number Four's turbine hall and Reactor Number Three. To lower construction costs, the roofs had been covered with flammable asphalt; the hot graphite set them on fire. Blocks and smaller pieces of graphite landed on the grounds around the building and splashed hissing into the four-mile-long cooling pond that lay between the plant and the Pripyat River. The cooling pond was fed by and drained into the river, which drained in turn into the big reservoir downstream that stored the water supply of the city of Kiev, the Soviet Union's third-largest city, with a population of some 2.5 million people.<br><br>Graphite pieces and soot-like particles scattered across a stand of pines southeast of the complex; several weeks later, when the radiation had killed the trees and their chlorophyll had faded, people started calling the dead stand "the Red Forest." About half the total radioactive fission products jettisoned from the reactor fell within a two-mile radius of the building. The gases released in the explosion diluted and dispersed into the upper atmosphere, but the wind carried the finest aerosols and hot, intensely radioactive particles (which lofted on their own heat like microscopic hot-air balloons) northwest toward Minsk, on to Ingalina and then across the Baltic Sea to Finland and Sweden. The explosions also blew out the shield elements below the reactor; with the water channels through the graphite blocks drained, the hot graphite chimneyed air up the channels through the remaining lower half of the reactor core and the graphite began to burn. It burned efficiently, the soot and ash carrying more and more radiation high into the air.<br><br>A containment structure such as the concrete-and-steel dome that protects all Western and Japanese power reactors would probably have confined the Chernobyl explosions and their radioactivity, but Soviet reactors of the RBMK type lacked such containment.<br><br>In the 1950s, when the RBMK design was developed and approved, Soviet industry had not yet mastered the technology necessary to manufacture steel pressure vessels capacious enough to surround such large reactor cores. For that reason, among others, scientists, engineers, and managers in the Soviet nuclear-power industry had pretended for years that a loss-of-coolant accident was unlikely to the point of impossibility in an RBMK. They knew better. The industry had been plagued with disasters and near-disasters since its earliest days. All of them had been covered up, treated as state secrets; information about them was denied not only to the Soviet public but even to the industry's managers and operators. Engineering is based on experience, including operating experience; treating design flaws and accidents as state secrets meant that every other similar nuclear-power station remained vulnerable and unprepared.<br><br>Unknown to the Soviet public and the world, at least thirteen serious power-reactor accidents had occurred in the Soviet Union before the one at Chernobyl. Between 1964 and 1979, for example, repeated fuel-assembly fires plagued Reactor Number One at the Beloyarsk nuclear-power plant east of the Urals near Novos...</p><h2>This Noble Land:: My Vision for America</h2><p>Delving deeper than the newspaer headlines, James Michener--storyteller, historian, teacher, government advisor, traveler, and student of his own and other cultures--gives readers his evaluation of nine fundamental problems facing America, offering insights into how to solve them.

Thompson. Fearlessly, he hurls himself into each assignment, gouges out the truth, then returns with a fresh story no one else on earth could write. From Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine, hippies to himself, Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful '60s and '70s. Thompson is a rebel and an artist, and we are all richer for it.<br>"No other reporter reveals how much we have to fear and loathe, yet does it so hilariously."<br>-- Chicago Tribune</p><p>In addition to being a testament to the undeniably beatifying properties of American excess--literary, political, chemical, you name it--Hunter Thompson is the high priest of the ad hominem attack. Anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his satirical sledgehammer will end up with soup for brains. Still, even Thompson needs a good villain to get properly lathered up; that's why he peaked simultaneously with America's 37th president, Richard Milhous Nixon. Tricky Dick was Thompson's dark-jowled, pale-calved Muse, and with his departure Thompson seemed to lose his place a bit. Swatting flies with a baseball bat. <p> You need look no further for this writer's best: this collection of pieces, first published in 1979, spans all of Thompson's primo era, including short pieces and selections from longer works. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> sports a few articles filed by a pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson, which show flickers of passion but no real fire; the first experiments with the author's drug-fueled brand of journalism at the Kentucky Derby; and finally the gigs that made him an American institution, in Las Vegas and on the 1972 campaign trail.</p><p> Thompson's style is so unique that a reader is tempted to think that he leapt, fully formed, into Gonzohood. However, along with the crazy, careening prose itself, one of the auxiliary pleasures of <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is the map that it gives of Thompson's ascent (or descent, if you prefer) from the workaday hyperbole of sports writing to the hell-blast vigor of his later work. The drugs are, by and large, a distraction--lifestyle points that get in the way of the genuinely perceptive journalism that Thompson created. (But they are there, always, and in quantity.) If you're looking for insight into the underbelly of America, Hunter S. Thompson is your best and only guide, and <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is an excellent place to begin the grim safari. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><b>Hunter S.

Her eyes could barely focus as she tried to make out the alarm clock on the nightstand. It was nearly two in the morning, Wednesday, May 31. When she finally reached the phone, she thought she recognized the voice on the other end as a man identified himself as the Grant County coroner. The same man had called five weeks earlier, telling her that Whitney, her eighteen-year-old daughter, had died in an accident along with three other Taylor University students and a university employee. That call also came late at night. <i>Why would the coroner call me in the middle of the night now?</i> she wondered.</p><p>"The county chaplain is monitoring this call," the coroner told her. Then he asked what struck Colleen as a very strange question. "Are you alone?"</p><p>"What? Yes. I mean no," she said. "Carly, my daughter, is home with me."</p><p>"Would you please ask her to listen in on this conversation?"</p><p>If she hadn't been so asleep, Colleen might have asked why it mattered if she were alone, and why the coroner had called at such an ungodly hour. But she didn't. Her body was awake, but her mind hadn't caught up with it yet. She climbed out of bed, walked across the hall to Carly's room, and woke her up. "I need you to listen in on this call. I'm going downstairs to get the other phone. Don't hang up," Colleen said.</p><p>Carly was sound asleep when her mother threw the cordless phone on her bed. "What? You want me to do what? Why?" Carly asked, but Colleen had already started down the stairs. Half asleep, but already panicking, Carly put the phone to her ear. She listened as her mother asked the man to identify himself again. The moment she heard him say he was the coroner, Carly felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>"We now know," the coroner said, "that the accident survivor in the hospital identified as Laura Van Ryn is not in fact Laura. This fact was confirmed earlier this evening through her dental records."</p><p>Carly listened upstairs while Colleen was downstairs on the main extension. Neither of them said a word, their minds unable to comprehend what they were hearing. Then the coroner dropped his bombshell. "We have reason to believe your daughter may be alive."</p><p>"No. No. That's impossible. We buried her," Colleen said. In her half-awake state, she thought the coroner was saying that Whitney had been alive when she was placed in her casket, meaning the family had buried her alive. The thought horrified her. The coroner quickly clarified what he meant. "We have reason to believe that the girl identified as Laura Van Ryn is, in fact, your daughter Whitney Cerak."</p><p>The moment Carly heard the coroner say that Laura was Whitney, she threw down the phone and stormed down the stairs. "No, no, no!" she screamed. "Hang up the phone, Mom. hang up! I can't believe someone would be so cruel as to pull a prank like this. This is the worst thing I've ever heard of in my life!"</p><p>"What did you say?" Colleen said to the coroner. She could hardly hear his response.</p><p>"Mom, listen to me!" Carly yelled. "There's no way that isn't Laura. Her family and her boyfriend have been right at her side for five weeks. <i>Five weeks!</i> Don't you think they would have noticed if it weren't Laura? A lot of my friends have seen her. Kelly was there! Mom, don't you think <i>my own roommate</i> would have noticed something as obvious as this!? Whitney doesn't look like Laura. Why would someone do this?" She began crying. "Mom, hang up the phone. Hang up, HANG UP!"</p><p>Finally Colleen asked the coroner, "May I call you back? I really need some time to think."</p><p>The coroner seemed taken aback by her question. "Mrs. Cerak, this is a very serious matter. We need you to bring your daughter's dental records to the hospital in Grand Rapids as quickly as possible so that we can make a positive identification."</p><p>"I understand that. What's your number there?"</p><p>"Mrs. Cerak!"</p><p>"May I please have your number?" Colleen's mind could not process what he was telling her; she was in shock. <i>Maybe Carly is right. Maybe this is nothing but a cruel, cruel hoax.</i> Once Colleen had the phone number, she hung up the phone and sank into her chair. Carly sat across from her on the sofa, fuming.</p><p>"Who could be so cruel?" Carly asked. Colleen didn't respond. She checked the phone number and discovered that the call had, in fact, come from Marion General Hospital in Indiana, the hospital to which Whitney's body had been taken on the night she died.</p><p>"That doesn't mean the call was real," Carly protested. She looked over at her mother. "Mom, you don't actually believe this garbage, do you?" She threw up her hands in frustration. In her mind, Carly believed she had to be the voice of reason in the family. Her father, a youth pastor, was in New York with a group of high school seniors for their annual graduation trip. With him gone, she kicked into full big-sister mode. "Mom, believe me. I <i>know</i> that the girl in the hospital is Laura, not Whitney. I know what I'm talking about. Who are you going to believe, your own daughter or some stranger making prank calls in the middle of the night!?"</p><p>Colleen didn't know what to do next. She hesitated to call and awaken her husband, Newell, when she didn't yet have any firm information. Going on this trip had been a hard enough decision for him. It was his first step toward something approaching normalcy in his job since they'd lost Whitney five weeks earlier. If this was in fact a hoax, Colleen saw no reason to make him suffer through it as well. Unsure of where else to turn, she called Newell's best friend and coworker, Pastor Jim Mathis, who had walked with the family through the tragedy of Whitney's death. "Jim, we have a situation here," she said, "and I don't know where else to turn. We just received a phone call..."</p><p>"A fake phone call!" Carly shouted in the background.</p><p>"We just received a phone call from someone claiming to be the Grant County coroner. He said..." -- Colleen could hardly believe the words were coming out of her mouth -- "he said that Whitney may be alive."</p><p>"What?" Jim said. "How?"</p><p>"I don't know. I don't even know if the call was real. Would you check it out for me? I don't think I can."</p><p>"Sure. What's the number?"</p><p>Five minutes later he called back and said, "It looks like we need to go on another road trip."</p><p>As soon as she hung up the phone, Colleen called the family dentist for Whitney's dental records, which he said he would bring over right away. Only then did she call her husband. The moment Colleen said his name, Newell knew something was wrong. "Not Carly," he said. "Please tell me that it's not Carly." With Whitney gone, he couldn't bear the thought of something happening to their only surviving daughter.</p><p>"No, no, no. Carly's fine. It's uh...it's about Whitney."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I just got a call from the Grant County coroner's office, and they think...they think Whitney may be alive."</p><p>"That's impossible," he said. "We buried her. She can't be alive."</p><p>"Let me talk to him," Carly yelled in the background and then grabbed the phone out of her mother's hand. "Don't believe any of this, Dad. The phone call said they think Laura is Whitney, but she can't be. My friends saw her. They know Whitney. Believe me, Dad, this is impossible!"</p><p>"I know, Carly. I know" was all he could say in response.</p><p>Colleen got back on the line. "Jim is going to drive us down to Grand Rapids so we can hand over Whitney's dental records to the hospital. I'm sure it's nothing but a wild-goose chase, but we have to go."</p><p>"Be sure to call me as soon as you get there," Newell said. Then he hung up the phone and tried to sleep, to no avail. His mind spun out of control as he lay in the dark. He replayed all that had happened since Colleen had first called him on April 26, 2006, and told him that Whitney had been in an accident. He had been away on a ministry-related trip that night as well. Since then he'd carried a hole in his soul that could not be filled. Yet it wasn't a grief without hope. He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Whitney was in the very presence of God in heaven. Yet now the family was told she was not in heaven, but alive in a hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan. "Unbelievable," he repeated over and over.</p><p>As he tossed and turned in his bed, one thought raced through his mind: <i>How can this even be possible?</i> If a mistake had been made, someone would have noticed in the first couple of days. But five weeks? <i>Five weeks?!</i> Impossible. How could the Van Ryns not have realized this girl wasn't their daughter? She must be horribly disfigured, since it wasn't just the immediate family who would have to be mistaken. Her boyfriend and all of Laura's closest friends had also visited her in the hospital, and not one of them had alerted authorities that there might be a mistake. How could no one have noticed they had misidentified the person in that bed?</p><p>Neither he nor Colleen had seen Whitney's body after the accident. It had made sense at the time, but now a wave of self-doubt washed over him. <i>We didn't want the image of Whit lying in a casket burned in our minds, he reminded himself. Colleen and I agreed that we didn't want that to be the first thing we thought of when we thought about her.</i> Not once had they questioned their decision. Now, for the first time, Newell wondered how the authorities had identified the bodies at the scene of the accident. That opened the door for the biggest question of all: Could Whitney really be alive?</p><p>While Newell tossed and turned in bed at a campground in New Jersey, the rest of the family got ready for what Carly later called "the worst car trip of my life." Colleen told her, "You should pack some clothes to take with us. If this really is Whitney, we'll probably stay down there for a while."</p><p>Carly shot her mother a look. "Would you be realistic, Mother? I told you. My friends have been down there. They've seen her. They all know it's Laura. If it were Whitney, don't you think Laura's <i>best friends</i> would have noticed?"</p><p>"Carly, please, we just have to make su...</p></p><h2>History of Philosophy, Vol. 6: From the French Enlightenment to Kant (Modern Philosophy)</h2><p>Conceived originally as a serious presentation of the development of philosophy for Catholic seminary students, Frederick Copleston's nine-volume <i>A History Of Philosophy</i> has journeyed far beyond the modest purpose of its author to universal acclaim as the best history of philosophy in English.<br>Copleston, an Oxford Jesuit of immense erudition who once tangled with A.J. Ayer in a fabled debate about the exiatenceof God and the possibility of metaphysics, knew that seminary students were fed a woefully inadequate diet of theses and proofs, and that their familiarity with most of history's great thinkers was reduced to simplistic caricatures. Copelston sets out to redress the wrong by writing a complete history of Western philosophy, one crackling with incident and intellectual excitement - and one that gives full place to each thinker, presenting his thought in a beautifully rounded manner and showing his links to those who went before and to those who came after them.</p><p>Frederick Copleston grew up in England. He was raised in an Anglican home but converted to Catholicism while a student at Marlborough College. He later became a Jesuit and then pursued a career in academia. He studied and lectured at Heythrop College and wrote an eleven-volume <i>History of Philosophy</i>, which is highly respected. He also spent time teaching at Gregorian University in Rome and, after he retired, lectured at Santa Clara University in California. He was appointed a member of the British Academy in 1970. He is famouse for debating Betrand Russell over the existence of God in a 1948 BBC broadcast.</p><h2>Barbara W. Tuchman: The Guns of August &amp; The Proud Tower (Library of America)</h2><p>Writing with a clarity, grace, and novelistic sweep rare among historians, Barbara W. Tuchman (1912-1989) distilled the complex interplay of personalities and events into gripping narratives that fuse rigorous scholarship with elegant literary art. An astute portraitist, she brilliantly laid bare the all-too-human failures of leaders subject to the pull of historical currents and prone, often tragically, to the ingrained biases of culture and temperament. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller <i>The Guns of August</i> (1962) offers a majestic orchestration of the diplomatic and military history of the crucial first weeks of World War I. Tuchman's observations about the irrational escalation of conflict made a deep impression on President John F. Kennedy and influenced his actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis; fifty years later, <i>The Guns of August</i> remains an exemplary study of events propelled headlong by their own internal logic and momentum. Some of Tuchman's finest writing is contained in her following book, <i>The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World</i> before the War, 1890-1914 (1966), a fascinating kaleidoscope of eight precisely drawn essays on subjects ranging from international socialism and anarchism to the Dreyfus Affair in France and the birth of American imperialism that collectively set the stage for the cataclysm of 1914. Presented in one volume for the first time and released to mark Tuchman's centennial year and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <i>The Guns of August</i>, here is a vivid, indelible panorama of an epoch in transition.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Crossing the Line conveys the realities of a sailor&#39;s life on a wartime carrier, relating the inveterate routines along with the moments of sheer terror that mobilized boys into fighting men. Kernan writes with unerring honesty of the enlisted man&#39;s struggle to survive with honor; the poor equipment, faulty tactics, and petty rules; the loneliness as well as the congenial interludes with crew mates; the escape sought in barroom brawls and brothels during liberty.</p><p>Alvin Kernan, seeing no prospects in his native Wyoming, enlisted in the U.S. Navy in the spring of 1941. As a seaman on the U.S.S. <i>Enterprise</i>, he saw the destruction and smelled the fires still burning as the aircraft carrier returned to Pearl Harbor from maneuvers on the day after Japan's surprise attack. Years later he would see and smell much the same thing in Japanese harbors. In the time between, Kernan had some exceptional adventures, which are chronicled in <i>Crossing the Line</i>. This reflective memoir is utterly unpretentious in providing an engaging view of ordinary Americans at war. Leaving the grand historical themes for other writers, Kernan tells us what it was really like for the sailors in the fleet, during fierce combat as well as during some lively recreation.Alvin Kernan is Senior Advisor in the Humanities and Director of the Graduate Fellowship Program at the Andrew W.

Hiero&#39;s task was to bring back a lost secret of the ancients that might save the humans.

It doesn't matter if you're a Hollywood movie star, or a Washington insider, or Joe Blow from Massapequa--when you come up against O'Reilly, you better get your story straight. <br><br>Here, for the first time on paper, is O'Reilly's take on our country, our politicians, our celebrities, our class system, our love lives, our money. In fact, O'Reilly's got an opinion on just about everything, and he's holding nothing back:<br><br>O'Reilly on class: "A mind is a terrible thing to waste if you're held back by race, or gender. It is just as great a waste when you're held back by class. Right, Reverend Jackson?"<br><br>O'Reilly on Martha Stewart: "While she masquerades as a paragon of good taste, she has turned herself into a snooty, condescending mogul<br>. . . She's a first-rate con artist." <br><br>O'Reilly on money: "The true heroes of America are not the new Internet billionaires or the overpaid sports stars. The true heroes are the men, women, and teenagers who go to work for a modest wage, fulfill their responsibilities, and are kind and generous to others."<br><br>O'Reilly on Al Sharpton and David Duke: "These two are the most ridiculous racial demagogues in the entire U.S.A. If God has a sense of humor, they will be sharing a sauna in the netherworld. With one thermostat."<br><br>O'Reilly on sex: "It's time that we all lighten up about sex and keep our sexual activities where they belong: in the privacy of the bedroom or the hot tub, or in the case of Pamela Anderson, on the Internet."<br><br>Mixing fascinating stories from his life both on- and off-screen with his explosive views on what's up with America, and how we can fix it, <b>The O'Reilly Factor</b> will ruffle your feathers, make you laugh, and make you think.</p><p><i>The O'Reilly Factor</i> isn't just the name of Bill O'Reilly's popular talk show on the Fox News Channel anymore--it's also the title of his book, which, appropriately enough, actually reads like a TV show. The narrative rarely proceeds for more than a few paragraphs before a bold-faced "This Just In" or "Bulletin" pops up on the page and breaks the stream of thought--sort of like a commercial interruption. This provides an ideal forum for O'Reilly to sound off on any number of topics with lots of verve but not too much depth. There are breezy chapters here on money, media, religion, race, and sex, among others. O'Reilly dislikes many things, and he isn't shy about sharing his opinions: "SUVs should be immediately outlawed," he rants. Here's O'Reilly on President Clinton: "What a ridiculous waste!" Attorney General Janet Reno is a "ridiculous, incompetent woman" and President Clinton's "primary 'enabler.'" <p> This is not a subtle book, and its bombastic approach would be even more grating if it weren't for several flashes of self-deprecation, such as when the author shares a negative piece of viewer mail, or when he writes, "In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cocky bastard." Sometimes O'Reilly's put-downs are creative and funny: "If God has a sense of humor, as I believe he does, [Al Sharpton and David Duke] will be sharing a sauna in the netherworld. With one thermostat." And he's good at illustrating his points with outrageous details. In criticizing the bloated federal budget, for instance, he points to these shockers: $230,000 for a study of housefly sex habits, $27,000 for an analysis of why prisoners want to escape, and $100,000 to find out why Americans don't like beets. (To which he replies: "Houseflies mate when no one is looking. Prisoners don't like prison. Beets don't taste good.") O'Reilly is often considered something of a conservative, but he can also play the blue-collar populist: "The rich want us to believe that anyone can make the quantum leap from bowling league to country club by just working a little harder. That's supposed to keep us motivated and quiet." Fans of his TV show will probably appreciate this cantankerous book. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Bill O'Reilly has the hottest cable news program on the air. "The O'Reilly Factor", seen nightly on the Fox News Channel, boosted its ratings by over six times in 1998, and has kept soaring through the 1999 season. His blunt, ironic, no-holds-barred style has earned O'Reilly a devoted audience of viewers -- friends and foes alike -- who send him five thousand letters every week. Now, with the wit and intelligence that have made him one of the most talked-about stars in television, Bill O'Reilly identifies what's right, what's wrong, and what's absurd in the political, social, economic, and cultural life of America: <br>-- The media: why what you see is decided upon by morons<br>-- Politics: why most politicians are obsolete<br>-- Sex: why Americans would declare war on Denmark if they knew what was going on there<p>As the nation prepares for another presidential race, O'Reilly's provocative opinions are sure to add fire to the ongoing debates. The O'Reilly Factor is poised to follow in the footsteps of bestsellers such as Rush Limbaugh's The Way Things Ought to Be and Jesse Ventura's I Ain't Got Time to Bleed.</p></p><h2>A Beautiful Wedding: A Novella (Beautiful Disaster Series)</h2><p>You know that Abby Abernathy unexpectedly became Mrs. Maddox.

The more I tried to ignore it, the more unbearable it became: an itch that needed to be scratched, a scream bubbling to the surface. My father said that the urgent need to run when things were about to go wrong was a like a tic, a defense mechanism inherent in the Abernathys. I&#x2019;d felt it moments before the fire, and I was feeling it now.<br> <br>Sitting in Travis&#x2019;s bedroom, just hours after the fire, my heart raced and my muscles twitched. My gut pulled me toward the door. Told me to leave; to get away, anywhere but here. But for the first time in my life, I didn&#x2019;t want to go alone. I could barely focus on that voice I loved so much describing how afraid he was of losing me, and how he was close to escaping when he ran in the opposite direction, toward me. So many people died, some of them strangers from State but some were people I&#x2019;d seen in the cafeteria, in class, at other fights.<br> <br>We somehow survived and were sitting alone in his apartment, trying to process it all. Feeling afraid, feeling guilty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about those who died, and that we had lived. My lungs felt like they were full of cobwebs and flames, and I couldn&#x2019;t get the rancid smell of charred skin out of my nose. It was overpowering, and even though I&#x2019;d taken a shower, it was still there, mixed in with the mint and lavender scent of the soap I used to scrub it away. Equally unforgettable were the sounds. The sirens, the wailing, the worried and panicked chatter, and the screams of people arriving on the scene to discover that a friend was still inside. Everyone looked the same, covered in soot, with identical expressions of bewilderment and despair. It was a nightmare.<br> <br>Despite my struggle to focus, I did hear him say this: &#x201c;The only thing I&#x2019;m afraid of is a life without you, Pigeon.&#x201d;<br> <br>We had been too lucky. Even in a dark corner of Vegas, being attacked by Benny&#x2019;s goons, we somehow still had the advantage. Travis was invincible. But being a part of the Circle, and helping to organize a fight in unsafe conditions that resulted in the deaths of countless college kids&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was a fight not even Travis Maddox could win. Our relationship had withstood so many things, but Travis was in real danger of going to prison. Even if he didn&#x2019;t know it yet, it was the one obstacle that could keep us apart. The one obstacle that we had no control over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you have nothing to be afraid of,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed, and then pressed his lips against my hair. I didn&#x2019;t think it was possible to feel so much for one person. He had protected me. It was my turn to protect him.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn&#x2019;t something about you at all. It was just you.&#x201d;<br> <br>My insides melted. I loved him. I loved him, and I had to do whatever I could to keep him safe. Whatever it took&#x2014;no matter how crazy. All I had to do was talk him into it.<br> <br>I leaned against him, pressing my cheek against his chest. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s us, Trav. Nothing makes sense unless we&#x2019;re together. Have you noticed that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Noticed? I&#x2019;ve been telling you that all year! It&#x2019;s official. Bimbos, fights, leaving, Parker, Vegas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even fires. Our relationship can withstand anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Vegas?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>In that moment, the most insane plan formed in my mind, but the idea made sense as I stared into his warm, brown eyes. Those eyes made everything make sense. His face and neck were still covered in soot mixed with sweat, a reminder of how close we had come to losing everything.<br> <br>My mind was racing. We would only need necessities and we could be out the door in five minutes. We could buy clothes there. The sooner we left the better. No one would believe two people would get on a plane right after such an enormous tragedy. It didn&#x2019;t make sense, which was exactly why we had to do it.<br> <br>I had to take Travis far enough away, for a specific reason. Something believable, even if it was crazy. Luckily, crazy wasn&#x2019;t that far a leap for Travis and me, and it was possible the investigators would second-guess the dozens of witnesses who saw Travis fighting in the basement of Keaton Hall that night&#x2014;if they had proof that we were in Vegas hours later getting married. It was absolutely insane, but I didn&#x2019;t know what else to do. I didn&#x2019;t have time to come up with a better plan. We should already be gone.<br> <br>Travis was staring back at me expectantly, waiting to unconditionally accept whatever came out of my crazy mouth. Goddammit, I couldn&#x2019;t lose him now, not after everything we&#x2019;d fought through to get to this moment. By anyone&#x2019;s standards, we were too young to get married, too unpredictable. How many times had we hurt one another along the way, screamed at each other one minute and fallen into bed together the next? But we&#x2019;d just seen how fragile life was. Who knew when the end would come along and sweep one of us away? I looked at him, resolute. He was mine, and I was his. If I knew anything at all, it was that only those two things mattered.<br> <br>He furrowed his brow. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you thought about going back?&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyebrows shot up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Weeks ago, I&#x2019;d broken his heart. Travis chasing America&#x2019;s car when he realized it was over was still fresh in my mind. He was going to fight for Benny in Vegas, and I wouldn&#x2019;t go back there. Not even for him. He had gone through hell while we were apart. He&#x2019;d begged me back on his knees, and I was so set on never returning to my life in Nevada, I&#x2019;d walked away. I&#x2019;d be a complete asshole if I asked him to go back. I half expected him to tell me to get the hell out for even mentioning it, but this was the only plan I had, and I was desperate.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if we just went for a night?&#x201d; A night was all I needed. We just needed to be somewhere else.<br> <br>He looked around his bedroom, searching the darkness for what he thought I wanted to hear. I didn&#x2019;t want to be that girl, the one who wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming and caused a huge, stupid misunderstanding. But I couldn&#x2019;t tell Travis the truth about what I&#x2019;d just proposed to him. He would never agree to go.<br> <br>&#x201c;A night?&#x201d; He clearly had no clue how to respond. He probably thought it was a test, but the only thing I wanted was for him to say yes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marry me,&#x201d; I blurted out.<br> <br>His mouth parted, forming a silent gasp. I waited lifetimes until his lips curved upward, and he sealed his mouth on mine. His kiss screamed a thousand different emotions. My brain felt swollen with warring thoughts of relief and panic. This was going to work. We would get married, Travis would have an alibi, and everything would be okay.<br> <br>Oh, hell.<br> <br>Damn. Shit. Fuck.<br> <br>I was getting married.<br> Travis<p></p> <br>Abby Abernathy was famous for one thing: having no Tell. She could commit a crime and smile like it was any other day, lie without a twitch in her eye. Only one person in the world had any chance of learning her Tell, and that one person had to figure it out if he wanted to have any chance with her.<br> <br>Me.<br> <br>Abby had lost her childhood, and I&#x2019;d lost my mom, so for two people who struggled to get on the same page, we were the same story. That gave me an edge, and after making this my goal over the past months, I&#x2019;d arrived at an answer:<br> <br>Abby&#x2019;s Tell was not having one. It might not make sense to most people, but it made perfect sense to me. It was the absence of that Tell that gave her away. The peace in her eyes, the softness in her smile, the relaxation of her shoulders alerted me that something was wrong.<br> <br>If I didn&#x2019;t know her better, I might have thought this was just our happy ending, but she was up to something. Sitting in the terminal, waiting to board a plane to Vegas, with Abby snuggled into the curve of my body, I knew it was easy to try to ignore. She kept lifting her hand, staring at the ring I&#x2019;d bought her, and sighing. The middle-aged woman across from us was watching my new fianc�e and smiled, probably fantasizing about a time when she had her whole life ahead of her. She didn&#x2019;t know what those sighs really meant, but I had an idea.<br> <br>It was hard to be happy about what we were about to do with the cloud of so many deaths hanging above our heads. No, really, it was literally above our heads. A television on the wall displayed the local news. Footage of the fire and the latest updates scrolled across the screen. They interviewed Josh Farney. He was covered in soot and he looked horrible, but I was glad to see he&#x2019;d made it. He was fairly hammered when I saw him before the fight. Most of the people who came to the Circle either came drunk or worked their way up to a buzz while they waited for me and my opponent to trade blows. When the flames began to crawl across the room, adrenaline pumped into everyone&#x2019;s veins&#x2014;enough to sober up even the most intoxicated.<br> <br>I wished it hadn&#x2019;t happened. We&#x2019;d lost so many, and this wasn&#x2019;t exactly something you&#x2019;d want your wedding to follow. From experience, I knew that the memory of a tragedy could be misplaced. Attaching this date to something we would celebrate year after year would keep it front and center in our minds. Damn, they were still bringing out bodies, and I was acting like this was an annoyance. There were parents out there who had no idea they&#x2019;d never see their kids again.<br> <br>That selfish thought led to guilt, and that guilt led to a lie. It was a sheer miracle that we were getting married right now, anyway. But I didn&#x2019;t want Abby thinking I was anything but super fucking pumped about getting married. Knowing her, she&#x2019;d misread it and then change her mind. So I focused on her, and what we were about to do. I wanted to be a normal, so-excited-I-might-puke groom-to-be, and she deserved nothing less. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time I&#x2019;d pretended not to care about something I couldn&#x2019;t get out of my head. The living proof was snuggled up next to me.<br> <br>On the television screen, the anchorwoman standing outside Keaton Hall held the microphone with both hands, a frown line between her eyebrows. &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what the families of the victims will be asking: who is to blame? Back to you, Kent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly the nausea became real. So many had died, of course they were going to hold someone accountable. Was it Adam&#x2019;s fault? Would he go to prison? Would I? I hugged Abby to me and kissed her hair. A woman behind a desk picked up a mic and began to speak, and my knee started to bounce uncontrollably. If we weren&#x2019;t going to board soon, I might pick up Abby and run to Vegas. I felt like I could have made it there before the plane. The airline agent instructed us about boarding the flight, her voice rising and falling with the scripted announcement she&#x2019;d probably read a million times. She sounded like the teacher in those Peanuts cartoons: bored, monotone, and impossible to understand.<br> <br>The only thing that made sense were the thoughts on repeat inside my head: I was about to become the husband of the second woman I&#x2019;d ever loved.<br> <br>It was almost time. Damn. Shit, yeah! Fuck, yes!<br> <br>I was getting married!</p><h2>The Great Railroad Revolution: The History of Trains in America</h2><p><p>America was made by the railroads. The opening of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio line&#x2013;&#x2013;the first American railroad&#x2013;&#x2013;in the 1830s sparked a national revolution in the way that people lived thanks to the speed and convenience of train travel. Promoted by visionaries and built through heroic effort, the American railroad network was bigger in every sense than Europe&#x2019;s, and facilitated everything from long-distance travel to commuting and transporting goods to waging war. It united far-flung parts of the country, boosted economic development, and was the catalyst for America&#x2019;s rise to world-power status.</p><p>Every American town, great or small, aspired to be connected to a railroad and by the turn of the century, almost every American lived within easy access of a station. By the early 1900s, the United States was covered in a latticework of more than 200,000 miles of railroad track and a series of magisterial termini, all built and controlled by the biggest corporations in the land. The railroads dominated the American landscape for more than a hundred years but by the middle of the twentieth century, the automobile, the truck, and the airplane had eclipsed the railroads and the nation started to forget them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Great Railroad Revolution</i>, renowned railroad expert Christian Wolmar tells the extraordinary story of the rise and the fall of the greatest of all American endeavors, and argues that the time has come for America to reclaim and celebrate its often-overlooked rail heritage.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Christian Wolmar</b> is a writer and broadcaster, specializing in transportation matters.

So America, from 1830 on, from a few, tentative miles of track to a quarter of a million miles only 80 years later, is a story that grips his imagination... the tangle of failure, frailty and faint-heartedness he unpicks here goes far beyond mere romance: it resonates and crosses borders of national experience; it tells us something vital about the nature of railways we still struggle to learn to this day...

Neil McCormick is fully aware of the events from the summer. Wise beyond his years, curios about his developing sexuality, Neil found what he perceived to be love and guidance from his baseball coach. Now, ten years later, he is a teenage hustler, a terrorist of sorts, unaware of the dangerous path his life is taking. His recklessness is governed by idealized memories of his coach, that unexpectedly change when brian comes to Neil for help and, ultimately, the truth.</p></p><p>Scott Heim's fiction and poetry have appeared in many literary magazines and anthologies, including the upcoming <i>Best American Gay Fiction.</i> One of the picks in <i>The New York Times Magazine's </i> feature of "Thirty Artists Under Thirty to Watch," he holds degrees from the University of Kansas and Columbia University and lives in New York City."The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life"?so runs the catchy opening to Heim's impressive first novel. The speaker is Brian Lackey, now a troubled teenager, once an introverted kid growing up scared in the small town of Hutchinson, Kans. The reason for his memory lapse and his fear, as we and Brian learn during the course of the novel, turns out not to be the space aliens that he first suspects, but his molestation at the hands of his Little League coach. The key to Brian's reclamation of those lost hours is homosexual hustler Neil McCormick?the slugger on that Little League team and an accomplice to Brian's sexual abuse. Working its way over the course of a decade toward Brian and Neil's reunion, the narrative unfolds through chapters whose points of view alternate among Brian, Neil and a handful of their siblings and confidants. Heim makes numerous freshman mistakes, including a relatively static narrative, prominent characters who outlive their usefulness and occasional lapses in the writing. He also creates scenes of genuine beauty, however, and handles his complicated characters and delicate subject matter with calm assurance. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sketches by Boz (The Oxford Illustrated Dickens)</h2><p>Reproductions of the original drawings support Dickens&#39; commentaries on social changes in Victorian England</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

The citizens of Gander met the stranded passengers with an overwhelming display of friendship and goodwill. </p><p>As the passengers stepped from the airplanes, exhausted, hungry and distraught after being held on board for nearly 24 hours while security checked all of the baggage, they were greeted with a feast prepared by the townspeople. Local bus drivers who had been on strike came off the picket lines to transport the passengers to the various shelters set up in local schools and churches. Linens and toiletries were bought and donated. A middle school provided showers, as well as access to computers, email, and televisions, allowing the passengers to stay in touch with family and follow the news.</p><p>Over the course of those four days, many of the passengers developed friendships with Gander residents that they expect to last a lifetime. As a show of thanks, scholarship funds for the children of Gander have been formed and donations have been made to provide new computers for the schools. This book recounts the inspiring story of the residents of Gander, Canada, whose acts of kindness have touched the lives of thousands of people and been an example of humanity and goodwill.</p></p><p>The events of September 11 have seemingly been covered, analyzed, and discussed from every angle imaginable. So the subject matter alone of Jim DeFede's <i>The Day the World Came to Town</i> makes it noteworthy. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 38 commercial airliners carrying over 6,000 passengers were forced, as a precautionary measure, to land in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Due to the ongoing closure of U.S. airspace, the passengers spent four days in this isolated town of 10,000 before being allowed to continue on their way. In that time, Gander's residents rallied together to extend a kind of hospitality that seems too expansive for the word <i>hospitality</i>. Townspeople not only opened schools and legion halls for use as emergency shelters, they invited the passengers into their homes for showers, meals, and warm beds while local businesses simply gave toiletries and clothing to passengers stuck without luggage. Despite the grim consequences that led to the situation, DeFede finds humor: two flight attendants are offered a car for sightseeing by a local woman who happened to be driving by; the stranded chairman of Hugo Boss finds himself shopping for men's underwear at the local Wal-Mart. But the real message of the book is how, even in times of great turmoil and conflict, people can and must look to one another for comfort, help, and hope. <i>--John Moe</i><p><em>"For the better part of a week, nearly every man, woman, and child in Gander and the surrounding smaller towns stopped what they were doing so they could help. They placed their lives on hold for a group of strangers and asked for nothing in return. They affirmed the basic goodness of man at a time when it was easy to doubt such humanity still existed."</em></p><p>When thirty-eight jetliners bound for the United States were forced to land in Gander, Newfoundland, on September 11, 2001, due to the closing of United States airspace, the citizens of this small community were called upon to come to the aid of more than six thousand displaced travelers.</p><p>Roxanne and Clarke Loper were excited to be on their way home from a lengthy and exhausting trip to Kazakhstan, where they had adopted a daughter, when their plane suddenly changed course and they found themselves in Newfoundland. Hannah and Dennis O'Rourke, who had been on vacation in Ireland, were forced to receive updates by telephone on the search for their son Kevin, who was among the firefighters missing at the World Trade Center. George Vitale, a New York state trooper and head of the governor's security detail in New York City who was returning from a trip to Dublin, struggled to locate his sister Patty, who worked in the Twin Towers. A family of Russian immigrants, on their way to the Seattle area to begin a new life, dealt with the uncertainty of conditions in their future home.</p><p>The people of Gander were asked to aid and care for these distraught travelers, as well as for thousands more, and their response was truly extraordinary. Oz Fudge, the town constable, searched all over Gander for a flight-crew member so that he could give her a hug as a favor to her sister, a fellow law enforcement officer who managed to reach him by phone. Eithne Smith, an elementary-school teacher, helped the passengers staying at her school put together letters to family members all over the world, which she then faxed. Bonnie Harris, Vi Tucker, and Linda Humby, members of a local animal protection agency, crawled into the jets' cargo holds to feed and care for all of the animals on the flights. Hundreds of people put their names on a list to take passengers into their homes and give them a chance to get cleaned up and relax.</p><p><em>The Day the World Came to Town</em> is a positively heartwarming account of the citizens of Gander and its surrounding communities and the unexpected guests who were welcomed with exemplary kindness.</p></p><h2>Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War</h2><p><p><i><b>WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE</b></i></p><p><i><b>I</b></i><i><b>n a time of death and terror, Leymah Gbowee brought Liberia&#x2019;s women together&#x2014;and together they led a nation to peace.</b></i></p><p>As a young woman, Leymah Gbowee was broken by the Liberian civil war, a brutal conflict that tore apart her life and claimed the lives of countless relatives and friends.

Douglas Fields, PhD, reveals in this essential book for our time. &nbsp;The daily headlines are filled with examples of otherwise rational people with no history of violence or mental illness suddenly snapping in a domestic dispute, an altercation with police, or road rage attack. We all wish to believe that we are in control of our actions, but the fact is, in certain circumstances we are not.&nbsp;The sad truth is that the right trigger in the right circumstance can unleash a fit of rage in almost anyone. <br><br>But there is a twist: Essentially the same pathway in the brain that can result in a violent outburst can also enable us to act heroically and altruistically before our conscious brain knows what we are doing. Think of the stranger who dives into a frigid winter lake to save a drowning child.<br><br>Dr. Fields is an internationally recognized neurobiologist and authority on the brain and the cellular mechanisms of memory. He has spent years trying to understand the biological basis of rage and anomalous violence, and he has concluded that our culture&#x2019;s understanding of the problem is based on an erroneous assumption: that rage attacks are the product of morally or mentally defective individuals, rather than a capacity that we all possess.&nbsp;<br><br>Fields shows that violent behavior is the result of the clash between our evolutionary hardwiring and triggers in our contemporary world. Our personal space is more crowded than ever, we get less sleep, and we just aren't as fit as our ancestors. We need to understand how the hardwiring works and how to recognize the nine triggers. With a totally new perspective, engaging narrative, and practical advice, <i>Why We Snap</i> uncovers the biological roots of the rage response and how we can protect ourselves&#x2014;and others.</p><p><b>R.

Why smash a treasured vase? Why slap a lover across the face? The immediate aftermath brings regret and shame, and upon reflection bewilderment. The explosive impulse of destruction is driven by a powerful righteous rage, overwhelming but pointless.</p><p>Who has not lost self-control in a blind rage, smashing a dish&#x2014;or worse? We all wish to believe&#x2014;need to believe&#x2014;that we are in control of our behaviors and actions, but the fact is that in certain instances we are not. Something unexpected in our environment can unleash an automatic and complex program for violence, destruction, and even death&#x2014;all of it an unconscious pre-established program.</p><p>Rage explodes without warning. Overpowering judgment, compassion, fear, and pain, the fiery emotion serves one purpose&#x2014;violence, both in words and actions. While this human response has been vital to our survival since our species evolved, rage simultaneously puts one&#x2019;s life at risk. And it seems there is no escaping the rage circuit once it has been activated. So if rage is an automatic reflex, are you really in control of your fate? That flare-up with your partner or child or friend or even a complete stranger can change your life in an instant, forever.</p><p>Despite the essentially peaceful lives most of us lead most of the time, killing is programmed into the human brain. This is because, as with most animals, individuals in the natural world must be able to defend themselves and their offspring. Moreover, carnivores must kill other living creatures for food. These behaviors are hardwired in the brain, not in an area where consciousness resides but instead deep in the core of the brain where other powerful impulses and automatic life-sustaining behaviors (feeding, thirst, and sex) are programmed. Each of these behaviors, just like the complex rage behavior, is automatic once triggered. The question is, what triggers this deadly switch for violence and killing?</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Late one summer night in a torrential downpour, my daughter and I threaded our way through the dark cobblestone back alleys of Paris, hungry and lost. Like most scientists, I travel the world to lecture and collaborate with other scientists, and I almost always travel alone. This night my seventeen-year-old daughter was with me. The springtime of proms, graduation ceremonies, and anxious anticipation of leaving high school behind had cleared a momentary opportunity for a father and daughter to share time together. It was wonderful seeing Kelly&#x2019;s eyes open to the world. Soaking wet, we leaped over puddles and escaped into a steamy one-room restaurant. No one spoke English. Kelly applied her high school French to order from one of the three frantic middle-aged women who shared the burden of all the cooking and serving.</p><p>Suddenly in exasperation the woman jabbed at the menu, scolding Kelly. She had not ordered a glass of wine for herself. The idea that anyone would enjoy a fine dinner without the requisite glass of wine was unthinkable. For Kelly, underage for drinking alcohol in the United States, this was a revelation. Not everywhere in the world is necessarily the same as the place in which you were reared.</p><p>After Paris we traveled to Barcelona for my next lecture at an international meeting of neuroscientists. The morning before the meeting began we made a quick visit to the Gaudi cathedral. Ascending the steps out of the dingy subway station smelling of concrete dust and sweat, we emerged into the brilliant Barcelona sun. The crowd of passengers pressed upon us in a gray blur.</p><p>Suddenly I felt a sharp tug at my pant leg. As if swatting a mosquito I slapped the zippered pocket above my left knee. My wallet was gone!</p><p>My left arm shot back blindly. In a flash I clotheslined the robber as he pivoted to hand my wallet to his partner and flee down the steps. As if swinging a sledgehammer I hurled him by his neck over my left hip and slammed him belly first onto the pavement, where I flattened him to the ground and applied a head lock.</p><p>Splaying my legs for hip control like a wrestler pinning an opponent I yelled for help. Fifty-six years old, 130 pounds, with wire-rimmed glasses and graying hair, I have no martial-arts training, no military experience, no background in street fighting. Drawing on junior high school wrestling moves from forty years ago, I found myself applying an illegal choke hold. The street-smart hoodlum struggling in my arms was in his late twenties or early thirties.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Call the police! I&#x2019;ve got him!&#x201d;</p><p>There was no reply&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no gasps of shock from the dense crowd&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no one was coming to my aid. Instead, from my perspective on the ground all I saw were men&#x2019;s feet closing in around me in a tight circle. They were all part of the gang. Oblivious to being hunted as prey, we assumed that the crowd was the normal throng of passengers bumping and jostling through the Barcelona Metro system.</p><p>The muscled man beneath me struggled to break my grip. With his neck in the crook of my left arm I cinched with all the force my biceps could produce, cutting off blood to his brain and air to his lungs. Bending his head back I torqued his spine backward painfully, tipping his face skyward. His eyes and mouth opened wide in shock, pain, and fear. The wallet popped free as he tossed it toward his accomplice and grasped furiously at my arm to break my stranglehold.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my wallet!&#x201d; I yelled.</p><p>A woman&#x2019;s hand shot between the thicket of legs. Instantly I recognized it as my daughter&#x2019;s. She had been cut off by the gang that had stalked and trapped us, encircling me silently like a pack of wolves. Captain of the Ultimate Frisbee team, Kelly dove through the air in an arc to deflect the disk inches from an opponent&#x2019;s grasp in a full-on layout onto solid concrete. She intercepted the pass in midair and tipped the wallet into the palm of my outstretched right hand. Reading the eyes of an accomplice fixating on my BlackBerry spinning on the pavement, she lunged again and beat him to the prize.</p><p>With my wallet retrieved and realizing that I was horribly outnumbered, I released the thief and bounced onto the balls of my feet as he scurried backward on his butt like an injured crab escaping. &#x201c;Crazy man!&#x201d; he gasped.</p><p>Looking into the eyes of the half-dozen muscular thugs surrounding me, I tried to discern if he choked out those parting words to deflect suspicion or if he meant it as a threat.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>A massive surge of adrenaline fueled my twitching muscles and nerves to levels of raw power I had never felt before. I was now struggling not to pick up the next hoodlum squaring off with me, hoist him over my head, and hurl him into his accomplices, knocking them down the steps of the Metro station like bowling pins. It was not a question of whether I could execute the superhuman feat. I had no doubt that I could do it. Rather, I was trying <i>not</i> to do it, simply because this might not be my best option. At least, not yet.</p><p>Suddenly a middle-aged, well-dressed Spaniard stepped casually between me and the attackers and with flicking shooing motions of his fingers he said, &#x201c;He no crazy&#x2014;go.&#x201d; Without breaking stride he descended the steps into the Metro station. As he passed me he smiled and said, &#x201c;<i>Bueno</i>&#x2014;good&#x2014;go now.&#x201d; In passing he had defused the situation to its best possible outcome: a draw. The band of robbers scattered into the Metro station like rats down a sewer, leaving my daughter and me standing there stunned, my wallet clenched in a death grip in my right hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was not the end of it. The gang pursued Kelly and me throughout the city for the next two hours. They were not after my wallet anymore. I had humiliated and beaten up a member of their gang. They wanted revenge.</p><p>We tried every trick to elude them&#x2014;fleeing into tourist shops and through noisy restaurants, cutting through back alleys, abruptly crossing streets to reverse course, changing clothing, and when they got too close, leaving the sidewalk and running down the center of the boulevard, weaving through oncoming cars. At one point we stopped traffic to jump into a taxi in the middle of a three-lane boulevard, but they had cell phones and wherever we went they sent increasingly menacing tattooed thugs with steroid-bloated biceps to intercept us. As we dodged the gang of robbers, we witnessed them casually pick wallets from two more tourists. I even snapped photographs of them doing it&#x2014;a stupid mistake, as it turned out, because their lookout on my side of the street caught me doing it. The unshaven goon came running up the sidewalk jabbering Russian into a cell phone and extending a video camera in an unconvincing attempt to pass as a tourist. We fled down a side street. As they closed in on us, we were forced to jump into a taxi and escape to a small town an hour away.</p><p>In the cab, my daughter asked in a tone filled with shock and disbelief, &#x201c;Where did you learn to do that? I looked over and saw you swinging some guy around by the neck. I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what was happening.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed in nervous relief.</p><p>A 170-euro cab fare later, we were broke but safe.</p><p>Now my daughter is convinced that my job at the National Institutes of Health is just a cover for my real job as a spy.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>My daughter&#x2019;s and my experience in Barcelona with the pickpocket gang was the inspiration for this book. Where, indeed, had I learned to do what I had done? How, with the lightning-quick reflexes of someone snatching a fumbled coin from the air, had I unleashed such a flurry of moves on my attacker without conscious thought? Had I contemplated the situation, I never would have attempted such a thing. No amount of money is worth being injured or killed. I could have been kicked in the head by the gang as I struggled with their comrade on the ground and left to die brain damaged and in a coma. Or they could have easily held my daughter at knifepoint and used her as ransom. I never imagined that I would or could react this way. Yet it worked. One fifty-six-year-old tourist and his daughter had defeated a gang of criminals.</p><p>This unconscious explosion of violence to protect my daughter and myself is the same behavior that is triggered inappropriately in so many everyday instances of sudden and regrettable violence. We need to understand this unconscious neural circuitry and recognize what trips it.</p><p>In the aftermath of the attack I found myself wondering: Does everyone have this latent unconscious ability for rage waiting to be unleashed, or is this relatively uncommon? Would another person react differently&#x2014;rather than fight, become a helpless victim, run, or negotiate? Why? Which strategy is the best in which situation? Would I always react this way if caught unawares in similar circumstances? Whatever our response might be to sudden threats like this one, is there any way to control it? Can the inherently meek, if they exist, be taught to fight back (to overcome or ignore their meekness, as it were), or are our individual reactions to such threatening situations preprogrammed?</p><p>As a neuroscientist, I wonder how this unconscious reflex was possible. Without even seeing the robber in my peripheral vision I had snared the person by the neck and thrown him to the ground. How had my brain taken in all that information while my attention was fully occupied by the enormous challenges of negotiating my way through a strange new environment? Somewhere deep in my brain I must have been taking in this situational information unconsciously and guarding against the threat to which I was consciously oblivious. It had been a blind snatch. I did not really know who I had grabbed by the neck until the instant I saw my wallet being tossed to his fellow gang member, but the fact is, I found myself on the ground not with an eighty-year-old lady innocently walking in my blind spot: It was indeed the bad guy.</p><p>Until I found myself on concrete in combat, I had simply witnessed my violent reflexes unleash themselves. Clearly, in many dangerous situations the process of conscious thought would be too slow. As when recoiling from a hot stove, our unconscious protective reflex kicks in before we feel the burn consciously, revealing a deeply embedded automatic lifesaving reaction that through millions of years of evolutionary struggle has been preprogrammed into our DNA. But snatching your hand back from a burning-hot stove is a simple reflex. Responding appropriately to a perceived threat within a fluid social environment is far more complex&#x2014;yet your life or the life of friends and family will depend on executing the proper split-second reflex for either rage or retreat. The rage reflex can unleash furious, uncontrollable anger or, as in this instance, trigger a rage of intense and purposeful violence devoid of anger. In either case the response is automatic and apparently unchecked by rational thought.</p><p>The power of rage gives a petite woman strength to lift a car off the ground to free a trapped child. It is the stuff that drives a US Marine, 180 degrees against all normal instinct, to run into a hail of bullets to save a comrade in jeopardy. But sometimes this automatic lifesaving rage reflex embedded in our brain by evolution clashes against the modern world. &#x201c;I just snapped,&#x201d; the remorseful man confesses tearfully after having strangled his girlfriend in a fit of rage. Rage can ignite a crowd, resulting in sudden mob violence. The triggers can be small or large, individual or collective. The results can be devastating.</p><p>We must understand the biology of how the animal instinct inside us works in order to appreciate how rage arises. We must learn to control rage if possible, and to exploit it when necessary to save our lives. How much of this propensity toward rage is genetically predetermined and how much is learned? Precisely what is it in any given situation, and in an individual&#x2019;s personal history, that will trigger rage? Would I have reacted the same way to the pickpocket had I been traveling alone rather than with my daughter? Does the tendency to unleash rage reside latent in everyone, or is it only programmed into a few? How do men and women differ with respect to rage triggers? As individuals and societies we need to examine the beast within us and confront, in the context of modern society, the biological roots of rage.</p></p><h2>Judy: The Unforgettable Story of the Dog Who Went to War and Became a True Hero</h2><p><b>Award-winning journalist, Damien Lewis has spent twenty years reporting from war, disaster, and conflict zones. Now Lewis brings his first-rate narrative skills to bear on the inspiriting tale of Judy--an English pointer, and perhaps the only canine prisoner of war.</b><br><br> After being bombed and shipwrecked repeatedly while serving for several wild and war-torn years as a mascot of the World War II Royal Navy Yangtze river gunboats the <i>Gnat</i> and the <i>Grasshopper</i>, Judy ended up in Japanese prisoner of war camps in North Sumatra. Along with locals as slave labor, the American, Australian, and British POWs were forced to build a 1,200-mile single-track railroad through the most horrifying jungles and treacherous mountain passes. Like the one immortalized in the film <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>, this was the other death-railroad building project where POWs slaved under subhuman conditions.<br><br> In the midst of this living hell was a beautiful and regal-looking brown and white English pointer named Judy. Whether she was scavenging food to help feed the starving inmates of a hellish Japanese POW camp, or by her presence alone bringing inspiration and hope to men, she was cherished and adored by the Allied servicemen who fought to survive alongside her.<br><br> Judy's uncanny ability to sense danger, matched with her quick thinking and impossible daring saved countless lives. More than a close companion she shared in both the men's tragedies and joys. It was in recognition of the extraordinary friendship and protection she offered amidst the unforgiving and savage environment of a Japanese prison camp in Indonesia that she gained her formal status as a POW. <br>From the author of <i>The Dog Who Could Fly</i> and the co-author of Sergeant Rex and <i>It's All About Treo</i> comes one of the most heartwarming and inspiring tales you will ever read.</p><p><b>Damien Lewis</b> has spent twenty years reporting from war, disaster and conflict zones around the world. He has written a dozen non-fiction and fiction books, including <i>Zero Six Bravo.</i><br><b>Chapter One</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The tiny puppy wiggled her nose a little further under the wire.<br> &nbsp;<br> Blessed with a gundog&#x2019;s excellent peripheral vision she was keeping one eye on those to her rear &#x2013; her fellow siblings, plus the kennel staff who would little appreciate yet another escape attempt. Ahead of her, just a breath away, lay the outside world &#x2013; the teeming hustle and bustle of life that lay all about, but which she and her fellow pups were seemingly forever forbidden from experiencing.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was all just so tantalizingly close.<br> &nbsp;<br> The English-run Shanghai Dog Kennels had bred the beautiful liver-and-white English Pointer puppies to serve as gundogs for various English gentlemen then resident in Shanghai. But this one pup, it seemed, had other ideas. The Kennels were like an island of calm amid the sea of chaos that was 1936 Shanghai &#x2013; chaos to which the puppy poised halfway under the wire felt irresistibly drawn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before her very nose rickshaws &#x2013; ancient-looking wooden carts pulled by human bearers &#x2013; tore back and forth as they weaved through the dusty streets, carrying the better-off Shanghai residents trussed up in formal-looking top hats and dress-coats. Those rickety carriages fought for space with trams and buses, chugging their ponderous way past roadside stalls selling freshly fried and spiced delicacies. And everywhere bright red cloth banners hung from the shopfronts, advertising their wares in exotic-looking Mandarin and Wu calligraphy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why it was only she of her siblings who felt this insatiable urge to see, to smell and to taste the wider world &#x2013; to escape &#x2013; she didn&#x2019;t know. But ever since birth, curiosity had seemed to get the better of this, still nameless puppy. And now here she was, glistening nose thrust under the wire and twitching at the bewitching smells that assaulted it, round and chubby backside still within the safe confines of the kennel, but with only a few more wriggles and a final squeeze required to break free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Doubtless, one voice inside the pup&#x2019;s head was telling her: don&#x2019;t do it! But another, equally strident voice was urging &#x2013; go for it, girl! In that moment of indecision as she peered beneath the wire the little puppy heard a yell of alarm from behind. She&#x2019;d been spotted! It was the cry of Lee Ming, the local Chinese girl whose mother lived and worked at the kennels, raising the alarm. Lee Ming was quick and nimble and would be on her like a flash unless she got a move on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tiny forepaws thrashed and scrabbled at the dirt, as she fought to squeeze her way under the wire. The wrinkly folds of puppy fat rolled and gave beneath her, as she got her belly down even lower and wriggled like a fat fish stuck on an angler&#x2019;s hook. The bare stub of a tail, sticking out behind her like a long and rigid finger, twitched to and fro as she strove with all her might to break free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind her Lee Ming came to a sudden halt and reached to grab the disobedient puppy, but as she did so the tiny ball of irrepressible energy gave one last Herculean effort and she was through. An instant and a scamper later and &#x2013; pouf! &#x2013; the diminutive four-legged figure was gone, paws flying as she was swallowed up into the noise and dust and utter disorder of downtown Shanghai.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a horrible moment Lee Ming stared after the puppy that had disappeared, in complete dismay. There were so many dangers stalking those city streets that she didn&#x2019;t have the heart to imagine the half of them. If there was one thing the little puppy wasn&#x2019;t, it was streetwise. In her headlong confusion she might be run over by a rickshaw. In her fright she might tumble into one of the city&#x2019;s myriad open sewers. But worst of all, a roly-poly puppy like her would offer a tantalizing meal to those partial to dog meat &#x2013; which included the large majority of the city&#x2019;s native population.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1936 Shanghai the flesh of man&#x2019;s best friend was much sought-after, being seen as something of a &#x2018;sweet&#x2019;-tasting delicacy. A young and tender dog that no one seemed to own or to care for would be fair game. Lee Ming turned back towards the large, colonial-style house that lay in the centre of the kennel compound. She headed for reception to report the bad news, and to help raise whatever search party they would send after the wayward pup. But her heart was heavy and a dark foreboding lay upon her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She feared very much that was the last they&#x2019;d ever see of the puppy that had run away.<br> &nbsp;<br> ==#==<br> &nbsp;<br> The Shanghai that the puppy had made a break for was no place for any defenceless being, let alone an English Pointer barely a few weeks old. Then a city of some three million inhabitants, Shanghai &#x2013; a port city lying in the very centre of China&#x2019;s coastline &#x2013; was a bustling metropolis red in tooth and claw. Positioned at the mouth of the mighty Yangtze River &#x2013; Asia&#x2019;s longest, and a vital conduit for trade and commerce into China&#x2019;s vast interior &#x2013; the great powers of Britain, America and France had long-established trading settlements in the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> For decades, Shanghai had been known as &#x2018;The Paris of the East&#x2019;, but in recent years she had become a city beset by troubles. Weak leadership and infighting among the Chinese government had allowed vicious gangs of bandits to thrive. Warlords had taken control of large tracts of the nation&#x2019;s interior. Increasingly, Britain, America and France had been forced to send gunboats far into the interior on the Yangtze, in an effort to dissuade these lawless elements from disrupting their lucrative trade in silk, cotton, tea and other valuable commodities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recently, trouble had piled upon trouble, in particular with the resurgence of China&#x2019;s age-old enemy &#x2013; Japan. In an escalating series of bloody skirmishes the Japanese Navy had bombarded Shanghai. As they had with the British and the other &#x2018;great powers&#x2019;, the Chinese were forced to sign a treaty with Imperial Japan, allowing the Japanese to establish a permanent presence in the &#x2018;treaty port&#x2019; of Shanghai. Imperial Japan made little secret of her desire to conquer and subjugate the entire Chinese nation, and Shanghai was the gateway to China&#x2019;s then capital city, Nanking.<br> &nbsp;<br> This then was Shanghai, the city that the escapee from the kennels had absconded to &#x2013; one menaced by gangland banditry, and whose streets were increasingly plagued by soldiers from Imperial Japan, who showed ill-disguised contempt for the local inhabitants. So it was something of a miracle that several weeks after her dramatic breakout, the puppy who had run away was still very much alive and breathing.<br> &nbsp;<br> The silky chubbiness was long gone, of course. Instead, adolescent ribs poked through a liver-and-white coat that had lost much of its shine and lustre. Her nose was dry and cracked, a sure sign that she was in a dreadful condition. Only her eyes seemed to demonstrate their signature brightness, betraying a strength of character that had distinguished her from birth, and perhaps led to her present, unenviable predicament. They shone with a burning curiosity and a zest for life, despite all that she had suffered since her ill-fated &#x2018;escape&#x2019;. But there was something else now in her gaze &#x2013; uncertainty and vulnerability, a sense that the young dog had realized to her cost that not every human was her natural friend and ally.<br> &nbsp;<br> How stupid she had been, she now recognized, to run away. She had traded the comfort and luxury of the kennels for a battered old cardboard box lying in a smelly, fly-blown Shanghai alleyway. She&#x2019;d traded the companionship and playfulness of her brother and sister puppies for the loneliness of life on the streets. And in place of the English kennel owner&#x2019;s natural love for and protection over their dogs, she&#x2019;d faced cruelty and abuse at every turn in this overcrowded human zoo of a city.<br> &nbsp;<br> All apart from one individual &#x2013; Soo. For whatever reason, Soo the Chinese trader was an unreconstructed lover of dogs. Her shabby box-cum-home lay to the rear of his store, and ever since the puppy had found her way to it Soo had taken it upon himself to deliver titbits of food to her, of an evening when his long day&#x2019;s work was done. It was hardly the kind of diet she&#x2019;d grown accustomed to at the kennels, but at least it had served to keep her alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like many Chinese, it wasn&#x2019;t in Soo&#x2019;s nature or family tradition to keep a dog at home as a pet. In the China of 1936 dogs had to earn their keep as working animals, or they were invariably for the pot. In fact, the eating of dog meat in China had a history stretching back thousands of years, the meat being thought to possess mystical medicinal properties. There were even some breeds of dog that were kept specifically for human consumption, especially in times of seasonal hunger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, Soo wasn&#x2019;t one of those who were partial to having dog on the menu, and the lost puppy from the Shanghai Dog Kennels was lucky indeed to have fallen by chance under his protection.<br> &nbsp;<br> But tonight, all of that was about to change.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a sixth sense that was to become her absolute trademark, the lonely pup detected the danger before it was audible or visible to any human ear or eye, Soo&#x2019;s included. A Japanese gunboat had docked in the port of Shanghai, and the sailors of the His Japanese Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s Ship were making their noisy way along the very road upon which Soo&#x2019;s shop was situated, no doubt in search of alcohol and some locals on which to vent their aggression. It was late evening, but the hardworking Soo was still there, his being one of the few stores on the street remaining open.<br> &nbsp;<br> That alone offered enough of an excuse for the gunboat crew to pounce.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the Japanese sailors started verbally abusing Soo and helping themselves to his wares, he of course protested. Voices were raised in anger, but the Japanese sailors didn&#x2019;t stop there. Within minutes Soo&#x2019;s shop had been plundered, its rickety wooden shelves torn down and smashed to pieces. As for Soo, he was set upon by the Japanese sailors, who were working themselves up into a towering rage.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hearing her one protector in the world being so cruelly assaulted, the adolescent pup had stolen out of her alleyway and sneaked around the corner to see if there was anything she could do to save him. Inching forward on her belly, she alternately whimpered in fright and tried to muster her most threatening growl, as the strange figures in their baggy trousers over knee-high black boots kicked and punched her protector.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then one of the aggressors spotted the cowering dog. He stepped away from Soo and took a few paces towards her. Moments later one of those perfectly polished boots was swinging towards the adolescent puppy&#x2019;s midriff. The powerful blow lifted her from the cobbles and flung her across the street into a pile of rubbish on the far side. There she lay, whimpering and in agony, and hoping beyond hope that these cruel men in their strange uniforms wouldn&#x2019;t come for her again.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time their oppressors had departed, Soo had been beaten so badly that he had to be helped away from the scene. The dog that had until now viewed him as her protector was forced to take refuge in the empty shadows of a nearby doorway. Into it she crawled, body sore from the kicking, belly sore from that and the ravening hunger, and her spirit numbed by the trauma and the cold of the long night that lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though the Japanese sailors were long gone, the lonely puppy sensed that tonight her dream of escape from the Shanghai Kennels had descended into the blackest of nightmares &#x2013; but as is so often the case, the darkest moment is just before the dawn.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the sun crept above the city&#x2019;s grand, colonial-style skyline, a familiar figure began to pad her way along the street on which the young dog lay. The lone puppy was shivering and crying to herself and lost in misery &#x2013; so much so that she almost didn&#x2019;t notice the pitter-patter of footsteps come to a halt, or to hear the words uttered in amazement in her direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Shudi? Shudi? Oh, Shudi! What happened? Where have you been?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The long tail of the Pointer &#x2013; now stained off-white with the dirt and soot from her street-side existence &#x2013; almost failed to wag in any sign of recognition. But the young dog had recognized the soft tones of the voice, just as surely as the little girl from the kennels had recognized the distraught puppy. Her distinctive markings &#x2013; a sleek liver-brown head, a similarly-coloured saddle-like marking thrown across her shoulders, plus the large formless splodge of colour splashed across her rear right flank &#x2013; had been instantly recognizable to Lee Ming.<br> &nbsp;<br> No doubt about it &#x2013; this was the one that had run away!<br> &nbsp;<br> In a sprawling city of some three million inhabitants the girl from the Shanghai Kennels had, by chance, chosen to walk that morning past the very door where the lost and injured dog was sheltering. Lee Ming bent, scooped the puppy up and thrust her deep inside her jacket. With that she ran and skipped through the largely deserted streets, eager to announce her find to the English lady who ran the kennels.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time she had reached the big house that lay inside the compound and unzipped her jacket, the puppy had fallen fast asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Look! Look! I find Shudi!&#x2019; the little girl announced ecstatically.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Englishwoman peered doubtfully over the high desk behind which she sat. Spying the puppy, she reached out uncertainly and took the little dog from the girl&#x2019;s outstretched arms. She pulled her closer, stroked her and fondled her just behind the ears, as she studied the markings and tried to compare them to those in her memory. The puppy opened one lazy eye, saw where she was, seemed to smile exhaustedly then slipped back into a sweet sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the turn of the Englishwoman to smile. &#x2018;It is her. It really is the one who ran away.&#x2019; She glanced at Lee Ming who was beaming with happiness. &#x2018;So, I think it&#x2019;s time you gave her a good bath and a dinner, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming nodded enthusiastically. There was nothing she&#x2019;d like more than to feed and comfort the wayward pup. She held out her arms so &#x2018;Shudi&#x2019; could be returned to her and she could whisk her off for some much-needed tender loving care.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman handed the pup across. She glanced at Lee Ming curiously. &#x2018;But tell me, why do you call her Shudi?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming placed the warm but exhausted bundle back inside her jacket. &#x2018;I always call this one Shudi,&#x2019; she replied shyly. &#x2018;Shudi means peaceful. Peaceful is how she looks, yes?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman reached out and caressed Lee Ming&#x2019;s face. &#x2018;She does. Yes she does. And Lee Ming &#x2013; that shall be her name from now on: Judy.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> So it was that the puppy who had run away and come back again against all odds was given a name perhaps most ill-suited to her nature: the Mandarin word for the peaceful one &#x2013; shudi &#x2013; or rendered into &#x2018;Judy&#x2019; for whichever lucky Englishman might be her future master.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the little girl carried Shudi &#x2013; Judy &#x2013; off for a good pamper, little did she realize how a dog with such inauspicious beginnings would go on to distinguish herself in the coming bloody and allconsuming conflict . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming could have no idea how famous the English Pointer from the Shanghai Kennels would become, once the Second World War drew to a close.<br></p><h2>Do As I Say (Not As I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy</h2><p>Prominent liberals support a whole litany of policies and principles: progressive taxes, affirmative action, greater regulation of corporations, raising the inheritance tax, strict environmental regulations, children&#x2019;s rights, consumer rights, and more. But do they actually live by these beliefs? Peter Schweizer decided to investigate the private lives of politicians like the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, the Kennedys, and Ralph Nader; commentators Michael Moore, Al Franken, Noam Chomsky, and Cornel West; entertainers or philanthropists Barbra Streisand and George Soros. Using publicly-available real estate records, IRS returns, court depositions, and their own published statements, he sought to examine whether they lived by the principles they so forcefully advocate.<br><br>What he found was a long list of contradictions. Many of these proponents of organized labor had developed various methods to sidestep paying union wages or avoid employing unions altogether. They were also adept at avoiding taxes; invested heavily in corporations they had denounced; took advantage of foreign tax credits to use non-American labor overseas; espoused environmental causes while opposing those that might affect their own property rights; hid their investments in trusts to avoid paying estate tax; denounced oil companies but quietly owned them. <br><br>Schweizer&#x2019;s conclusion is simple: liberalism in the end forces its adherents to become hypocrites. They adopt one pose in public, but when it comes to what matters most in their own lives&#x2013;their property, their privacy, and their children--they jettison their liberal principles and adopt conservative ones. If these ideas don&#x2019;t work for the very individuals who promote them, Schweizer asks, how can they work for the country?</p><p>The American Left prides itself on a selfless commitment to economic and social justice. With moral certitude, confident of the purity of their motives and the evil nature of their opponents, they support a familiar litany of causes and programs: progressive taxes, affirmative action, greater regulation of corporations, increasing the inheritance tax, stricter environmental safeguards, consumer rights, and more. <br>But do liberals actually practice what they preach? Peter Schweizer dug deep into the tax returns, real estate documents, business and investment patterns, court depositions, and hiring practices of Michael Moore, Al Franken, Noam Chomsky, the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, the Kennedys, Ralph Nader, Cornel West, George Soros and Barbra Streisand. All are adept at avoiding taxes, invest in the very industries they denounce, and abandon environmental causes when they impinge on their own property rights. While they cry racism and support affirmative action, they have abysmal records when it comes to hiring minorities. They condemn abstinence-based sex ed programs, but enroll their own children in such programs. <br>Schweizer makes it clear that when it comes to what matters most in their lives--the protection of their property, privacy, and families--even the most outspoken liberals jettison their progressive ideas and adopt conservative principles. In short, liberalism forces its adherents to become hypocrites. Schweizer's conclusion is strikingly simple and highly persuasive: liberal principles that don't work for individuals have no place in shaping national programs and policies.<p>PETER SCHWEIZER is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several books, including <i>Reagan&#x2019;s War</i> and <i>The Bushes</i>.

Yet, because of its very antiquity and the centuries during which the language was forgotten, ancient Egyptian literature is a newly discovered country for modern readers.</p><p>This anthology offers an extensive sampling of all the major genres of ancient Egyptian literature. It includes all the texts from John Foster's previous book Echoes of Egyptian Voices, along with selections from his Love Songs of the New Kingdom and Hymns, Prayers, and Songs: An Anthology of Ancient Egyptian Lyric Poetry, as well as previously unpublished translations of four longer and two short poems. Foster's translations capture the poetical beauty of the Egyptian language and the spirit that impelled each piece's composition, making these ancient masterworks sing for modern readers. An introduction to ancient Egyptian literature and its translation, as well as brief information about the authorship and date of each selection, completes the volume.</p></p><p>John L. Foster was a Research Associate at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, where he studied, translated, and wrote about ancient Egyptian literature from 1966 until his death in 2011.This exceptional sampling of one of the world's most ancient literatures offers more than 40 hymns, stories, prayers, and songs revolving around religion, the Pharaohs, life, death, love, and more. The literary translation presents a critical reading of the ancient texts rather than a strict literal rendering. We do not know for certain how to pronounce the language as it was spoken 3000 to 4000 years ago, but Foster (research associate, Oriental Inst., Chicago) includes a number of poems in their original hieroglyphs, adding an exotic touch. The introduction to ancient Egyptian literature, as well as information about the authorship and chronology of each selection, helps to place the works in context. An excellent glossary explains many of the ancient concepts for the modern reader, who will discover that the splendor of Pharaonic visual art of which we know and see plenty has its parallel in literature. Highly recommended for all literary collections, this is also of interest to comprehensive collections of Egyptology, Near Eastern history, world literature in translation, and religion.

Even the increasing number in the West today who have abandoned the faith of their forebears, and dismiss all religion as pointless superstition, remain recognisably its heirs. Seen close-up, the division between a sceptic and a believer may seem unbridgeable. Widen the focus, though, and Christianity's enduring impact upon the West can be seen in the emergence of much that has traditionally been cast as its nemesis: in science, in secularism, and yes, even in atheism. </p><p>That is why <i>Dominion </i>will place the story of how we came to be what we are, and how we think the way that we do, in the broadest historical context. Ranging in time from the Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC to the on-going migration crisis in Europe today, and from Nebuchadnezzar to the Beatles, it will explore just what it was that made Christianity so revolutionary and disruptive; how completely it came to saturate the mind-set of Latin Christendom; and why, in a West that has become increasingly doubtful of religion's claims, so many of its instincts remain irredeemably Christian. The aim is twofold: to make the reader appreciate just how novel and uncanny were Christian teachings when they first appeared in the world; and to make ourselves, and all that we take for granted, appear similarly strange in consequence. We stand at the end-point of an extraordinary transformation in the understanding of what it is to be human: one that can only be fully appreciated by tracing the arc of its parabola over millennia.</p></p><p></p><h2>Work Matters: Connecting Sunday Worship to Monday Work</h2><p><p><em>Work</em>. For some this word represents drudgery and the mundane. For others work is an idol to be served. If you find yourself anywhere on the spectrum from workaholic to weekend warrior, it&#x2019;s time to bridge the gap between Sunday worship and Monday work.</p><p>Striking a balance between theological depth and practical counsel, Tom Nelson outlines God&#x2019;s purposes for work in a way that helps us to make the most of our vocation and to join God in his work in the world. Discover a new perspective on work that will transform your workday and make the majority of your waking hours matter, not only now, but for eternity.</p><p><em><br></em></p></p><p><p><strong>Tom Nelson</strong> (DMin, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) has served as senior pastor of Christ Community Church in Leawood, Kansas, for more than twenty years.

In <em>Work Matters</em>, Tom Nelson examines how God uses our work, even the ordinary and routine, to transform us and to reveal our gifts and calling. I have known Tom for several years, and his life and work exemplify these profound and practical truths. His book will inspire and encourage you to reexamine not only your understanding of work but yourself as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ravi Zacharias</strong>, Founder and President, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries; author, <em>Jesus Among Other Gods</em></p><p>&#x201c;Tom Nelson does a marvelous job of walking his readers through a robust theology of work, and he does so in a very provocative way. We are all Jesus&#x2019;s apprentices and our work lives are filled with opportunities for spiritual growth and discipleship. <em>Work Matters</em> will compel you to approach work differently.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Moe Girkins</strong>, author, <em>Mother Leads Best</em></p><p>&#x201c;Tom Nelson and I have been walking down the same pathway as we have been learning together more and more about how God views work. Tom&#x2019;s conclusions, insights, and examples will help many people get a better grip on serving God and finding purpose in the work place. This book is thoughtful, practical, entertaining, and true to Scripture. The lights are going to suddenly come on in many readers&#x2019; minds, and that&#x2019;s not just great fun but a good thing as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Yates</strong>, Rector, The Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia</p><p>&#x201c;By definition, every Christian is in full-time ministry. Yet, unfortunately, many of us see a great divide between the secular and spiritual, ministry and work. In <em>Work Matters</em>, Tom Nelson helps to bridge the artificial and unbiblical gap that keeps us from fully realizing our calling and full potential in Christ. Read it. It will change the way you think about Monday to Friday.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Larry Osborne</strong>, Pastor, North Coast Church, Vista, California; author, <em>Sticky Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;More than just a book, <em>Work Matters</em> is a kaleidoscopic testimony to the power of calling in the lives of a vibrant local church, inspired to engage their community and city. If every pastor taught like this and every church lived like this, America would be a very different country.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Os Guinness,</strong>&nbsp;author, <em>The Call</em></p><p>&#x201c;Not many pastors are adept at encouraging the Christians they serve to think deeply about the work they undertake during the six days when they are not gathering for corporate worship. So many of our applications and exhortations, as important and as faithful as they are, deal with prayer, Bible reading, family relationships, and evangelism, and not with the work that takes up much of our time and that we are called to offer up to God. I first heard Tom Nelson bring some clarity to these matters in some addresses at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and I am delighted to see his reflections expanded and put into print. This book is greatly needed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A.

The idea that this moment on Sunday can actually be a time for both celebrating the Savior <em>and</em> for strategically shaping what happens when we leave those four walls is rarely considered. <em>Work Matters</em> takes a look into the Christian&#x2019;s life, offering strategic insight into the work place as a key part of God&#x2019;s Kingdom agenda and explaining how Sunday&#x2019;s worship experience can spill over into Monday through Saturday. A great work indeed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stan Archie,</strong> Vice President, Missouri State Board of Education; Senior Pastor, Christian Fellowship Church, Kansas City, Missouri</p><p>&#x201c;This is a very important book written by a pastor who I respect immensely. <em>Work Matters</em> will change how you view your vocation and in the process it may just change your life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Adam Hamilton</strong>,&nbsp;Senior Pastor, The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, Leawood, Kansas; author, <em>The Journey: Walking the Road to Bethlehem</em></p><p>&#x201c;Tom Nelson offers the world a profoundly rich vision of vocation as integral to the mission of God in history&#x2015;by a pastor who has spent the years of his life helping his people understand what they do and why they do what they do in light of the truest truths of the universe. Theologically serious and pastorally aware, no one has tried to do what he has done, and has done so well. For pastors and for their people, indeed for everyone who wants to connect the vocation of the ministry with vocations in the marketplace; it will change the conversation about calling because it will change the way we understand worship and work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stever Garber</strong>,&nbsp;Director, The Washington Institute for Faith, Vocation, and Culture; author, <em>The Fabric of Faithfulness</em></p><p>&#x201c;In a most readable and engaging style, Tom Nelson gives us a complete, biblical understanding of work&#x2015;starting with &#x2018;in the beginning,&#x2019; when God created us to work. Coming from his engagement with workers of all sorts in his own congregation, Nelson has seen the truth of the gospel transform their lives and work in a powerful way. This book delivers no small message: the gospel changes everything! It transforms people at the core of our being, our motivations for work, how we behave, and the influence of our work in God&#x2019;s creation.

As the sheriff here, I'm used to writing incident reports, not chatty letters. But my daughter, Megan&#x2014;who'll be making me a grandfather soon&#x2014;told me I had to do this. So here goes.<br><br>I'll tell you straight out that I'd hoped to marry Faith Beckwith (my onetime high school girlfriend) but she ended the relationship last month, even though we're both widowed and available. There were a few misunderstandings between us, some of them inadvertently caused by Megan.<br><br>However, I've got plenty to keep me occupied, like the unidentified remains found in a cave outside town. And the fact that my friend Judge Olivia Griffin is fighting cancer. And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane&#x2014;the house Faith happens to be renting from Grace Harding...<br><br>If you want to hear more, come on over to my place or to the sheriff's office&#x2014;if you can stand the stale coffee!<br><br><em>Troy Davis</em><br><br></p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

He knew this town and he knew these people; he was one of them. Four times now he'd been elected to the office of sheriff by an overwhelming majority.<br><br>Sitting at his desk on this bleak January day, he let his mind wander as he sipped stale coffee. The department stuff was never good, no matter how recently it'd been brewed. As he sat there, he thought about Sandy, his wife of more than thirty years. She'd died last year of complications related to MS. Her death had left a gaping hole in his life. He'd often discussed his cases with her and had come to appreciate her insights. She usually had opinions, carefully considered ones, on what led people to commit the crimes that brought them to his attention.<br><br>Troy would've been interested in her views on one of his current cases. A couple of local teenagers had come upon skeletal remains in a cave not far from the road leading out of town. Partial results of the autopsy were finally in, but they raised more questions than they answered. Additional tests were forthcoming, and they might provide further information. He could only hope.... Hard though it was to believe, the body had gone all this time without discovery, and no one seemed to know who it was.<br><br>Despite this perplexing&#x2014;and very cold&#x2014;case and, of course, the loss of his wife, Troy had reason to count his blessings. He had a comfortable life, good friends and his only child, Megan, was married to a fine young man. In fact, Troy couldn't have chosen a better husband for his daughter had he handpicked Craig himself. In a few months, Megan would give birth to his first grandchild.<br><br>As far as finances went, Troy had no complaints. His house was paid off and so was his car. He enjoyed his work and had strong ties to the community.<br><br>And yet... he was miserable.<br><br>That misery could be attributed to one source.<br><br>Faith Beckwith.<br><br>Troy had reconnected with his high-school girlfriend, and almost before he realized what was happening, he'd fallen in love with her all over again.<br><br>Neither of them possessed an impulsive personality. They were adults; they'd known what they wanted and what they were doing.<br><br>Then the relationship that had seemed so promising had come to a sudden end&#x2014;thanks to his daughter's reaction and to some undeniably bad judgment on Troy's part.<br><br>When Megan learned he was dating again so soon after her mother's death, she'd been very upset. Troy understood his daughter's feelings. It <em>had </em>only been a few months since they'd buried Sandy; however, Sandy had been ill for years, and in some ways, their farewells had been said long before. But the fact that Troy had hidden his relationship with Faith from his daughter had contributed significantly to the whole mess.<br><br>On the very evening Troy had planned to ask Faith to marry him, Megan had miscarried her first pregnancy. As luck would have it, Troy, who'd been with Faith, had turned off his cell phone.<br><br>His guilt had been overwhelming. The baby had meant everything to Megan and Craig, especially so soon after Sandy's death.<br><br>In retrospect Troy saw that he'd completely mishandled the situation. Immediately after Megan's miscarriage he'd broken off the relationship with Faith. He'd acted out of remorse but he hadn't taken Faith's feelings into account; her shock and pain haunted him to this day.<br><br>He'd dedicated himself to his daughter and her needs ever since. That didn't meanhe'd stopped thinking about Faith&#x2014;far from it. Thoughts of her filled his every waking moment.<br><br>To complicate this already complicated situation, Faith had sold her Seattle home and moved to Cedar Cove to be closer to her son, Scott&#x2014;and to Troy. Seeing her around town these days was torture. Faith had made it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him. Troy didn't blame her.<br><br>"I have that missing-persons file for you, Sheriff." Cody Woodchase stepped into his office and set the folder in Troy's in-basket.<br><br>"Thanks," Troy murmured. "You checked the appropriate dates?"<br><br>Cody nodded, dutifully efficient. "And came up blank. The only major case I can personally recall was Daniel Sherman a few years back."<br><br>Troy was well aware of the outcome. His old high-school friend had walked away from his family for no apparent reason. He'd simply vanished. The case had bothered Troy for well over a year. As it turned out, Dan had committed suicide, his body eventually found in the woods.<br><br>"That one was solved," Troy pointed out.<br><br>"I remember," Cody said. "Anyway, I pulled all the pertinent missing-persons files and printed them out for you."<br><br>"Thanks." Troy reached for the folder as soon as Cody left his office. Cedar Cove was fortunate enough to have a low crime rate. Oh, there was the occasional public disturbance, domestic violence now and then, a break-in, a drunk driver&#x2014;the sort of crime common to any small town. There was a mystery every once in a while, too. The biggest that came to mind was the man who'd shown up at Thyme and Tide, the Beldons' B and B. The stranger had the misfortune to die that very night. But that case, which was actually a murder, had been solved, too.<br><br>And now...the human remains, found just before Christmas.<br><br>According to the autopsy, they were those of a young man. A teenage boy between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Based on those bones, there was no obvious cause of death. No blunt-force trauma, for instance. He'd been dead as long as twenty-five to thirty years.<br><br>Twenty-five to thirty years!<br><br>Troy had been with the department back then, untested and eager to prove himself. Sandy was pregnant after miscarrying twice, optimistic that this time they'd have their baby.<br><br>If a missing teenager had been reported in the late '70s or early '80s, Troy was confident he would've remembered it. The files Cody had printed out indicated that he was right. Not a single case involving a missing teenager, male or female, had been left unresolved.<br><br>To be on the safe side, he checked five years before and five years after. Twelve boys, mostly runaways, had been reported missing in that time. They'd all been found, either returning of their own accord or located by friends, relatives or the authorities.<br><br>Surely this young man had family, a mother and father, who must have wondered and waited in anguish. Troy closed his eyes and tried to think of boys he'd known during that time. Random names and faces rushed through his mind.<br><br>Around 1985, he recalled, Cedar Cove High School had won the state baseball championship. He could picture the first baseman, Robbie something, and Weaver, one of his deputies now, who'd been the team's star pitcher. Troy had attended all the play-off games. Sandy had gone with him and, although she wasn't a real baseball fan, she'd clapped and yelled her heart out.<br><br>Oh, how he missed Sandy....<br><br>Troy had visited her grave a couple of times over the holidays. Even at the end, when her body had failed her and MS had stolen much of her dignity, she'd been cheerful. He missed her appreciation of life's simple joys.<br><br>At least he and Megan were over <em>the firsts</em>&#x2014;the first Thanksgiving without Sandy. The first Christmas. The first birthday, wedding anniversary and Mother's Day... Those were the big ones, when her loss felt like a burden that would never grow lighter. When he and his daughter both acknowledged that nothing would ever be the same.<br><br>Troy was startled out of his reverie by someone calling his name.<br><br>"Am I interrupting anything important?" Louie Benson asked, standing in the office doorway.<br><br>"Louie." Troy rose to his feet. It wasn't every day he received a visit from the mayor of Cedar Cove. "Come on in. Good to see you." He gestured toward the chair in front of his desk.<br><br>"Happy New Year," Louie said as he slid into the seat. He rested one ankle on the opposite knee, striking a relaxed pose.<br><br>"Same to you," Troy said and sat back down. "What can I do for you?" The mayor was a busy man and didn't waste time on unnecessary visits. The fact was, Troy couldn't remember when Louie had last sought him out. Oh, they ran into each other often enough; that was unavoidable, since they worked in the same office complex. Socially they were acquaintances and he saw Louie at civic functions or the occasional party.<br><br>Louie's expression grew serious, and he leaned forward. "I've got a couple of things I want to discuss with you."<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>Louie looked down at the floor. "First, I want to remind you that I'm up for reelection this November. I was hoping for an endorsement."<br><br>"It's yours." Troy was surprised the other man felt the need to bring it up so early in the year. Besides, he'd supported Louie's previous campaigns. Nothing had changed. To the best of his knowledge, no other candidates had declared their intentions to run against him.<br><br>"I value your support," Louie said. "And of course you have mine." His gaze fell on Troy's desk. "On another matter... What can you tell me about those remains that were recently discovered?"<br><br>"I got the autopsy report a few days ago," Troy told him. "Jack Griffin ran an article about it in the <em>Chronicle </em>over the weekend. I'd hoped someone might step forward with information as a result. Dental evidence is useless because without a name we can't get a chart for comparison. To date, I have nothing."<br><br>Louie leaned back in his chair and eyed the open folder on Troy's desk. "So... no clue who that unfortunate soul might be?"<br><br>"None whatsoever."<br><br>This didn't appear to please the mayor. "The reason I'm pushing you on this is that I got a call from the Seattle paper. Apparently Jack's story aroused some interest there. They want to do a piece on those unidentified remains." The mayor's frown deepened. "I tried to steer the reporter away from the subject, but she seems determined to find out whatever she can. I gave her your contact information, so expect a call."<br><br>"Must be a slow news day." Troy appreciated getting advance notice. "Thanks for the heads-up." Over the years he'd dealt with the press many times and was accustomed to handling reporters. He had nothing against them as long as they didn't probe where they didn't belong or print misinformation.<br><br>"My fear," Louie went on to explain, "is that a negative story will hurt Cedar Cove's reputation. We want to attract tourists, not drive them away with... with ghoulish stories about our town."<br><br>"At this point there's nothing for them to report," Troy reassured him.<br><br>"Have you found out <em>anything?" </em>Louie inquired.<br><br>"Not really." Troy shrugged. "Pretty much what Jack wrote in that article. The remains are those of a male, between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. He's been dead since 1980, give or take a few years. No indication how he died."<br><br>Louie seemed uninterested in the details. "The thing is, Cedar Cove doesn't need any bad press. Our initiative this year is to attract more tourists to the area. I hate the thought of Cedar Cove becoming the center of some macabre story about unidentified remains and an unsolved mystery."<br><br>Troy nodded. "Yeah, I hear you."<br><br>"Good." Louie rose to his feet. "Do your best to solve this as quickly as possible."<br><br>Standing up, too, Troy opened his mouth to assure the mayor he was doing the best he could, but he wasn't given the opportunity.<br><br>"I'm not saying I want you to sweep anything under the rug, you understand?" the mayor said.<br><br>"Of course I won't."<br><br>"Good." Louie extended his hand and Troy shook it. "Make sure nothing sensational or misleading gets printed, okay? Like I said, I want Cedar Cove to become a tourist destination, not some freak sideshow."<br><br>"Do you remember the reporter's name?" Troy asked.<br><br>"I doubt I'd forget it. Kathleen Sadler."<br><br>"Kathleen Sadler," Troy repeated. "Not to worry, I'll set her straight."<br><br>"Thanks." Louie gave him a relieved smile. "I knew I could count on you."<br><br>When the mayor had left, Troy went back to the paperwork on his desk. The phone rang frequently that afternoon, but there was no call from the reporter. He just hoped Kathleen Sadler hadn't taken it upon herself to investigate the actual location. The cave was still taped off, but a piece of yellow crime-scene tape wasn't always a deterrent to determined reporters.<br><br>Troy had kept the names of the two teenagers who'd discovered the body out of the <em>Chronicle. </em>However, that didn't mean Sadler wouldn't be able to track them down.<br><br>After they'd stumbled upon the remains, Troy had spoken to the teens twice. He was confident Philip "Shaw" Wilson and Tannith Bliss had told him everything they knew, which wasn't much. The conversations had been straightforward. Although Tannith&#x2014; Tanni&#x2014;had done a good job of pretending to shrug off the incident, Troy could tell she'd been badly shaken. He was glad to turn the sixteen-year-old over to her mother.<br><br>The last thing Tanni needed was to be questioned by the Seattle press. Shaw was a bit older and Troy felt the young man would cope admirably with a barrage of questions. It might not hurt to give the two of them some warning.<br><br>His phone rang and Troy grabbed it, prepared to talk to the elusive Kathleen Sadler. "Sheriff Davis."<br><br>"Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing you unnecessarily." It was Cody Woodchase.<br><br>Troy caught the hesitation in his voice. "You're not. What's up?"<br><br>"I just got a call from the 9-1-1 dispatcher and apparently there's been a break-and-enter at 204 Rosewood Lane."<br><br>"Faith?" Troy's reaction was immediate as he bolted to his feet. That was the address of the rental house where Faith had recently moved. She'd been there a little more than two months.<br><br>"I believe I heard she might be a... friend of yours."<br><br>"Yes," Troy said curtly, his throat muscles tight.<br><br>"I thought you'd want to know."<br><br>"I do, Cody. Thank you." Within seconds, Troy had thrown on his coat and reached for his hat. He charged out the office door, unable to think of anything but Faith. He needed to know she hadn't been hurt, that she was safe from harm.<br><br></p><h2>A Thousand Splendid Suns</h2><p>After more than two years on the bestseller lists and over four million copies in print, Khaled Hosseini returns with a beautiful, riveting, and haunting novel of enormous contemporary relevance. <p> <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan&#x2019;s last thirty years&#x2014;from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding&#x2014;that puts the violence, fear, hope, and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives&#x2014;the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness&#x2014;are inextricable from the history playing out around them.</p> <p>Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made <i>The Kite Runner</i> a beloved classic, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love&#x2014;a stunning accomplishment.</p></p><p>It's difficult to imagine a harder first act to follow than <i>The Kite Runner</i>: a debut novel by an unknown writer about a country many readers knew little about that has gone on to have over four million copies in print worldwide. But when preview copies of Khaled Hosseini's second novel, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i>, started circulating at Amazon.com, readers reacted with a unanimous enthusiasm that few of us could remember seeing before. As special as <i>The Kite Runner</i> was, those readers said, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is more so, bringing Hosseini's compassionate storytelling and his sense of personal and national tragedy to a tale of two women that is weighted equally with despair and grave hope. <p> We wanted to spread the word on the book as widely, and as soon, as we could.

This is a brilliant writer and I look forward to more of his work." <i>Read Joanna Daneman's review</i><br><br> <b>Seth J. Frantzman</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has done it again with 'A Thousand Splendid Sons', presenting a new, dashing and dark tale of two generations of women trapped in a loveless marriage, bracketed by great events." <i>Read Seth J. Frantzman's review</i><br><br> <b>Donald Mitchell</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has succeeded in capturing many important historical and contemporary themes in a way that will make your heart ache again and again. Why will your reaction be so strong? It&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ll identify closely with the suffering of almost all the characters, a reaction that&#x2019;s very rare to a modern novel." <i>Read Donald Mitchell's review</i><br><br> <b>Lawrance M. Bernabo</b>: "All things considered, following up on a successful first novel is probably harder than coming up with the original effort and Hosseini could have rested on his laurels in the manner of Harper Lee, but as "A Thousand Splendid Suns" amply proves, this native of Kabul has more stories to tell about the land of Afghanistan." <i>Read Lawrance M. Bernabo's review</i><br><br> <b>Amanda Richards</b>: "There are parts of this book that will have grown men surreptitiously blotting the tears that are on the verge of overflowing their ducts, and by the time you get to the middle, you won&#x2019;t be able to put it down. Hosseini's simple but richly descriptive prose makes for an engrossing read, and in my opinion, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is among the best I have ever read. This is definitely not one to be missed." <i>Read Amanda Richards's review</i><br><br> <b>N. Durham</b>: "All that being said, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a bit more enjoyable than Hosseini&#x2019;s previous "The Kite Runner", and once again he manages to give we readers another glimpse of a world that we know little about but frequently condemn and discard. However, if you were one of the many that for some reason absolutely loved "The Kite Runner", chances are that you'll love this as well." <i>Read N. Durham's review</i><br><br> <b>John Kwok</b>: "Khaled Hosseini's "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a genuine instant literary classic, and one destined to be remembered as one of 2007's best novels.

But I was given the chance to read A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini (author of The Kite Runner), so I decided to try something out of my normal genre. I am *so* glad I did. This is a stunning and moving novel of life and love in Afghanistan over a 30 year period." <i>Read Thomas Duff's review</i><br><br> <b>Charles Ashbacher</b>: "This book manages to simultaneously capture the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years and how women are treated in conservative Islamic societies.... In many ways it is a sad book, your heart goes out to these two women in their hopeless struggle to have a decent life with a brutal man in an unforgiving, intolerant society." <i>Read Charles Ashbacher's review</i><br><br> <b>W. Boudville</b>: "Hosseini presents a piognant view into the recent tortured decades of the Afghan experience. From the 1970s, under a king, to the Soviet takeover, to the years of resistance. And then the rise and fall of the Taliban. An American reader will recognise many of the main political events. But to many Americans, Afghanistan and its peoples and religion remain an opaque and troubling mystery." <i>Read W. Boudville's review</i><br><br> <b>Mark Baker</b>: "I tend to read plot heavy books, so this character study was a definite change of pace for me. I found the first half slow going at times, mainly because I knew where the story was going. Once I got into the second half, things really picked up. The ending was very bittersweet. I couldn't think of a better way to end it." <i>Read Mark Baker's review</i><br><br> <b>Grady Harp</b>: "Hosseini takes us behind those walls for forty some years of Afghanistan's bloody history and while he does not spare us any of the descriptions of the terror that continues to besiege that country, he does offer us a story that speaks so tenderly about the fragile beauty of love and devotion and lasting impression people make on people." <i>Read Grady Harp's review</i><br><br> <b>Robert P. Beveridge</b>: "When I was actively reading it, the pages kept turning, and more than once I found myself foregoing food or sleep temporarily to get in just one more chapter. When I had put it down, however, I felt no particular compulsion to pick it back up again. It's a good book, and a relatively well-written one, but it's not a great book. Enjoyable without leaving a lasting impression." <i>Read Robert P. Beveridge's review</i><br><br> <b>B. Marold</b>: "While the events in Afghanistan and the wider world create a familiar framework for the stories of these two women, it is nothing more than a framework. The warp and weft of everyday life, and the interaction of the two women and their close relatives is the heartbeat of the story." <i>Read B. Marold's review</i><br><br> <b>Daniel Jolley</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has written a majestic, sweeping, emotionally powerful story that provides the reader with a most telling window into Afghan society over the past thirty-odd years. It's also a moving story of friendship and sacrifice, giving Western readers a rare glimpse into the suffering and mistreatment of Afghan women that began long before the Taliban came to power." <i>Read Daniel Jolley's review</i><br><br> </p><b> Khaled Hosseini </b> is one of most widely read and beloved novelists in the world, with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;ten million copies sold in the United States of <i>The Kite Runner</i> and <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i>, and more than thirty-eight million copies sold worldwide in&nbsp;more than&nbsp;seventy countries.

He is&nbsp;the science correspondent for CBS's <i>This Morning</i> and host of the radio programs <i>Science Fantastic</i> and <i>Explorations in Science</i>.Houdini believed that telepathy was impossible. But science is proving<br>Houdini wrong.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telepathy is now the subject of intense research at universities around<br>the world, where scientists have already been able to use advanced sensors to<br>read individual words, images, and thoughts in a person&#x2019;s brain. This could<br>alter the way we communicate with stroke and accident victims who are<br>&#x201c;locked in&#x201d; their bodies, unable to articulate their thoughts except through<br>blinks. But that&#x2019;s just the start. Telepathy might also radically change the way<br>we interact with computers and the outside world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in a recent &#x201c;Next 5 in 5 Forecast,&#x201d; which predicts five revolutionary<br>developments in the next five years, IBM scientists claimed that we will<br>be able to mentally communicate with computers, perhaps replacing the<br>mouse and voice commands. This means using the power of the mind to call<br>people on the phone, pay credit card bills, drive cars, make appointments,<br>create beautiful symphonies and works of art, etc. The possibilities are endless,<br>and it seems that everyone&#x2014; from computer giants, educators, video<br>game companies, and music studios to the Pentagon&#x2014; is converging on this<br>technology.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True telepathy, found in science-fiction and fantasy novels, is not possible<br>without outside assistance. As we know, the brain is electrical. In general,<br>anytime an electron is accelerated, it gives off electromagnetic radiation. The<br>same holds true for electrons oscillating inside the brain, which broadcasts<br>radio waves. But these signals are too faint to be detected by others, and<br>even if we could perceive these radio waves, it would be difficult to make<br>sense of them. Evolution has not given us the ability to decipher this collection<br>of random radio signals, but computers can. Scientists have been able<br>to get crude approximations of a person&#x2019;s thoughts using EEG scans. Subjects<br>would put on a helmet with EEG sensors and concentrate on certain<br>pictures&#x2014; say, the image of a car. The EEG signals were then recorded for<br>each image and eventually a rudimentary dictionary of thought was created,<br>with a one- to- one correspondence between a person&#x2019;s thoughts and the EEG<br>image. Then, when a person was shown a picture of another car, the computer<br>would recognize the EEG pattern as being from a car.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of EEG sensors is that they are noninvasive and quick.<br>You simply put a helmet containing many electrodes onto the surface of the<br>brain and the EEG can rapidly identify signals that change every millisecond.<br>But the problem with EEG sensors, as we have seen, is that electromagnetic<br>waves deteriorate as they pass through the skull, and it is difficult to locate<br>their precise source. This method can tell if you are thinking of a car or a<br>house, but it cannot re- create an image of the car. That is where Dr. Jack Gallant&#x2019;s<br>work comes in.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>VIDEOS OF THE MIND</b><br><br>The epicenter for much of this research is the University of California at<br>Berkeley, where I received my own Ph.D. in theoretical physics years ago. I<br>had the pleasure of touring the laboratory of Dr. Gallant, whose group has<br>accomplished a feat once considered to be impossible: videotaping people&#x2019;s<br>thoughts. &#x201c;This is a major leap forward reconstructing internal imagery. We<br>are opening a window into the movies in our mind,&#x201d; says Gallant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited his laboratory, the first thing I noticed was the team of<br>young, eager postdoctoral and graduate students huddled in front of their<br>computer screens, looking intently at video images that were reconstructed<br>from someone&#x2019;s brain scan. Talking to Gallant&#x2019;s team, you feel as though you<br>are witnessing scientific history in the making.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant explained to me that first the subject lies flat on a stretcher, which<br>is slowly inserted headfirst into a huge, state- of- the- art MRI machine, costing<br>upward of $3 million. The subject is then shown several movie clips (such<br>as movie trailers readily available on YouTube). To accumulate enough data,<br>the subject has to sit motionless for hours watching these clips, a truly arduous<br>task. I asked one of the postdocs, Dr. Shinji Nishimoto, how they found<br>volunteers who were willing to lie still for hours on end with only fragments<br>of video footage to occupy the time. He said the people in the room, the grad<br>students and postdocs, volunteered to be guinea pigs for their own research.<br>As the subject watches the movies, the MRI machine creates a 3- D image<br>of the blood flow within the brain. The MRI image looks like a vast collection<br>of thirty thousand dots, or voxels. Each voxel represents a pinpoint of neural energy, and the color of the dot corresponds to the intensity of the signal and blood flow. Red dots represent points of large neural activity, while blue dots represent points of less activity. (The final image looks very much like thousands of Christmas lights in the shape of the brain. Immediately you can see that the brain is concentrating most of its mental energy in the visual cortex, which is located at the back of the brain, while watching these videos.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant&#x2019;s MRI machine is so powerful it can identify two to three hundred distinct regions of the brain and, on average, can take snapshots that have one hundred dots per region of the brain. (One goal for future generations of MRI technology is to provide an even sharper resolution by increasing the number of dots per region of the brain.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, this 3- D collection of colored dots looks like gibberish. But after<br>years of research, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues have developed a mathematical<br>formula that begins to find relationships between certain features of a picture (edges, textures, intensity, etc.) and the MRI voxels. For example, if you look at a boundary, you&#x2019;ll notice it&#x2019;s a region separating lighter and darker areas, and hence the edge generates a certain pattern of voxels. By having subject after subject view such a large library of movie clips, this mathematical formula is refined, allowing the computer to analyze how all sorts of images are converted into MRI voxels. Eventually the scientists were able to ascertain a direct correlation between certain MRI patterns of voxels<br>and features within each picture.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the subject is then shown another movie trailer. The computer<br>analyzes the voxels generated during this viewing and re- creates a rough approximation of the original image. (The computer selects images from one hundred movie clips that most closely resemble the one that the subject just saw and then merges images to create a close approximation.) In this way, the computer is able to create a fuzzy video of the visual imagery going through your mind. Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s mathematical formula is so versatile that it can take a collection of MRI voxels and convert it into a picture, or it can do the reverse, taking a picture and then converting it to MRI voxels.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a chance to view the video created by Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s group, and it was<br>very impressive. Watching it was like viewing a movie with faces, animals,<br>street scenes, and buildings through dark glasses. Although you could not<br>see the details within each face or animal, you could clearly identify the kind<br>of object you were seeing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only can this program decode what you are looking at, it can also<br>decode imaginary images circulating in your head. Let&#x2019;s say you are asked to<br>think of the <i>Mona Lisa. </i>We know from MRI scans that even though you&#x2019;re<br>not viewing the painting with your eyes, the visual cortex of your brain will<br>light up. Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s program then scans your brain while you are thinking<br>of the <i>Mona Lisa </i>and flips through its data files of pictures, trying to find the<br>closest match. In one experiment I saw, the computer selected a picture of<br>the actress Salma Hayek as the closest approximation to the <i>Mona Lisa. </i>Of<br>course, the average person can easily recognize hundreds of faces, but the<br>fact that the computer analyzed an image within a person&#x2019;s brain and then<br>picked out this picture from millions of random pictures at its disposal is<br>still impressive.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this whole process is to create an accurate dictionary that<br>allows you to rapidly match an object in the real world with the MRI pattern<br>in your brain. In general, a detailed match is very difficult and will take years,<br>but some categories are actually easy to read just by flipping through some<br>photographs. Dr. Stanislas Dehaene of the Coll�ge de France in Paris was<br>examining MRI scans of the parietal lobe, where numbers are recognized,<br>when one of his postdocs casually mentioned that just by quickly scanning<br>the MRI pattern, he could tell what number the subject was looking at. In<br>fact, certain numbers created distinctive patterns on the MRI scan. He notes,<br>&#x201c;If you take 200 voxels in this area, and look at which of them are active<br>and which are inactive, you can construct a machine-learning device that<br>decodes which number is being held in memory.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves open the question of when we might be able to have picture quality<br>videos of our thoughts. Unfortunately, information is lost when a<br>person is visualizing an image. Brain scans corroborate this. When you compare<br>the MRI scan of the brain as it is looking at a flower to an MRI scan<br>as the brain is thinking about a flower, you immediately see that the second<br>image has far fewer dots than the first. So although this technology will<br>vastly improve in the coming years, it will never be perfect. (I once read a<br>short story in which a man meets a genie who offers to create anything that<br>the person can imagine. The man immediately asks for a luxury car, a jet<br>plane, and a million dollars. At first, the man is ecstatic. But when he looks at<br>these items in detail, he sees that the car and the plane have no engines, and<br>the image on the cash is all blurred. Everything is useless. This is because our<br>memories are only approximations of the real thing.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But given the rapidity with which scientists are beginning to decode the<br>MRI patterns in the brain, will we soon be able to actually read words and<br>thoughts circulating in the mind?<br><b><br>READING THE MIND</b><br><br>In fact, in a building next to Gallant&#x2019;s laboratory, Dr. Brian Pasley and his<br>colleagues are literally reading thoughts&#x2014; at least in principle. One of the<br>postdocs there, Dr. Sara Szczepanski, explained to me how they are able to<br>identify words inside the mind.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists used what is called ECOG (electrocorticogram) technology,<br>which is a vast improvement over the jumble of signals that EEG scans<br>produce. ECOG scans are unprecedented in accuracy and resolution, since<br>signals are directly recorded from the brain and do not pass through the<br>skull. The flipside is that one has to remove a portion of the skull to place a<br>mesh, containing sixty-four electrodes in an eight-by-eight grid, directly on<br>top of the exposed brain.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily they were able to get permission to conduct experiments with<br>ECOG scans on epileptic patients, who were suffering from debilitating seizures.<br>The ECOG mesh was placed on the patients&#x2019; brains while open- brain<br>surgery was being performed by doctors at the nearby University of California<br>at San Francisco.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the patients hear various words, signals from their brains pass through<br>the electrodes and are then recorded. Eventually a dictionary is formed,<br>matching the word with the signals emanating from the electrodes in the<br>brain. Later, when a word is uttered, one can see the same electrical pattern. This correspondence also means that if one is thinking of a certain word, the<br>computer can pick up the characteristic signals and identify it.<br>With this technology, it might be possible to have a conversation that<br>takes place entirely telepathically. Also, stroke victims who are totally paralyzed<br>may be able to &#x201c;talk&#x201d; through a voice synthesizer that recognizes the<br>brain patterns of individual words.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, BMI (brain- machine interface) has become a hot field,<br>with groups around the country making significant breakthroughs. Similar<br>results were obtained by scientists at the University of Utah in 2011. They<br>placed grids, each containing sixteen electrodes, over the facial motor cortex<br>(which controls movements of the mouth, lips, tongue, and face) and<br>Wernicke&#x2019;s area, which processes information about language. The person was then asked to say ten common words, such as &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;no,&#x201d; &#x201c;hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;cold,&#x201d; &#x201c;hungry&#x201d; and &#x201c;thirsty,&#x201d; &#x201c;hello&#x201d; and &#x201c;good- bye,&#x201d; and &#x201c;more&#x201d; and &#x201c;less.&#x201d; Using a computer to record the brain signals when these words were uttered, the scientists were able to create a rough one- to- one correspondence between spoken words and computer signals from the brain.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, when the patient voiced certain words, they were able to correctly<br>identify each one with an accuracy ranging from 76 percent to 90 percent.<br>The next step is to use grids with 121 electrodes to get better resolution.<br>In the future, this procedure may prove useful for individuals suffering<br>from strokes or paralyzing illnesses such as Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease, who would<br>be able to speak using the brain- to- computer technique.<br><b><br>TYPING WITH THE MIND</b><br><br>At the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Dr. Jerry Shih has hooked up epileptic<br>patients via ECOG sensors so they can learn how to type with the mind.<br>The calibration of this device is simple. The patient is first shown a series<br>of letters and is told to focus mentally on each symbol. A computer records<br>the signals emanating from the brain as it scans each letter. As with the other<br>experiments, once this one- to- one dictionary is created, it is then a simple<br>matter for the person to merely think of the letter and for the letter to be<br>typed on a screen, using only the power of the mind.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Shih, the leader of this project, says that the accuracy of his machine<br>is nearly 100 percent. Dr. Shih believes that he can next create a machine to<br>record images, not just words, that patients conceive in their minds. This<br>could have applications for artists and architects, but the big drawback of<br>ECOG technology, as we have mentioned, is that it requires opening up<br>patients&#x2019; brains.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, EEG typewriters, because they are noninvasive, are entering<br>the marketplace. They are not as accurate or precise as ECOG typewriters,<br>but they have the advantage that they can be sold over the counter. Guger<br>Technologies, based in Austria, recently demonstrated an EEG typewriter at<br>a trade show. According to their officials, it takes only ten minutes or so for<br>people to learn how to use this machine, and they can then type at the rate<br>of five to ten words per minute.</p><h2>Gracias a Winn-dixie / Because of Winn-Dixie (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Ten-year-old India Opal Buloni describes her first summer in the town of Naomi, Florida, and all the good things that happen to her because of her big ugly dog Winn-Dixie.</p><p></p><h2>China Trade</h2><p><p>It's a city within a city, of smells, sounds, dark shops, and close-knit families; it's a world all its own.

Despite her Chinatown contacts and the hard work she puts in with her sometime partner (and sometime romantic partner) Bill Smith, Lydia's consistently behind the curve: first she doesn't know she's being followed, and then she doesn't know why or by whom; she doesn't know that the dead Golden Dragon had a close connection to Chinatown Pride, or that the dai lo of the Main Street Boys has a close connection to her; and she has no idea how many times, by how many different thieves, those porcelains have been stolen. There are so many culprits, in fact, that you may feel you're reading an Oriental remake of Murder on the Orient Express. But Rozan's fast-moving first novel presents her Asian-American cast and their world with a delicacy that goes far beyond local color. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Four centuries after its first publication, it remains one of the best-loved, most popular commentaries ever written.

Much to her annoyance, she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone, who is neither mother nor friend. Cora Carlisle, a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip, has no idea what she&#x2019;s in for. Young Louise, already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs, is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately, the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever.</p><p></p><p>For Cora, the city holds the promise of discovery that might answer the question at the core of her being, and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in this strange and bustling place she embarks on a mission of her own. And while what she finds isn&#x2019;t what she anticipated, she is liberated in a way she could not have imagined. Over the course of Cora&#x2019;s relationship with Louise, her eyes are opened to the promise of the twentieth century and a new understanding of the possibilities for being fully alive.</p><p></p><p>Drawing on the rich history of the 1920s,&#x2019;30s, and beyond&#x2014;from the orphan trains to Prohibition, flappers, &nbsp;and the onset of the Great Depression to the burgeoning movement for equal rights and new opportunities for women&#x2014;Laura Moriarty&#x2019;s <i>The Chaperone</i> illustrates how rapidly everything, from fashion and hemlines to values and attitudes, was changing at this time and what a vast difference it all made for Louise Brooks, Cora Carlisle, and others like them.</p></p><p><b>Laura Moriarty </b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Center of Everything</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Rest of Her Life</i>, and <i>While I&#x2019;m Falling</i>.&nbsp; She lives in Lawrence, Kansas.<b>One</b><p><i>The First time Cora heard the name Louise Brooks</i>, she was parked outside the Wichita Library in a Model-T Ford, waiting for the rain to stop. If Cora had been alone, unencumbered, she might have made a dash across the lawn and up the library&#x2019;s stone steps, but she and her friend Viola Hammond had spent the morning going door-to-door in their neighborhood, collecting books for the new children&#x2019;s room, and the considerable fruits of their efforts were safe and dry in four crates in the backseat. The storm, they decided, would be a short one, and they couldn&#x2019;t risk the books getting wet.</p><p>And really, Cora thought, staring out into the rain, it wasn&#x2019;t as if she had anything else to do. Her boys were already gone for the summer, both of them working on a farm outside Win?eld. In the fall, they would leave for college. Cora was still getting used to the quiet, and also the freedom, of this new era of her life. Now, long after Della left for the day, the house stayed clean, with no muddy footprints on the ?oor, and no records scattered around the phonograph. There were no squabbles over the car to mediate, no tennis matches at the club to cheer on, and no assigned essays to proofread and commend. The pantry and icebox actually stayed stocked with food without daily trips to the store. Today, with Alan at work, she had no reason to rush home at all.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we took your car and not ours,&#x201d; Viola said, adjusting her hat, which was pretty, a puffed turban with an ostrich feather curling down from the crown. &#x201c;People say closed cars are a luxury, but not on a day like this.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora gave her what she hoped was a modest smile. Not only was the car covered, it had come with an electric starter. <i>Cranking cars, no business for a lady</i>, was how the ad went, though Alan had admitted he didn&#x2019;t miss cranking either.</p><p>Viola turned, eyeing the books in the backseat. &#x201c;People were generous,&#x201d; she allowed. Viola was a decade older than Cora, her hair already gray at the temples, and she spoke with the authority of her added years. &#x201c;Mostly. You notice Myra Brooks didn&#x2019;t even open her door.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora hadn&#x2019;t noticed. She&#x2019;d been working the other side of the street. &#x201c;Maybe she wasn&#x2019;t home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the piano.&#x201d; Viola&#x2019;s eyes slid toward Cora. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t bother to stop playing when I knocked. I have to say, she&#x2019;s very good.&#x201d;</p><p>Lightning shot across the western sky, and though both women ?inched, Cora, without thinking, smiled. She&#x2019;d always loved these late-spring storms. They came on so fast, rolling in from the prairie on expanding columns of clouds, a welcome release from the day&#x2019;s building heat. An hour before, when Cora and Viola were canvassing, the sun was hot in a blue sky. Now rain fell fast enough to slice green leaves from the big oak outside the library. The lilacs trembled and tossed.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think she&#x2019;s a tiresome snob?&#x201d;</p><p>Cora hesitated. She didn&#x2019;t like to gossip, but she could hardly count Myra Brooks as a friend. And they&#x2019;d been to how many suffrage meetings together? Had marched together in the street? Yet if she passed Myra today on Douglas Avenue, Cora wouldn&#x2019;t get so much as a hello. Still, she never got the feeling that it was snobbery as much as Myra simply not registering her existence, and there was a chance it was nothing personal. Myra Brooks didn&#x2019;t seem to look at anyone, Cora had noticed, not unless she was the one speaking, watching for the impression she made. And yet, of course, everyone looked at her. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful woman Cora had ever seen in person: she had pale skin, ?awless, and large, dark eyes, and then all that thick, dark hair. She was certainly a talented speaker&#x2014;her voice was never shrill, and her enunciations were clear. But everyone knew it was Myra&#x2019;s looks that had made her a particularly good spokeswoman for the Movement, a nice antidote to the newspapers&#x2019; idea of what a suffragist looked like. And you could tell she was intelligent, cultured. She was supposed to know everything about music, the works of all the famous composers. She certainly knew how to charm. Once, when she was at the podium, she had looked down at Cora, right into her eyes, and smiled as if they were friends.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really know her,&#x201d; Cora said. She looked back out through the blurred windshield, at people ducking out from a streetcar, running for cover. Alan had taken a streetcar to work, so she could have the Ford.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll inform you. Myra Brooks is a tiresome snob.&#x201d; Viola turned to Cora with a little smile, the ostrich plume grazing her chin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you the latest example: she just sent a note to the secretary of our club. Apparently, Madame Brooks is looking for someone to accompany one of her daughters to New York this summer. The older one, Louise, got into some prestigious dance school there, but she&#x2019;s only ?fteen. Myra actually wants one of us to go with her. For over a month!&#x201d; Viola seemed pleasantly outraged, her cheeks rosy, her eyes bright. &#x201c;I mean, really! I don&#x2019;t know what she&#x2019;s thinking. That we&#x2019;re the help? That one of us will be her Irish nanny?&#x201d; She frowned and shook her head. &#x201c;Most of us have progressive husbands, but I can&#x2019;t imagine any one of them would spare a wife for over a month so she could go to New York City, of all places. Myra herself is too busy to go. She has to lie around the house and play the piano.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora pursed her lips. <i>New York</i>. She felt the old ache right away. &#x201c;Well. I suppose she has other children to look after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, she does, but that&#x2019;s not it. She doesn&#x2019;t take care of them. They&#x2019;re motherless, those children. Poor Louise goes to Sunday school by herself. The instructor is Edward Vincent, and he picks her up and takes her home every Sunday. I heard that right from his wife. Myra and Leonard are alleged Presbyterians, but you never see them at church, do you? They&#x2019;re too sophisticated, you see. They don&#x2019;t make the other children go either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That speaks well of the daughter, that she makes the effort to go on her own.&#x201d; Cora cocked her head. &#x201c;I wonder if I&#x2019;ve ever seen her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Louise? Oh, you would remember. She doesn&#x2019;t look like anyone else. Her hair is black like Myra&#x2019;s, but perfectly straight like an Oriental&#x2019;s, and she wears it in a Buster Brown.&#x201d; Viola gestured just below her ears. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t bob it. She had it cut like that when they moved here years ago. It&#x2019;s too short and severe, a horrible look, in my opinion, not feminine at all. But even so, I have to say, she&#x2019;s a very pretty girl. Prettier than her mother.&#x201d; She smiled, leaning back in her seat. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s some justice in that, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora tried to picture this black-haired girl, more beautiful than her beautiful mother. Her gloved hand moved to the back of her own hair, which was dark, but not remarkably so. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t perfectly straight, though it looked presentable, she hoped, pinned up under her straw hat. Cora had been told she had a kind, pleasant face, and that she was lucky to have good teeth. But that had never added up to striking beauty. And now she was thirty-six.</p><p>&#x201c;My own girls are threatening to cut their hair,&#x201d; Viola said with a sigh. &#x201c;Foolish. This bobbing business is just a craze. When it&#x2019;s over, everyone who followed the lemmings over the cliff will need years to grow their hair out. A lot of people won&#x2019;t hire girls with bobbed hair. I try to warn them, but they won&#x2019;t listen. They just laugh at me. And they have their own language, their own secret code for them and their friends. Do you know what Ethel called me the other day? She called me a <i>wurp</i>.That&#x2019;s not a real word. But when I tell them that, they laugh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just trying to rattle you,&#x201d; Cora said with a smile. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sure they won&#x2019;t really bob their hair.&#x201d; Really, it seemed unlikely. The magazines were full of short-haired girls, but in Wichita, bobs were still a rarity. &#x201c;I do think it looks good on some girls,&#x201d; Cora said shyly. &#x201c;Short hair, I mean. And it must feel cooler, and lighter. Just think&#x2014;you could throw all your hairpins away.&#x201d;</p><p>Viola looked at her, eyebrows raised.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; Cora again touched the back of her neck. &#x201c;I might if I were younger.&#x201d;</p><p>The rain was coming down faster, rapping hard on the roof of the car.</p><p>Viola crossed her arms. &#x201c;Well, if my girls do cut their hair, I can tell you now, it won&#x2019;t be so they can throw away hairpins. They&#x2019;ll do it to be provocative. To look provocative. That&#x2019;s what passes for fashion these days. That&#x2019;s what young people are all about now.&#x201d; She sounded suddenly stricken, more confused than indignant. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it, Cora. I raised them to have propriety. But both of them are suddenly obsessed with showing the world their knees. They roll their skirts up after they leave the house. I can tell by the waistbands. I know they defy me. They roll their stockings down, too.&#x201d; She gazed out into the rain, lines branching beneath her eyes. &#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t know is why, what&#x2019;s going on in their little heads, why they don&#x2019;t care about the message they&#x2019;re sending. When I was young, I never felt the need to show the general public my knees.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Those two cause me more grief than all four of my boys. I envy you, Cora. You&#x2019;re lucky to only have sons.&#x201d;</p><p>Maybe, Cora thought. She did love the very maleness of the twins, their robust health and con?dence, their practical taste in clothing, their easy reconciliations after heated quarrels. Earle was smaller and quieter than Howard, but even he seemed capable of forgetting all worries when he held a racquet or a bat. She loved that they had both wanted to work on a farm, seeing it as an adventure in country living and physical labor, though she also worried they had no idea how much labor they&#x2019;d signed on for. And she knew she <i>had</i> been lucky with her sons, and not just in the way that Viola meant. The Hendersons next door had a son just four years older than the twins, but those few years had made all the difference&#x2014;Stuart Henderson had been killed in early 1918, ?ghting in France. Four years later, Cora was still stunned. For her, Stuart Henderson would always be a gangly adolescent, smiling and waving from his bike at her own boys, who were small then, still in short pants. Really, being lucky with sons seemed a matter of timing.</p><p>But whatever Viola said, Cora thought she might have fared just as well with daughters. She would have been good with girls, perhaps, using the right combination of instruction and understanding. Maybe Viola was just going about it the wrong way.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Cora. Something is wrong with this new generation. They don&#x2019;t care about anything important. When we were young, we wanted the vote. We wanted social reform. Girls today just want to . . . walk around practically naked so they can be stared at. It&#x2019;s as if they have no other calling.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora could hardly disagree. It really was shocking, how much skin girls were showing these days. And she wasn&#x2019;t some old prude or Mrs. Grundy; she was fairly sure she wasn&#x2019;t a <i>wurp</i>, though she didn&#x2019;t know what that meant either. Cora had been pleased when the hemlines moved up to nine inches from the ankle. Some leg showed, true, but that change seemed sensible: no more skirts trailing in the mud and bringing typhoid or who knows what into the house. And calf length was far preferable to the ridiculous hobble skirts that she herself had stumbled around in, all for the sake of fashion, not so long ago. Still, girls were now sporting skirts so short that their knees showed every time the wind blew, and there was no practical reason for that. Viola was right: a girl who wore a skirt that short just wanted to be looked at, and looked at <i>in that way</i>. Cora had even seen a few women her own age showing their knees, right here in Wichita, and really, in her opinion, these half-naked matrons looked especially vulgar.</p><p>Viola looked at her brightly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the reasons I&#x2019;m joining the Klan.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora turned. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Klan. Ku Klux. They sent a representative to the club last week. I wish you would have been there, Cora. They&#x2019;re very interested in women joining up, holding positions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they are,&#x201d; Cora murmured. &#x201c;We vote.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a cynic. They were much more speci?c than that. They know that there are serious women&#x2019;s issues at hand, and that women need to be in the ?ght.&#x201d; The ostrich feather bobbed as she spoke. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re against all this modernization, all these outside in?uences on our youth. They&#x2019;re interested in racial purity, of course, but they&#x2019;re just as interested in teaching personal purity for young women. We do need to keep our race pure, and Good Lord, we need to keep it going. My brother-in-law says a veritable takeover is coming, and it&#x2019;s all being planned in the basement of the Vatican. That&#x2019;s the real reason Catholics have so many children, you know, and meanwhile, our people have one or two or none at . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Viola trailed off. She rolled her lips in. It took Cora a moment to understand.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Viola said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean you. Your situation is different.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora waved her off. The twins were what she had. But both she and Viola were silent for a while, and there was only the tapping rain.</p><p>&#x201c;In any case,&#x201d; Viola said ?nally, &#x201c;I think it would be good for the girls. Good, moral people to mix with.&#x201d;</p><p>Cora swallowed, feeling short of breath. She had been wearing a corset day in, day out, for so many years that she rarely registered it as a discomfort. It seemed a part of her body. But in moments of distress, such as now, she was aware of her constricted rib cage. She would have to choose her words carefully. She could not come across as personally concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said, her voice breezy, not betraying her in any way. &#x201c;Oh,Viola. The Klan? They wear those white gowns, those hoods with the spooky eyeholes.&#x201d; She ?uttered her gloved hands. &#x201c;And they have wizards and grand wizards, and bon?res.&#x201d; Even as she smiled, she glanced into Viola&#x2019;s small blue eyes, analyzing what she saw there. She had to consider her options, her best route to success. Viola was older, but Cora was richer.

At thirty-two he was Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s wartime coordinator for Latin America. As New York&#x2019;s four-term governor he set national standards in education, the environment, and urban policy. The charismatic face of liberal Republicanism, Rockefeller championed civil rights and health insurance for all. Three times he sought the presidency&#x2014;arguably in the wrong party. At the Republican National Convention in San Francisco in 1964, locked in an epic battle with Barry Goldwater, Rockefeller denounced extremist elements in the GOP, a moment that changed the party forever. But he could not wrest the nomination from the Arizona conservative, or from Richard Nixon four years later. In the end, he had to settle for two dispiriting years as vice president under Gerald Ford.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>On His Own Terms,</i> Richard Norton Smith re-creates Rockefeller&#x2019;s improbable rise to the governor&#x2019;s mansion, his politically disastrous divorce and remarriage, and his often surprising relationships with presidents and political leaders from FDR to Henry Kissinger.

From the deadly 1971 prison uprising at Attica and unceasing battles with New York City mayor John Lindsay to his son&#x2019;s unsolved disappearance (and the grisly theories it spawned), the punitive drug laws that bear his name, and the much-gossiped-about circumstances of his death, Nelson Rockefeller&#x2019;s was a life of astonishing color, range, and relevance. <i>On His Own Terms, </i>a masterpiece of the biographer&#x2019;s art, vividly captures the soaring optimism, polarizing politics, and inner turmoil of this American Original.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>On His Own Terms</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;[An] enthralling biography . . .

Rockefeller<br><br>1<br><br>The headlines were predictable. croesus captured. beauty to wed wealth. son of richest man in the world gives up church and goes in for dancing to win miss aldrich. Americans in the autumn of 1901 were both fascinated and repelled by the pending alliance between the world&#x2019;s greatest fortune and the country&#x2019;s dominant lawmaker. The site of the wedding was never in doubt. Although the bride expressed her preference for a modest ceremony in a small Warwick church, and the groom would have been perfectly happy to plight his troth before a handful of witnesses in New York&#x2019;s Little Church Around the Corner, the choice didn&#x2019;t rest with Abby Greene Aldrich or John D. Rockefeller, Jr. In the Aldrich household, senatorial privilege governed; unmitigated by senatorial courtesy, it reserved all questions of importance to the imperious figure popularly labeled &#x201c;the General Manager of the United States.&#x201d;<br><br>Virtually forgotten today, for twenty years straddling the end of the nineteenth century, Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich pulled the nation&#x2019;s financial strings in tandem with Wall Street confederates like J. P. Morgan and Paul Warburg. &#x201c;He was so much the man of power that he never thought about his power,&#x201d; wrote Aldrich&#x2019;s official biographer. &#x201c;It was natural to him, like breathing air.&#x201d; Much the same would be said of the senator&#x2019;s grandson and namesake, who emulated his appetite for command, his chronic restlessness, and his unabashed delight in art at once spiritual and sensual. &#x201c;Most people don&#x2019;t know what they want!&#x201d; Aldrich grumbled. This was not a criticism frequently directed at the senior senator from Rhode Island. The recent assassination of President William McKinley, long a champion of economic protectionism, may have been grim news indeed for like-�minded Republicans like Aldrich. Yet the death of a president, however untimely, could not be allowed to interfere with the wedding of Abby Aldrich four weeks later.<br><br>If anything, uncertainty about McKinley&#x2019;s swashbuckling successor, Theodore Roosevelt, lent a note of urgency to the invitations Aldrich dispatched to his Capitol Hill colleagues. &#x201c;Come right to Warwick and stay,&#x201d; he told one. &#x201c;We will have a committee [meeting] right away after. There are a number of things I want to talk to you about.&#x201d; The new president, precluded by the requirements of public mourning from attending the nuptials, was nonetheless careful to solicit senatorial counsel as he composed his first, defining message to Congress. Aldrich took such deference as his due. As a child he had come to see himself among the elect, a status reinforced by his mother&#x2019;s claims of descent from New England patriarchs John Winthrop and Roger Williams. While still a newcomer to the Providence City Council, Aldrich had resolved to build a great country seat on the west shore of Narragansett Bay at Warwick. Even now, architects were drawing plans for a seventy-�room ch�teau, serviced by a two-�hundred-�yard private railroad laid down to muffle the clatter of tradesmen making deliveries. The parklike setting already boasted a large stone teahouse, in the elegant ballroom of which Abby and John would exchange their vows.<br><br>None of the several hundred invited guests who made their way there on the morning of October 9, 1901, by steamer or special streetcar could fail to be impressed by the waterfront estate Aldrich called Indian Oaks and muckraking journalists made notorious as the House That Sugar Built. Its owner, the son of a millworker from Foster, Rhode Island, had traveled an improbable road in his sixty years. Before his tenth birthday, Aldrich passed up a visiting circus and, with the money saved, purchased the self-�improving volume A Tinker&#x2019;s Son, or, I&#x2019;ll Be Somebody Yet. At seventeen, he landed a job as a wholesale grocer&#x2019;s clerk in the state capital of Providence. Attending evening lectures at a local lyceum to compensate for a meager formal education, Aldrich paid special attention to the rules of debate and parliamentary procedure. The attack on Fort Sumter interrupted his bookkeeping labors, but only briefly; a bout of typhoid fever earned him a discharge from the Tenth Rhode Island Volunteers garrisoning wartime Washington.<br><br>Sickened by the possibility that he might remain one of the &#x201c;dumb driven cattle&#x201d; constituting the bulk of humanity, Aldrich returned to Providence in the autumn of 1862. He began courting Abby Pearce Chapman, a Mayflower descendant to whom he confided a fierce resolution to achieve, &#x201c;willingly or forcibly wrested from a selfish world Success! Counted as the mass count it, by dollars and cents!&#x201d; The ambitious clerk dreaded anonymity only slightly less than the soul-�killing drudgery of the ledger book. Within a year of their 1866 marriage, Nelson and Abby welcomed a son, christened Nelson Jr. The boy&#x2019;s death at the age of four devastated his parents. But it was the father who fled to the Old World, leaving Abby to console herself as he applied the healing balm of art.<br><br>At the Parthenon (&#x201c;the most sublime of all temples or churches&#x201d;), Aldrich was nearly overcome by the urge to prostrate himself on the marble pavement. Rejecting the stern theology of his New England fathers, Aldrich found inspiration in the parallel universe of artistic and literary expression. Denied creative talent, Aldrich was frustrated a second time when his hopes of becoming a great orator, a modern-�day Cicero, went glimmering. Politics beckoned. Elected to the Providence City Council in 1869, Aldrich served simultaneously as president of the city&#x2019;s Board of Trade and the First National City Bank. After making his peace with the Republican boss of Rhode Island, General Charles Brayton, he won a seat in the state legislature. His subsequent ascent to the Speaker&#x2019;s chair foreshadowed two terms in the national House of Representatives and three decades as a senatorial powerhouse.<br><br>His reliance on government as an engine of democratic capitalism placed Aldrich in the nationalistic camp of Alexander Hamilton, a financial wizard rejected by the very people whose democratic experiment he capitalized. Hamilton believed that only by linking the interests of the state &#x201c;in an intimate connection&#x201d; with citizens of great wealth could the success of the young republic be assured. For Nelson Aldrich, the line demarking self-�interest from the public good was indistinct, if not invisible. From an early age, Aldrich the self-�made aristocrat entertained visions of grandeur centered on Warwick Neck. Lacking the cash to realize them, the freshman senator and his growing family made do with a suite of rooms in a Washington hotel, supplemented by rented houses in Providence. Eventually there would be eleven Aldrich children, eight of whom survived infancy. These included a daughter born in October 1874 and named for her mother. As the elder Abby faded under the strain of repeated pregnancies and the physical and emotional distance imposed by Nelson&#x2019;s political pursuits, the second Abby came to fill the void in her father&#x2019;s life. Belying his reactionary image, Nelson Aldrich was a thoroughgoing progressive when it came to educating women. Thus his daughter began her formal schooling with a Quaker governess, precursor to Miss Abbott&#x2019;s School for Young Ladies in Providence, at which modern languages, ancient history, and art lent ballast to the traditional curriculum of dancing, gymnastics, and edifying verse.<br><br>Young Abby became a voracious reader, with a versatility extending far beyond the classroom. She enjoyed baseball as much as needlework. Tutored by her father, who entered the Senate when she was seven years old, Abby became proficient at poker, bridge, and games played for much higher stakes. She observed his quiet domination of the Philosophy Club, a powerful quartet of senators that convened on the front porch in Warwick to deal cards and determine the national agenda. In modern parlance a workhorse, not a show horse, even as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Aldrich held no press conferences, published no manifestos, submitted to no interviews. Trained observers like the painter Anders Zorn found him inscrutable. &#x201c;Of all the sitters I ever had Senator Aldrich is the most difficult because of the expression of his eyes,&#x201d; said Zorn. &#x201c;It is so hard to get.&#x201d;<br><br>By his stubborn refusal to concede public accountability, as in his social Darwinist preference for the strong over the weak, Aldrich mirrored his closemouthed counterpart in business John D. Rockefeller, Sr. (who famously declined to answer critics by muttering, &#x201c;Let the world wag&#x201d;). Each man had escaped youthful poverty with the aid of a motivating mother and his own towering ambition. Each invited caricature at odds with his complex motivations and personal magnetism. Certainly Aldrich, a muscular six-�footer with dark hunter&#x2019;s eyes and a florid mustache, cut an imposing figure in Capitol Hill cloakrooms, where a brisk nod or sidelong glance could fix the fate of legislation. At home in the shadows, according to one lobbyist, &#x201c;He made no noise . . . but when we saw him moving about, and whispering to Senator Allison, and just giving a wink to Senator Hale and Senator Platt of Connecticut, we knew our cake was dough.&#x201d;<br><br>Aldrich&#x2019;s domestic table was less amply furnished, his official salary of $5,000 being insufficient to maintain two residences and raise eight children. Too proud to live off his wife&#x2019;s money, in 1892 the senator announced his retirement from politics. A group of Rhode Island businessmen, grateful for his help in consolidating a tangle of rival street railway companies in Providence, offered to make him president of the United Traction and Electric Company. This set off boardroom alarms in the American Sugar Refining Company, the so-�called Sugar Trust, whose economic interests had never been far from the senator&#x2019;s heart. Now Big Sugar filled the Aldrich wallet, beginning with $100,000 from chief lobbyist John E. Searles, Jr. As events would demonstrate, this was a mere down payment on Aldrich&#x2019;s continued services. All thoughts of resignation from the Senate were buried under $5 million of Searles&#x2019;s money, used by Aldrich to capitalize the fledgling transit company. This, in turn, laid the foundation for a personal fortune exceeding $15 million. His sudden prosperity enabled Aldrich to purchase a mansion in the elegant College Hill neighborhood of Providence and to realize his boyish dream of possessing an estate grand enough for the Philosophy Club, if less garish than the oceanside palaces of Newport.<br><br>Each summer, the Aldriches gathered at Warwick Neck to bask in nautical breezes and navigate the choppy currents of Narragansett Bay. Besides sailing lessons, the patriarch imparted to Abby his unconcealed joy in acquiring European masters, Persian rugs, and Chippendale chairs. (One of the senator&#x2019;s proudest legislative achievements was the elimination of import duties on art and antiquities, thereby accelerating the Yankee plunder of Old World collectibles.) By the time she made her social debut in the autumn of 1893, nineteen-�year-�old Abby Aldrich was a beguiling compound of majesty and mirth. Tall and bosomy, her Gibson girl figure topped by luxuriant chestnut hair, she was outgoing, free of prejudice, and exuberantly original, with a low, slightly nasal voice that erupted in frequent laughter. Her square jaw and thick blade of a nose marked Abby as a true Aldrich. If these rendered her appearance more vivid than beautiful, they did nothing to diminish the line of suitors who bestowed on her no fewer than fifty-�two bouquets. Nor was it difficult to see why: boasting confidence to spare, Abby exuded the intuitive sympathy and warmth that make a man feel more of a man.<br><br>Denied access to power by a society that placed women on pedestals to avoid dealing with them as equals, Abby channeled her political energies into such respectable substitutes as the Providence Day Nursery and the Dorrance Home for Aged Colored Women. She enjoyed an active social life. No dinner of the period was complete without a Welsh rarebit; in her diary, each was &#x201c;the best I have ever tasted in all my life.&#x201d; On foreign travels, everything was &#x201c;marvelous . . . I simply can&#x2019;t understand it,&#x201d; Abby wrote of her less impressionable companions. &#x201c;They just don&#x2019;t enjoy anything so much as I do.&#x201d; (An indiscriminate use of superlatives, topped by the all-�purpose &#x201c;Faa-�bu-�lous,&#x201d; would reappear in the speech of her son Nelson.)<br><br>One evening in November 1894, Abby went to a party at the home of a friend whose father was a trustee of Brown University. There she met a shy, socially awkward Brown sophomore who had never been to a &#x201c;round dance&#x201d; out of fear it might offend his deeply religious mother. Simply attending the party was, for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., an act of muffled rebellion. He did not ask Abby to dance, fearing that he might slip and fall on the highly polished dance floor. Miss Aldrich compensated for his timidity. Distilling the pattern of their lives together, John would recall, &#x201c;She treated me as if I had all the savoir faire in the world, and her confidence did me a lot of good.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br><br>If Abby Aldrich was her father&#x2019;s daughter, the youth Brown classmates called Johnny Rock was emphatically his mother&#x2019;s son. All his life he insisted that there could be but one John D. Rockefeller; to the end of his days he was known as Junior, Mr. Junior to family retainers. The struggle for self, intensified by spiritual perfectionism, left him physically vulnerable and emotionally stunted. Such was the inheritance bequeathed her only son by Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the deacon&#x2019;s daughter with the blood of New England abolitionists in her veins. An early advocate of equal rights for black Americans, she was just as outspoken in promoting education and votes for women. At Cleveland High School, her valedictorian&#x2019;s address was entitled &#x201c;I Can Paddle My Own Canoe.&#x201d;<br><br>After 1859, Laura taught school and let herself be courted by John D. Rockefeller, a stone-�faced high school classmate staked to the commission merchant business with $1,000 of personal savings and an equal amount advanced him&#x2014;�at 10 percent interest&#x2014;�by his hedonistic father, William Avery Rockefeller. The elder Rockefeller had first appeared in the countryside around Richford, New York, in 1835, displaying a slate chalked with the statement &#x201c;I am deaf and dumb.&#x201d; Among those taken in by his act was red-�haired Eliza Davison, who in twenty-�four unremarkable years had never done an imprudent deed&#x2014;�until she defied her father and wed the charismatic peddler in February 1837. Economic uncertainty, sexual fecklessness, and public humiliation were her reward. Cayuga (&#x201c;Land of Superior Cunning&#x201d;) County seemed tailor-�made for &#x201c;Devil Bill&#x201d; Rockefeller, a charming scoundrel and self-�styled &#x201c;botanic physician,&#x201d; whose phony cancer cures were less embarrassing to Eliza than his habit of impregnating housemaids.<br><br>After installing a girlfriend named Nancy Brown as his &#x201c;housekeeper,&#x201d; in two years the con man fathered four children between his emotionally battered wife and his mistress. In 1849, a hired girl in nearby Moravia accused him of rape. The case never went to court. Instead, Rockefeller moved his legitimate family to the village of Owego. Then he took to the road. Abandoned for months at a time, Eliza and her youngsters lived precariously on credit extended by sympathetic merchants. Youthful insecurity bred in her second child, John Davison, an adult need, bordering on ...</p><h2>Hegel: The Essential Writings</h2><p>Hegel&#39;s major works; dialectic; metaphysics; science; experience; philosophic truth; Absolute Spirit.</p><p><strong>Frederick Beiser</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Syracuse University.

As Katherine O'Connell turned toward the sound, her deep blue eyes sparkled with excitement. <br> "Ten minutes!" she exclaimed to her little sister Tina. "Ten more minutes, and Grandpa and Grandma will be here!" <br> As though she could speed up the train's arrival, Kate hurried to the edge of the platform. Leaning forward, she tried to see around a building. The Antlers Hotel blocked her view. <br> In that last week of May 1907, Mama's parents were coming all the way from Sweden. Ever since knowing the time of arrival, Kate had waited for this moment. "If all goes well, we'll be on the midday train," their letter said. <br> <i>If all goes well</i>, Kate thought now, as she had many times before. <i>All the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Halfway across America. Would Grandpa and Grandma get here safely</i>? <br> As the far-off whistle faded away, Kate walked back to her mother. Mama stood with baby Bernie in her arms. Kate's stepbrothers, thirteen-year-old Anders and nine-year-old Lars, waited nearby, each with his hair combed neatly in place. <br> Off to one side, Kate's uncle, six feet three inches tall, paced up and down the platform. <i>It's different for Ben</i>, Kate thought as she saw his troubled eyes. Kate looked forward to meeting her grandparents. Yet those grandparents were Ben's father and mother. The nineteen-year-old hadn't seen or written to them since running away from home. <br> Again the train whistle sounded, closer to Grantsburg this time. Above its cry came a high whinny. <br> Kate's stepfather moved uneasily. "Charlie Saunders got in a railroad car of horses yesterday." <br> Papa Nordstrom glanced west toward where the livery stable hid beyond the hotel. "Broncos are skittery. Out in Montana they run free till cowboys round them up for branding." <br> "And Charlie sells them?" Kate asked, curious as always. <br> Papa nodded. "Sometimes he trains them for people to ride. Other times he sells them right away. When a farmer gets the bronco he wants, he might just take it home and hitch it up with horses that are already trained." <br> As Kate watched, three men on horseback came into sight on the street leading past the hotel. With four horses trotting between them, the riders turned onto the road on the other side of the tracks. Soon they disappeared behind two potato warehouses. <br> "They're taking the back way out of town," Papa said. "If they live a few miles out of Grantsburg, they'll drive the horses home." <br> Just then Tina tugged on Kate's hand. Kate looked down at the five-year-old. "You're tired of waiting, aren't you? Let's race to the street. By the time we get back, the train will be here." <br> Tina raced off, her white-blond braids bobbing on her shoulders. Kate started after her, then remembered a thirteen-year-old was supposed to act grown up. <br> Tina kept running. At the end of the platform she jumped into the street. "I won!" she called back. "I got here first!" <br> Kate grinned and waved. Tina had won, all right. <br> Before Kate could catch up, a long sharp train whistle pierced the air. Above its call a horse screamed. <br> Kate glanced around. In the street on this side of the warehouse a large bronco reared up, a wild horse frightened by the train! <br> Suddenly Kate realized the danger. "Tina!" she called. "Come back!" <br> A second whistle drowned out her words. Again the horse reared up, pawing the air. Eyes wide, its nostrils flared in fear. As it dropped back to the ground, the bronco bolted. <br> "Runaway!" a man shouted as he tried to head the bronco off. But the black horse broke through. <br> "Tina!" Kate cried again as she raced toward her sister. Across the platform and sidewalk Kate flew. <br> Reaching Tina, Kate grabbed the little girl's arm and pulled her from the street. Seconds later the runaway thundered past. <br> As Kate dragged Tina onto the platform, she started to whimper. Kneeling down, Kate flung her arms around her. Tina's body shook with sobs. <br> Kate's arms tightened. "It's all right, Tina. It's all right! You're safe!" <br> Tina gasped. "I couldn't move!" <br> Kate understood that too. "Sometimes that happens when we're scared." <br> Even as she spoke, Kate trembled. As though it were happening again, she saw the horse with Tina in its path. <br> Then Papa Nordstrom was there, trying to comfort both of them. Next to him stood Mama. Her face was white as she clung to the baby with one arm and hugged the girls with the other. <br> "Oh, Kate!" she exclaimed. "I saw you just as you ran for Tina." Mama bit her lip, unable to go on. <br> Behind Mama, Anders and Lars and Ben appeared, looking just as scared. <br> "You're a heroine!" Lars told Kate. Freckles surrounded his serious blue eyes. <br> "Yah, sure." Anders grinned. For once, he wasn't teasing.</p><h2>The Black Unicorn (The Magic Kingdom of Landover)</h2><p>When the wizard Meeks assumes the appearance of Ben Holiday, the real Ben becomes an outcast</p><p>A year had passed since Ben Holiday bought the Magic Kingdon from the wizard, Meeks.

A young man who returns to 1940s Cajun country to teach visits a black youth on death row for a crime he didn't commit. Together they come to understand the heroism of resisting.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, September 1997</b>: In a small Cajun community in 1940s Louisiana, a young black man is about to go to the electric chair for murder. A white shopkeeper had died during a robbery gone bad; though the young man on trial had not been armed and had not pulled the trigger, in that time and place, there could be no doubt of the verdict or the penalty.<p> "I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be..." So begins Grant Wiggins, the narrator of Ernest J. Gaines's powerful exploration of race, injustice, and resistance, <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i>. If young Jefferson, the accused, is confined by the law to an iron-barred cell, Grant Wiggins is no less a prisoner of social convention. University educated, Grant has returned to the tiny plantation town of his youth, where the only job available to him is teaching in the small plantation church school. More than 75 years after the close of the Civil War, antebellum attitudes still prevail: African Americans go to the kitchen door when visiting whites and the two races are rigidly separated by custom and by law. Grant, trapped in a career he doesn't enjoy, eaten up by resentment at his station in life, and angered by the injustice he sees all around him, dreams of taking his girlfriend Vivian and leaving Louisiana forever. But when Jefferson is convicted and sentenced to die, his grandmother, Miss Emma, begs Grant for one last favor: to teach her grandson to die like a man.</p><p> As Grant struggles to impart a sense of pride to Jefferson before he must face his death, he learns an important lesson as well: heroism is not always expressed through action--sometimes the simple act of resisting the inevitable is enough. Populated by strong, unforgettable characters, Ernest J. Gaines's <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> offers a lesson for a lifetime.</p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Ancestral Journeys: The Peopling of Europe from the First Venturers to the Vikings</h2><p><p><strong>Incorporates the latest discoveries and theories from archaeology, genetics, history, and linguistics to paint a spirited history of European settlement</strong></p> Who are the Europeans and where did they come from? In recent years scientific advances have released a mass of data, turning cherished ideas upside down. The idea of migration in prehistory, so long out of favor, is back on the agenda. New advances allow us to track human movement and the spread of crops, animals, and disease, and we can see the evidence of population crashes and rises, both continent-wide and locally. Visions of continuity have been replaced with a more dynamic view of Europe&#x2019;s past, with one wave of migration followed by another, from the first human arrivals in Europe to the Vikings.<br><br> Ancient DNA links Europe to its nearest neighbors. It is not a new idea that farming was brought from the Near East, but genetics now reveal an unexpectedly complex process in which farmers arrived not in one wave, but several. Even more unexpected is the evidence that the European gene pool was stirred vigorously many times after farming had reached most of Europe. Climate change played a part in this upheaval, but so did new inventions such as the c and wheeled vehicles. Genetic and linguistic clues also enhance our understanding of the upheavals of the Migration Period, the wanderings of steppe nomads, and the adventures of the Vikings. 124 illustrations, including 59 maps</p><p>Jean Manco is a building historian who trained within an archaeological unit and applies an interdisciplinary approach to her work.

One is the family of Tobit, a virtuous man who can no longer support his wife and son because of Raguel, the quiet, devoted father of Sarah whose pact with the demon Asmodeus has left her life in tragic shambles. </p><p> Assuming human form, Raphael appears before Tabias, Tobit's devoted son, to help him retrieve his father's fortune hidden in a faraway city. Together, they embark on a miraculous journey in search of the answers to both families' prayers--a journey that is made challenging and delightful by Rapheal's artful efficiency. </p><p> <em>On the Road with the Archangel</em> is a masterful combination of fluid writing, lyrical storytelling, and ancient truth blended with modern wisdom. And beneath it all lies a subtle, glowing meditation on the nature of the Holy.</p><p> Hailed as "one of our most original storytellers" (<em>USA Today</em>), Pulitzer Prize-nominated author Frederick Buechner has written an extraordinary new novel that shines with the mystery and wonder of the divine. Drawn from the ancient apocryphal Book of Tobit, <em>On the Road with the Archangel</em> unravels the tale of a eccentric blind father and his somewhat bumbling song who journeys to seek his family's lost treasure. Narrated by the wry and resourceful archangel Raphael, Buencher's tale is a pure delight, alive with vivid characters, delightful adventures and wondrous revelations.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister. He has been a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and was honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His most recent work is <em>Beyond Words: Daily Readings in the ABC&#x2019;s of Faith</em>.</p>A fable from one of the few writers of Christian fiction to publish in the mainstream press, more recently known for his ongoing spiritual autobiography, The Sacred Journey (1982), Now and Then (1983), and Telling Secrets (1991). Buechner's fable is based on the apocryphal book of Tobit, an account of early Judaism from the second century b.c., when the Jews were an enslaved people. Raphael, one of the seven archangels, narrates Buechner's gentle story with humor and frequent asides about the nature of the Holy One. Raphael's task is to gather up prayers and carry them to God, then carry replies back if replies must be made. This results in some extraordinary passages: the prayer of a dog, for instance, to better please his master, and that of a gigantic fish, in gratitude for the mud and weeds around him. But two prayers in particular form the basis for Raphael's sojourn on Earth--and for Buechner's story. A young woman, Sarah, loves her father so dearly that she doesn't want to be married, and summons a demon who, on her seven wedding nights, kills each of seven bridegrooms. But Sarah is so filled with guilt over these deaths that she prays to God to be killed. Meanwhile, a poor blind man, Tobit, also prays for death, to relieve his miseries and to allow his family to resume normal life. He enjoins his son to undertake a perilous journey both to retrieve a fortune and to find a wife. The son, the amiable, less-than-brilliant Tobias, dutifully starts off. Raphael then joins him, securing the fortune and helping Tobias to court Sarah, devising antidotes both for demons and for the blindness of Tobit. Buechner, a Presbyterian minister, emphasizes the goodness of God, playing down suffering, playing up faith. A slight tale, though often quite charming. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They include an African man who freed himself and his family from slavery, a rebellious young woman who abandoned her abusive husband to chart her own course and a certain Mr. Washington, who was admired for his social graces but harshly criticized for his often-disastrous military strategy.</p><p>Through these lives we understand that the revolution was fought over the meaning of individual freedom, a philosophical idea that became a force for violent change.

Through his vigorous language, his mastery of archival sources and the pleasing interweave of his six carefully chosen characters, Shorto has composed a powerful polyphonic story, simultaneously grand and intimate, that makes us hear (and see and feel) the tumult of our nation&#x2019;s founding as never before.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hampton Sides, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>In the Kingdom of Ice</em></strong></p><h2>Necroscope: Defilers</h2><p>Jake Cutter is reluctantly learning how to be a Necroscope--how to use the Mobius continuum to travel instantaneously from place to place, how to talk to the dead--but dead humans don't like him much. It seems Jake's got a hitchhiker named Korath. Since Korath holds the key to the Mobius equations, Jake can't just kick him out . . . though he's certainly trying.<br><br>Jake's not sure he really wants to be a member of E-Branch, the supersecret ESP-powered organization that's dedicated to eradicating the vampire infestation of Earth. To the freewheeling, passionate Jake, the E-Branchers seem a little stuffy and hidebound--except for the lovely Liz, whom Jake wants to get to know better, body and mind. But Liz is a telepath, and if Jake's not careful, she'll find out about Korath. And that will likely be the end of Jake Cutter.<br><br>In Australia, Jake helped E-Branch destroy the aerie of the mind-master , Nephtam Malinari, one of a trio of Great Vampires who came to Earth from the vampire world. Malinari escaped and went to ground with the hideously beautiful Lady Vavara. Vavara has taken over a holy monastary on a beautiful Greek island and turned the nuns into most unholy creature with fearsome appetites for all things carnal.<br><br>Jake wants revenge against the Italian mobsters who killed the woman he loved and nearly killed him. As far as he's concerned, E-Branch can search for Malinari, Vavara, and the metamorphic Lord Szwart without him until he's satisfied his own bloodlust. But it seems vampire hunting is truly Jake's job now--the men he's trying to kill aren't men at all, but vampire spawn, hidden for two generations in human guise! To defeat them, Jake will need every weapon in a Necroscope's arsenal, including the power to all the unsleeping dead out of their moldering graves.<br></p><p>Welcome to Brian Lumley's wild world of vampires, slayers, spies, and psychics, created in his breakthrough 1986 book <i>Necroscope</i>, which introduced Harry Keogh, a man who could commune with dead people. Harry was such a skilled linguist of "deadspeak" that the British Secret Service recruited him into E-Branch, its ace paranormal unit. Harry waged a war against vampires--until the tables turned and he became another bloodsucking statistic. No longer a Necroscope (top vampire hunter), now he's a kind of advisor who beams helpful thoughts from the afterlife.<p> E-Branch's vampire woes intensify in <i>Necroscope Defilers</i>, the 12th installment of Lumley's series. A trio of seriously nasty critters are spreading their spawn on earth, but E-Branch is in crisis. Jake Cutter, the new Necroscope, is preoccupied with a personal vendetta--he's hunting down the Sicilian mobsters who killed his girlfriend. Jake also faces another minor distraction--a dead vampire named Korath is stuck inside his head, whispering evil nothings into his ear all day long. As the unholy monsters descend upon the Greek island of Krassos, it seems all hell will break loose--literally. Will Jake return to E-Branch and help annihilate this unholy scum, or is mankind doomed? </p><p> Although <i>Necroscope Defilers</i> is a little light on original plot twists, Lumley's curious country is still a land worth visiting, halfway between science fiction and dark fantasy. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Brian Lumley is the author of the bestselling Necroscope series of vampire novels.

If ready-to-wear doesn't do it for you, let Barbara Deckert teach you how to sew for your plus-size body with <em><strong>Sewing for Plus Sizes</strong></em>. She will guide you through the process of selecting designs, fabrics, and colors that flatter plus- and super-size figures. In addition, you'll get great techniques for sizing up any pattern (even those fancy designer ones!), special concerns for plus-size sewers, and lots of hints and advice make this the most useful sewing book you'll ever own.</p></p><p>Deckert, who designs and makes plus-size fashions, is a frequent contributor to Sew News, Threads, BBW, Radiance, and PACC News. She is a charter member of the Professional Association of Custom Clothiers and has over 30 years of sewing experience.Writes Deckert, "The goal of all plus-size design is to emphasize your positive attributes and modify or distract from those you feel are less desirable." Deckert is herself a plus-sized woman and a custom clothier with more than 30 years of sewing experience. Given that most clothing manufacturers have never learned to design attractive, well-fitting clothes for women who wear a size 14 or larger, the woman who wants to achieve style beyond size must sew her own clothes. This book will make that task less formidable. Illustrated with photos of plus-sized models, including the author herself, this book emphasizes analyzing pattern designs based on individual figure proportions and working effectively with fabric color and texture. Major sections of the book are devoted to tools for plus-sized sewing (including instructions for making an inexpensive personal paper-tape dress form), choosing fabric, taking measurements, "sizing-up" commercial patterns for the plus-sized figure, and modifying patterns to make clothing more comfortable and durable. Enthusiastically recommended for all public libraries with sewing and costuming collections. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Notes From Walnut Tree Farm</h2><p>Notes from Walnut Tree Farm is a collection of writing by Roger Deakin For the last six years of his life, Roger Deakin kept notebooks in which he wrote his daily thoughts, impressions, feelings and observations about and around his home, Walnut Tree Farm.

Bayless, a Dallas columnist and sportswriter who has covered the Dallas Cowboys since 1978, looks behind the publicity and Image (with a capital I) of "America's Team." Although Bayless stresses that Landry is a good person, the book is uncomplimentary toward Landry's coaching ability and the Dallas front office. Bayless's anecdotes and interviews reveal the lack of substance behind the Landry and Cowboy image. Though the author's often too-cute word play sometimes gets in the way of his narrative, overall the book gives an interesting outsider's perspective on Landry's reign in Dallas. In stark contrast to Bayless's account, Landry's autobiography perpetuates the image that has earned him the respect of so many people. From his early days in Dallas to life after his controversial firing, Landry addresses many of the same incidents Bayless discusses, but their perspectives and explanations differ significantly. Don't expect any surprising revelations. Although the Christian influence on Landry and his "aww shucks" naivete seem overemphasized, Landry shows his skill as a motivating speaker and his genuinely "nice guy" personality. The book will serve more as a motivating tool or speaker's sourcebook than it does as a behind-the-scenes view of Landry and his Cowboys. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 6/15/90. -- Martin J. Hudacs, Towanda H.S., Pa.<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Until 1989 Landry, hired in 1959, was the only coach the Dallas Cowboys had ever had. Here, writing with Lewis ( Am I Alive ), he covers the early years, when his team had an abysmal record of 0-10-1, through 1965, when Dallas finally broke even at 7-7, and the five Super Bowl appearances between 1970 and 1978, including two championships, to the descent into mediocrity in the late '80s. Discussed are Landry's debt to Paul Brown, whose coaching philosophy inspired him, Cowboys owner Clint Murchison and general manager Tex Schramm, who left him free to run the team on the field. We're told that the coach has an introverted personality, which makes many judge him cold and remote. Heavy with nostalgia and permeated with Landry's deep religious faith, the book will disappoint football fans expecting insider gossip and a suggestion of the rough-and-tumble of their sport. $160,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Winter King</h2><p>Physical description: 434p. : ill., maps ; 23 cm. Summary: Arthur is set in his true period, the Dark Ages, in this novel. It is not a story of romance, but one of political and religious strife, and war. It describes Arthur&#39;s love for Guinevere, Lancelot&#39;s arrival, the conflict between Christianity and magic, and the Saxon invasions on Britain. Subjects: Arthur King - Fiction.</p><p>Essentially this is a modern political thriller, told in flat American diction. Narrated by Derfel, an ordinary, likable man who rises through the ranks to become Arthur's friend and advisor in peace and war, the story doesn't follow the traditional patterns. Mordred is Uther's infant grandson, the legitimate king; Arthur is one of Mordred's guardians, sworn to hold the kingdom against the Saxon warlords until Mordred comes of age. Warfare is incessant. Arthur's dream of peace and unity seems unattainable. Derfel's own story--his strange origin, his love for Nimue, his worries and his triumphs--parallels Arthur's as he fights for and beside him. <p> Bernard Cornwell downplays the magic that enlivens the traditional stories, depicting it more as a combination of superstition and shrewd wits. I recommend this with reservations; though it's absorbing to read, the emphasis on battles and politics means that this will greatly appeal to some fantasy readers, but disappoint others.</p>13 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Open Mind, Open Heart: The Contemplative Dimension of the Gospel</h2><p>First published in 1986 and in print--and immensely popular--ever since, Open Mind, Open Heart, by the Trappist Monk Thomas Keating, remains one of the best introductions to a specifically Christian form of meditation. Father Keating gives the reader an overview of what contemplative prayer both is and isn&#39;t; he discusses the history of contemplative prayer in the Christian tradition and then explores step by step the process of Centering Prayer, briefly exploring its origins in the ancient church and then demonstrating its use as &#34;a sign of one&#39;s intention&#34; to surrender to God. Each chapter concludes with questions and answers that provide useful information in an informal context. Here in particular we get a sense of Keating&#39;s clarity--and his sense of humor. For example, in response to a question about the sudden experience of happiness in prayer, Keating responds, &#34;You should not take prayer too seriously. There is something playful about God. You only have to look at a penguin ... to realize that He likes to play little jokes on creatures.&#34; --Doug Thorpe</p><p>Father Thomas Keating is known throughout the world as an exponent, teacher, and writer on contemplative prayer. A Cistercian (Trappist) monk of St. Benedict&#39;s Monastery, Snowmass, Colorado, he is a founder of the Centering Prayer Movement and of Contemplative Outreach. He is the author of numerous books, particularly of the trilogy Open Mind, Open Heart; Invitation to Love; and The Mystery of Christ.

Tour.</p><p>Some authors are worth reading because of their area of expertise, even when their objectivity may be questionable. This is true of John Douglas, who follows up his <i>Mindhunter</i> with another assortment of his observations and opinions from his ex-job as the FBI's top expert on constructing behavioral profiles of criminals. This book contains several passages of interest: a detailed discussion of the <i>modus operandi</i> versus the "signature" of a murder, and how each relates to motive; thoughts on how the press and the public can be used to flush out a killer; a taxonomy of pedophiles, with a chapter on how to protect children from them; a detailed analysis of the savage sex-murder of a female Marine; a profile of the Nicole Simpson/Ron Goldman killer; and a report on how the courts are handling behavioral testimony. Always biased, often egotistical, but uniquely experienced--that's Douglas.In the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Mindhunter</i>, John Douglas, who headed the FBI's elite Investigative Support Unit, told the story of his brilliant and terrifying career tracking down some of the most heinous criminals in history. Using behavioral profiling and criminal investigative analysis to get into the head and psyche of both the criminal and victim -- to feel what they felt at the critical moment -- Douglas helped crack many high profile cases, including the Trailside Killer, the Atlanta child murders, and the Tylenol murders. Now, working again with his co-author Mark Olshaker, Douglas delves further into the criminal mind with a series of chilling new cases in <i>Journey into Darkness</i>: Follow the FBI's premier investigative profiler as he penetrates the minds and motives of the most terrifying serial killers. <p>In <i>Journey into Darkness</i>, Douglas profiles vicious serial killers, rapists, and child molesters. He is straightforward, blunt, often irreverent, and outspoken, but takes pains not to glorify any of these murderers. Some of the unique cases Douglas discusses include: </p><li> The Clairemont killer -- Six women were found stabbed to death in San Diego, three in the same apartment complex. In each case, the killer entered through an unlocked door or window in the late morning to early afternoon. A suspect was in custody, tied to one of the murders through a DNA match. Douglas was called upon to use his profiling techniques to link the other five murders to the suspect. Douglas looked at the "signature" of the killer, and found that all the murders were committed by the same man. The prosecution used the profile to force the jury to find the defendant guilty of all six murders, if they felt he was guilty of the one murder. Celophus Prince was found guilty on all counts.<br> </li><li> The schoolgirl murders -- What became Canada's "trial of the century." Several schoolgirls disappeared in 1992; their bodies were dumped several weeks later, beaten and sexually attacked. Canadian police agencies contacted the FBI for help on the case and to get a profile on the killer and, according to witnesses, his accomplice. Following the advice of the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico, Canada aired a television special entitled "The Abduction of Kristin French," allowing agent Gregg McCrary to describe the killer's profile on air. Knowing that the murderer and his accomplice would be watching, he planned to confront the unknown killer, assuring him he would be caught. Paul Bernardo was arrested on February 17, 1993, turned in by his wife and partner in crime, Karla Leanne Homolka.. The profile was dead on the money.<br> </li><li> Richmond's First Serial Murderer -- In 1987, Richmodd, Virginia, was struck by a serial rapist/murderer. The Richmond police called upon the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico to make up a profile of the perpetrator. The crimes and profile beared a remarkable resemblance to a string of burglaries, rapes and murders in Alexandria, Virginia, several years before. Agent Steve Mardigian then formulated a complex strategy that caught the killer who fit the profile to a tee. In the process he helped free a wrongly convicted man, who due to his low intelligence level, had become confused and confessed to the crime.<br> </li><li> The brutal and sadistic murder of Suzanne Marie Collins, a beautiful young Marine on the verge of a brilliant career. The culprit was caught and confessed to her killing, but his story was very different than what really happened. By delving into Sedley Alley's mind, Douglas helped bring the murderer to justice, recreating the evening from the perspective of a sadistic and angry man. Suzanne Collins' horrifying end haunts Douglas to this day.<br> Douglas delves into other cases, including Polly Klaas' abduction and murder by Richard Allen Davis, the tragedy that lead to the creation of Megan's Law; the abduction and murder of six-year-old Cassandra Lynn Hansen, who was snatched from an evening church service; and the vicious murder and sexual assault of Nancy Newman and her two daughters, eight-year-old Melissa and three-year-old Angie in Anchorage, Alaska. He also explores the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, focusing on the double homicide purely from a behavioral perspective. Douglas examines what the facts at and surrounding the crime scene told about the killer from a behavioral point of view. From Douglas's profile, the only viable suspect to date is O.J. Simpson. <p>With <i>Journey into Darkness,</i> Douglas provides more than a glimpse into the minds of serial killers; he demonstrates what a powerful weapon behavioral science has become. Profiling criminals helps not only to capture them, but also helps society understand how these predators work and what can be done to prevent them from striking again. Douglas focuses especially on pedophiles and child abductors, fully explaining what drives them, and how to keep children away from them. As he points out, "The best way to protect your children is to know your enemy." He includes eight rules for safety, a list of steps parents can take to prevent child abduction and exploitation, tips on how to detect sexual exploitation, basic rules of safety for children, and a chart, based on age, which details the safety skills children should have to protect themselves. </p><p>In his review for <i>Mindhunter</i> in <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> Dean Koontz said, "Because of his insights and the power of the material, he leaves us shaken, gripped by a quiet grief for the innocent victims and anguished by the human condition." Journey into Darkness continues this perilous trip into the psyche of the serial killer, but also offers a glimmer of hope that profiling may enable law enforcement to see the indicators of a serial killer's mind and intervene before he kills, or kills again.</p></li></p><h2>Black&#39;s Law Dictionary, Standard Ninth Edition</h2><p>For more than a century Black&#39;s has been the gold standard for the language of law.

Is it a feudal misogynist belief system that is a threat to Western values? Is it an ideology of oppression? Or, is it a religion that is as varied as Christianity; a "big tent" that includes not only bomb&#x2013;throwing ideologues, but also those committed to an authentic spirituality that embraces many of the values shared by the mainstream in Europe and America?</p><p> Why I am a Muslim is an attempt to grapple with these issues.

Because being Muslim makes me a better American (and being American makes me a better Muslim).</p></p><p><strong>Amber Frey</strong> is a certified massage therapist and lives in Fresno, California. She has a daughter, Ayiana, and a son, Justin.Any memoir based on the scandal of the moment must begin with a bang, and Frey's account of her relationship with Scott Peterson certainly does. The first seven pages race breathlessly through that first evening in November 2002 when she met Peterson on a blind date: flirting with him over dinner, splurging on gin &amp; tonics, singing some tipsy karaoke duets and returning to Peterson's hotel for what she acknowledged the next day "felt like a one-night stand." Frey then proceeds to tell the story that is doubtless familiar to throngs of gossip hounds. She describes how Peterson seduced her with his charm, charisma and apparently paternal feelings towards her young daughter. Frey also details her growing suspicions about her mysterious new boyfriend, fears that were realized when a friend finally connected the dots for her and Frey learned that Peterson was in fact married, that his pregnant wife was missing and that he was the prime suspect in the case. From there, it was just a short step to becoming a police informant and, ultimately, the key witness against Peterson at his double murder trial. Frey includes all the sordid highlights: secret tape recordings, TV makeovers, nude photographs, personal betrayals, and, always, the merciless hounding of the press. Frey portrays herself as an honest, decent young woman (the book is liberally sprinkled with Bible quotations) caught up in the whirlwind of a real-life melodrama. As forgettable as it was inevitable, mercifully short on biographical background, Frey's memoir delivers all the behind-the-scenes details that readers will want as the players in the Peterson saga quit the public stage. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We are evolutionarily designed to fast, and the body knows how to do it very well. Fasting allows the body and all its systems to rest, purify, and heal. During a fast, the body enters the same cleansing and healing cycle it normally enters during sleep. As a fast progresses, the body consumes everything that is not essential to bodily functioning--including bacteria, viruses, fibroid tumors, waste products in the blood, buildup around the joints, and stored fat--and the mind and heart release their toxic buildup as well. As Stephen Harrod Buhner reveals, in order to be truly transformed, you must first empty yourself. <br> <br>Offering step-by-step guidelines to fully prepare yourself for a deep fast, Buhner explores what to expect during and after spiritual, emotional, and physical fasting and detoxification. He details the necessary dietary and mental preparations leading up to your fast, what you can and can&#x2019;t do during a fast, and how to end your fast. He also explains how to plan the length of your fast and how to choose between a water fast, a juice fast, or a mono-diet fast. Revealing how fasting can help or heal many chronic conditions, such as type II diabetes, childhood seizures, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, psoriasis, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, Buhner shows fasting as a way to truly inhabit the body, to experience its sacredness, and to activate its deep capabilities for self-healing. <br> <br>STEPHEN HARROD BUHNER lectures throughout the United States on herbal medicine, the sacredness of plants, and the intelligence of nature.

The text introduces the major plant families of the world, arranged in alphabetical order. The principal characteristics of each family are given and then a selection of genera and species is described and illustrated. Within this book the author, Frances Perry, tells the botanical, horticultural and historical story of thousands of flowers. Not only has she succeeded in giving precise botanical information about the plants she includes, but lively historical anecdotes, enthralling accounts of how many familiar plants were first discovered and popularized, and stories about the origins of their names make this an immensely readable book. There are also fascinating details of how the different plants were used in their native lands in the past and how they are presently used. There are many practical hints for growing and caring for plants as well as invaluable information about how they can be most effective in gardens. The paintings, botanically accurate to the smallest detail, make this book so beautiful that anyone will enjoy just browsing through it. Some of the plants portrayed have been selected for their sheer loveliness; others because they are particularly interesting or unusual; and many more because they are so well known and loved. The author and artist have collaborated closely throughout this massive project, with the result that text and pictures are completely complementary. Every illustrated plant is thoroughly described in text.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Death of a Poison Pen (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 20)</h2><p>As a series of poison pen letters sweeps through the town of Lochdubh, Hamish Macbeth begins to suspect a sinister motive, a suspicion that is justified when the local postmistress is found hanged, a supposed suicide, but Hamish&#39;s investigation is complicated by the arrival of the distracting Jenny Ogilvie. 30,000 first printing.</p><p><b>M.

The art of monotype has experienced a surge of popularity in recent years, and artists working in other mediums will enjoy exploring the creative potential this process offers them. A brief history of monotype is followed by a comprehensive chapter on materials. The step-by-step instructions are accompanied by some of the finest examples of monotype being done today.</p><p><b>Julia Ayres</b> is an award-winning wildlife artist and frequent contributor to <i>American Artist</i> magazine. She and her husband David live in Chouteau, Oklahoma.The first printmakers were cave people who painted their hands and slapped them against cave walls. Today, printmakers like Ayres still use methods nearly as simple. Others, like printmaker and painter Welden, have created completely new processes, like his solarplate method. Monotypes, the subject of Ayres's book, are created by applying oil- or water-based paint to a flat plate. By pressing a dampened sheet of paper to the plate, a single print is made. The earliest such prints go back to Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, around 1640. Later, Degas and Gauguin experimented with the method. Today, there is a virtual explosion of new ways to create monotypes. Ayres explores the work of a variety of such artists, who demonstrate imaging techniques, masks, stencils, collage, and mixed-media prints. The results vary from traditional images to eccentric, colorful fantasies. In 1972, Welden discovered that polymer printers' plates could be used in printmaking by exposing them to the sun. Draw on a transparency, place it over the plate, expose it to the sun, and the plate is, in effect, etched for printing. The method is now widely used, and Welden and Muir have produced the first book on this extremely versatile art. Both books are highly recommended. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Return to Earth</h2><p>A book written by Buzz.

A major hit in Germany that went on to become one of Europe&#x2019;s biggest literary blockbusters in the last five years, Night Train to Lisbon is an astonishing novel, a compelling exploration of consciousness, the possibility of truly understanding another person, and the ability of language to define our very selves. Raimund Gregorius is a Latin teacher at a Swiss college who one day after a chance encounter with a mysterious Portuguese woman abandons his old life to start a new one. He takes the night train to Lisbon and carries with him a book by Amadeu de Prado, a (fictional) Portuguese doctor and essayist whose writings explore the ideas of loneliness, mortality, death, friendship, love, and loyalty. Gregorius becomes obsessed by what he reads and restlessly struggles to comprehend the life of the author. His investigations lead him all over the city of Lisbon, as he speaks to those who were entangled in Prado&#x2019;s life. Gradually, the picture of an extraordinary man emerges a doctor and poet who rebelled against Salazar&#x2019;s dictatorship.</p><p>A professor of philosophy, Pascal Mercier was born in 1944 in Bern, Switzerland, and currently lives in Berlin.<p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley</p><p>According to its American publisher, Night Train to Lisbon has rung up "over two million copies sold worldwide" and has been lavishly reviewed throughout Europe. Pascal Mercier is a professor of philosophy who writes under a pen name -- his real name is Peter Bieri -- and, obviously, a person of intelligence and erudition, qualities that are evident throughout this novel. But though it is being launched in this country with more energy and enthusiasm than are generally mustered for works of fiction in translation, my hunch is that this will be yet another European bestseller met with indifference on this side of the Atlantic. </p><p>It's a strange book. Its protagonist, Raimund Gregorius, is 57 years old, a professor of dead languages at a secondary school -- a "gymnasium" -- in Switzerland. He is set in his ways and most unlikely to change them: </p><p>"Mundus, the most reliable and predictable person in this building and probably in the whole history of the school, working here for more than thirty years, impeccable in his profession, a pillar of the institution, a little boring perhaps, but respected and even feared in the university for his astounding knowledge of ancient languages, mocked lovingly by his students who put him to the test every year by calling him in the middle of the night and asking him about the conjecture for a remote passage in an ancient text, only to get every time off the top of his head information that was both dry and exhaustive, including a critical commentary with other possible meanings, all of it presented perfectly and calmly without a soup�on of anger at the disturbance -- Mundus, a man with an impossibly old-fashioned, even archaic first name you simply had to abbreviate, and couldn't abbreviate any other way, an abbreviation that revealed the character of the man as no other word could have, for what he carried around in him as a philologist was in fact no less than a whole world, or rather several whole worlds, since along with those Latin and Greek passages, his head also held the Hebrew that had amazed several Old Testament scholars." </p><p>He is comfortable with words, with texts, far less comfortable with people. His childless marriage ended several years ago. Now he lives alone in a drab apartment, talks from time to time with his friend Constantine Doxiades, wears heavy eyeglasses and assumes that the rest of his days will be spent in exactly the same way. Then, on his way to the school on a rainy morning, he is stopped in the street by a woman who writes a telephone number on his forehead with a felt-tipped pen. He is startled but recovers, and in their brief encounter before she disappears he learns that her native language is Portuguese. He feels his life changing. He goes to a Spanish bookstore, where he is drawn to a book called A Goldsmith of Words, by Amadeu de Prado. The dealer, who "found it last year in the junk box of a secondhand bookshop in Lisbon," presents it to him as a gift. The book is in Portuguese, which he does not know, but he obtains a dictionary and laboriously sets about reading it, learning a new language in the process. </p><p>As he immerses himself in the book, Gregorius recalls the words of Marcus Aurelius: "Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul; but later thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of respecting and honoring thyself. For every man has but one life. But yours is nearly finished, though in it you had no regard for yourself but placed thy felicity in the souls of others. . . . But those who do not observe the impulses of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy." He realizes that the chance encounter with the woman and the gift of the book are omens that cannot be ignored. He tells himself that "I'd like to make something different out of my life," that "my time is running out and there may not be much more of it left." </p><p>So he quits the school, closes up his apartment, and takes a night train to Lisbon to search for Amadeu de Prado. It isn't an easy journey, since he has spasms of doubt about this "crackpot idea" and more than once thinks to turn back, but he persists. Continuing to work his way through Prado's book, he learns that the author was a doctor, a "poet and a language mystic who had taken up arms and fought against Salazar," the dictator who had kept Portugal under his thumb for four decades beginning in the 1930s. He comes to realize that "I'd like to know what it was like to be him," or at least "what it is like when you imagined being the other person." He wonders: "Was it possible that the best way to make sure of yourself was to know and understand someone else? One whose life had been completely different and had had a completely different logic than your own? How did curiosity for another life go together with the awareness that your own time was running out?"</p><p>Prado is dead, of an aneurysm, and so is his wife, but there are others who have survived. The first important one whom Gregorius meets is Prado's fierce sister Adriana, who, since her brother's death, "had lived alone in this house for thirty-one years, thirty-one years alone with the memories and the emptiness left behind by the brother." When her brother was alive, she had been "a dragon, a dragon who protected Amadeu," and now she is the guardian of his memory, preserving his bedroom and office exactly as they were when he occupied them. </p><p>There is Jo�o E�a, "a tortured victim of the Salazar regime" who knew Prado in the resistance and treasured him as "the godless priest," a man devoid of conventional religious belief yet who "thought things through to the end. He always thought them through to the end, no matter how black the consequences were." There is Maria Jo�o, "the great, untouched love" of Prado's life, who is now past 80 but still possesses "such inconspicuous and yet such perfect confidence and independence." There is Prado's younger sister, M�lodie, "a word invented for her, for her presence was as beautiful and fleeting as a melody, everybody fell in love with her, nobody could hold on to her." There is Estef�nia Espinhosa, brilliant and beautiful, who had been Prado's "chance to finally leave the courthouse, go out to the free, hot square of life, and live for this one time completely according to his wish, to his passion, and to hell with others," but whom Prado could not bring himself to love because she was involved, however half-heartedly, with his best friend. </p><p>Et cetera. Slowly, Amadeu de Prado's portrait takes shape. As Jo�o E�a puts it, he was "a walking paradox: self-confident and of fearless demeanor, but also one who constantly felt the look of others on him and suffered from it. . . . Amadeu, he was the most loyal person in the universe, loyalty was his religion." In sum, a difficult and complicated man, but an admirable one who shared Gregorius's attachment to words but was also a man of action. </p><p>All of which is interesting enough, but in a rather clinical way. One problem with Night Train to Lisbon is that its plot, if plot is the word for it, consists almost entirely of talk -- talk, talk, talk -- about people and events in the past. The effect of this endless conversation is numbing rather than stimulating. The subject of seeking a new life is rich, as innumerable American novels have made plain, but it's never really clear here whether the central story belongs to Gregorius or to Prado, and there's scarcely a hint of dramatic tension as Gregorius stumbles his way toward what he learns about Prado. Possibly, Mercier's American publisher thinks that his fiction offers the kind of intellectual puzzles and trickery that many readers love in the work of Umberto Eco, but there are no such pleasures to be found here. Night Train to Lisbon never engages the reader, in particular never makes the reader care about Gregorius. It's an intelligent book, all right, but there's barely a breath of life in it. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

The detective&#x2019;s body is healing; it&#x2019;s his morphine-addled mind that conjures spectral visions of Tee Jolie Melton, a young woman who in reality has gone missing. An iPod with an old blues song left by his bedside turns Robicheaux into a man obsessed...And as oil companies assign blame after an epic disaster threatens the Gulf&#x2019;s very existence, Robicheaux unearths connections between tragedies both global and personal&#x2014;and faces down forces that can corrupt and destroy the best of men.</p><p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction. He&#x2019;s authored thirty-seven&nbsp;novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.<br> <br>FOR THE REST of the world, the season was still fall, marked by cool nights and the gold-green remnants of summer. For me, down in South Louisiana, in the Garden District of New Orleans, the wetlands that lay far beyond my hospital window had turned to winter, one characterized by stricken woods that were drained of water and strung with a web of gray leaves and dead air vines that had wrapped themselves as tightly as cord around the trees.<br> <br>Those who have had the following experience will not find my descriptions exaggerated or even metaphorical in nature. A morphine dream has neither walls nor a ceiling nor a floor. The sleep it provides is like a warm bath, free of concerns about mortality and pain and memories from the past. Morpheus also allows us vision through a third eye that we never knew existed. His acolytes can see through time and become participants in grand events they had believed accessible only through history books and films. On one occasion, I saw a hot-air balloon rising from its tether in Audubon Park, a uniformed soldier operating a telegrapher&#x2019;s key inside the wicker basket, while down below other members of the Confederate Signal Corps shared sandwiches and drank coffee from tin cups, all of them as stately and stiff as figures in a sepia-tinted photograph.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t wish to be too romantic about my experience in the recovery facility there on St. Charles Avenue in uptown New Orleans. While I gazed through my window at the wonderful green streetcar wobbling down the tracks on the neutral ground, the river fog puffing out of the live oak trees, the pink and purple neon on the Katz &amp; Besthoff drugstore as effervescent as tentacles of smoke twirling from marker grenades, I knew with a sinking heart that what I was seeing was an illusion, that in reality the Katz &amp; Besthoff drugstore and the umbrella-covered sno&#x2019;ball carts along St. Charles and the musical gaiety of the city had slipped into history long ago, and somewhere out on the edge of my vision, the onset of permanent winter waited for me.<br> <br>Though I&#x2019;m a believer, that did not lessen the sense of trepidation I experienced in these moments. I felt as if the sun were burning a hole in the sky, causing it to blacken and collapse like a giant sheet of carbon paper suddenly crinkling and folding in on itself, and I had no power to reverse the process. I felt that a great darkness was spreading across the land, not unlike ink spilling across the face of a topographic map.<br> <br>Many years ago, when I was recovering from wounds I received in a Southeast Asian country, a United States Army psychiatrist told me that my morphine-induced dreams were creating what he called a &#x201c;world destruction fantasy,&#x201d; one that had its origins in childhood and the dissolution of one&#x2019;s natal family. He was a scientist and a learned man, and I did not argue with him. Even at night, when I lay in a berth on a hospital ship, far from free-fire zones and the sound of ammunition belts popping under a burning hooch, I did not argue. Nor did I contend with the knowledge of the psychiatrist when dead members of my platoon spoke to me in the rain and a mermaid with an Asian face beckoned to me from a coral cave strung with pink fans, her hips spangled with yellow coins, her mouth parting, her naked breasts as flushed with color as the inside of a conch shell.<br> <br>The cult of Morpheus is a strange community indeed, and it requires that one take up residence in a country where the improbable becomes commonplace. No matter what I did, nor how many times I disappeared out my window into the mists along St. Charles Avenue, back into an era of rooftop jazz bands and historical streetcars filled with men in bowler hats and women who carried parasols, the watery gray rim of a blighted planet was always out there&#x2014;intransigent and corrupt, a place where moth and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal.<br> <br>IN THE EARLY A.M. on a Friday, I asked the black attendant to open the windows in my room. It was against the rules, but the attendant was an elderly and kind man who had spent five days on a rooftop after the collapse of the levees during Hurricane Katrina, and he wasn&#x2019;t given to concerns about authority. The windows reached to the ceiling and were hung with ventilated green shutters that were closed during the heat of the day to filter the sun&#x2019;s glare. The attendant opened both the glass and the shutters and let in the night smell of the roses and camellias and magnolia and rain mist blowing through the trees. The air smelled like Bayou Teche when it&#x2019;s spring and the fish are spawning among the water hyacinths and the frogs are throbbing in the cattails and the flooded cypress. It smelled like the earth may have smelled during the first days of creation, before any five-toed footprints appeared along the banks of a river.<br> <br>Or at least I think the black man opened the windows. Even to this day I cannot be sure of what I said and saw and heard that night. Like the drunkard who fears both his memory and his dreams, I had become cynical about my perceptions, less out of fear that they were illusions than a conviction that they were real.<br> <br>After the black man had left the room, I turned my head on the pillow and looked into the face of a Cajun girl by the name of Tee Jolie Melton.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mr. Dave,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I read all about the shooting in the papers. You was on television, too. I didn&#x2019;t know you was here in New Orleans. I&#x2019;m sorry to see you hurt like this. You was talking French in your sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you, Tee Jolie. How&#x2019;d you get in?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;T&#x2019;rew the front door. You want me to come back another time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you get me a glass of water?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got you better than that. I brought you a Dr Pepper and a lime I cut up, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s what you always drank when you came into the club. I brought you somet&#x2019;ing else, too. It&#x2019;s an iPod I filled wit&#x2019; music. I loaded &#x2018;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&#x2019; on it, &#x2019;cause I knew how you always liked that song.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes were blue-green, her hair long and mahogany-colored with twists of gold in it that were as bright as buttercups. She was part Indian and part Cajun and part black and belonged to that ethnic group we call Creoles, although the term is a misnomer.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember when you he&#x2019;ped me with my car crash? You was so kind. You took care of everyt&#x2019;ing, and I didn&#x2019;t have no trouble at all because of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t <i>a</i> car crash. As I recalled, <i>it</i> was at least three car crashes, but I didn&#x2019;t pursue the point. The most interesting aspect of Tee Jolie&#x2019;s auto accidents were her written explanations at the scene. To the best of my memory, these were her words:<br> <br>&#x201c;I was backing up when this light pole came out of nowhere and smashed into my bumper.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was turning left, but somebody was blocking the lane, so, trying to be polite, I switched my turn indicator and cut through the school parking lot, but I didn&#x2019;t have no way of knowing the chain was up on the drive at that time of day, because it never is.<br> <br>&#x201c;When the transmission went into reverse, Mr. Fontenot was putting my groceries in the backseat, and the door handle caught his coat sleeve and drug him across the street into the gas pump that blew up. I tried to give him first aid on the mouth, but he had already swallowed this big wad of gum that the fireman had to pull out with his fingers. I think Mr. Fontenot almost bit off one of the fireman&#x2019;s fingers and didn&#x2019;t have the courtesy to say he was sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tee Jolie fixed a glass of ice and Dr Pepper with a lime slice and stuck a straw in it and held it up to my mouth. She was wearing a long-sleeve shirt printed with purple and green flowers. Her skirt was pale blue and fluffy and pleated, and her shoes looked tiny on her feet. You could say that Tee Jolie was made for the camera, her natural loveliness of a kind that begged to be worshipped on a stage or hung on a wall. Her face was thin, her eyes elongated, and her hair full of waves, as though it had been recently unbraided, although that was the way it always looked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel selfish coming here, &#x2019;cause it wasn&#x2019;t just to give you a Dr Pepper and the iPod,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I came here to ax you somet&#x2019;ing, but I ain&#x2019;t gonna do it now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can say anything you want, Tee Jolie, because I&#x2019;m not even sure you&#x2019;re here. I dream in both the day and the night about people who have been dead many years. In my dreams, they&#x2019;re alive, right outside the window, Confederate soldiers and the like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They had to come a long way, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s safe to say,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;My wife and daughter were here earlier, and I know they were real. I&#x2019;m not sure about you. No offense meant. That&#x2019;s just the way it is these days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know something I ain&#x2019;t suppose to know, and it makes me scared, Mr. Dave,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>She was sitting in the chair, her ankles close together, her hands folded on her knees. I had always thought of her as a tall girl, particularly when she was onstage at the zydeco club where she sang, an arterial-red electric guitar hanging from her neck. Now she looked smaller than she had a few moments ago. She lifted her face up into mine. There was a mole by the corner of her mouth. I didn&#x2019;t know what she wanted me to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you get involved with some bad guys?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t call them that. How come you to ax me that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re a good person, and sometimes you trust people you shouldn&#x2019;t. Good women tend to do that. That&#x2019;s why a lot of us men don&#x2019;t deserve them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father was killed in a oil-well blowout, wasn&#x2019;t he? Out on the Gulf when you was in Vietnam. That&#x2019;s right, ain&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, he was a derrick man.&#x201d;<br> <br>As with many Creoles and Cajuns, there was a peculiarity at work in Tee Jolie&#x2019;s speech. She was ungrammatical and her vocabulary was limited, but because of the cadence in her language and her regional accent, she was always pleasant to listen to, a voice from a gentler and more reserved time, even when what she spoke of was not pleasant to think about, in this case the death of my father, Big Aldous.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m wit&#x2019; a man. He&#x2019;s separated but not divorced. A lot of people know his name. Famous people come to the place where we live. I heard them talking about centralizers. You know what they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re used inside the casing on drilling wells.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bunch of men was killed &#x2019;cause maybe not enough of those centralizers was there or somet&#x2019;ing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read about that, Tee Jolie. It&#x2019;s public knowledge. You shouldn&#x2019;t worry because you know about this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The man I&#x2019;m wit&#x2019; does bidness sometimes with dangerous people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you should get away from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be married. I&#x2019;m gonna have his baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fixed my gaze on the glass of Dr Pepper and ice that sat on the nightstand.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want some more?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but I can hold it by myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except I see the pain in your face when you move,&#x201d; she said. She lifted the glass and straw to my mouth. &#x201c;They hurt you real bad, huh, Mr. Dave?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They shot me up proper,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;They shot your friend Mr. Clete, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They smacked both of us around. But we left every one of them on the ground. They&#x2019;re going to be dead for a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Outside the window, I could hear the rain and wind sweeping through the trees, scattering leaves from the oaks and needles from the slash pines across the roof.<br> <br>&#x201c;I always had my music and the piece of land my father left me and my sister and my mama,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I sang wit&#x2019; BonSoir, Catin. I was queen of the Crawfish Festival in Breaux Bridge. I t&#x2019;ink back on that, and it&#x2019;s like it was ten years ago instead of two. A lot can change in a short time, cain&#x2019;t it? My mama died. Now it&#x2019;s just me and my li&#x2019;l sister, Blue, and my granddaddy back in St. Martinville.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a great musician, and you have a wonderful voice. You&#x2019;re a beautiful person, Tee Jolie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you talk like that, it don&#x2019;t make me feel good, no. It makes me sad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He says I can have an abortion if I want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s his offer to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t got his divorce yet.

His blond hair was cut like a little boy&#x2019;s. His eyes were bright green, more energetic than they should have been, one step below wired. He set his bag on the floor and began pulling magazines and two city library books and a box of pralines and a carton of orange juice and a <i>Times-Picayune</i> from it. When he bent over, his coat swung open, exposing a nylon shoulder holster and the blue-black .38 with white handles that it carried. He removed a pint bottle of vodka from the bag and unscrewed the cap and poured at least three inches into the carton of orange juice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Early in the day,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He tossed his unlit cigarette end over end into the wastebasket and drank out of the carton, staring out the window at the robins fluttering in the oak trees and the Spanish moss stirring in the breeze. &#x201c;Tell me if you want me to leave, big mon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know better than that,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw Alafair and Molly getting in their car.

I think it&#x2019;s moving around.&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyes were bright with a manic energy that I didn&#x2019;t think was related to the alcohol. He kept swallowing and clearing his throat, as though a piece of rust were caught in it. &#x201c;The speckled trout are running. We need to get out on the salt. The White House is saying the oil has gone away.&#x201d;<br> <br>He waited for me to speak. But I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe it?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;The oil company says the same thing.

This easy-to-use book cuts through the confusion. In this informative, 128-page book, author Jan Hart covers pigment properties while providing helpful information on combining colors on the palette for optimal effect. The full-color book features an array of step-by-step painting demonstrations and a must-have glossary of pigment equivalencies for the most popular paint manufacturers.</p></p><p>Colour when using watercolours can be a tricky thing. We&#39;ve all done it, you think the colour is just right, then as the paint dries, you find your colour has faded. Worse still, if not careful- your watercolours can turn to mud if you mix too many colours or try too many overlays. There tend to be two lines of thought - mix your colour in your palette or on your painting. This book looks at colour groups, mixing, pigments, properties and ways to paint with chosen palettes. I thought it was a very fresh approach, full of techniques, examples, ideas to try out and inspiration. You&#39;ll learn a lot about colour along the way.

It's as though a person has a little psychic box that he feels compelled to keep filled with worries. When one worry disappears from the box, he immediately replaces it with another worry, so the box is always full. He is never short of worries. If a new crop of worries comes in, the person sorts through the box for lesser worries and kicks them out, until he has enough room for the new worries. The lesser worries just lie around on the floor, until there's room in the box for them again, and then they're put back in. They're welcomed by the worries that have been in the box all the time: "Hi, guys! Good to have you back. Boy, you should have seen the duds that just left. And they had the nerve to call themselves worries!"For a while I worried that my worry theory wasflawed. I was talking to an old gentleman who gives every indication that his worry box is empty. Ed's ninety-three."Do you realize," I said to Ed the other day, hoping to worry him and thereby gain support for my theory, "that this new federal budget deficit will add another third-of-a-trillion dollars to the national debt? If this keeps on, by the year two thousand, we'll be about five zillion dollars in debt. How are we ever going to pay off a debt like that?"Ed chuckled and tapped the ash off his cigar. "Beats me," he said. "But it ain't my worry.""Yeah, sure," I said, "because you're an old geezer. But what about your great-grandchildren? They'll have to pay.""Don't have any great-grandchildren. Got one that's fair to middlin', but the rest ain't worth a dang. Serve the loafers right if they have to pay off the zillion-dollar debt. Put some grit into 'em.""Well then, how about the banks and the S and Ls? They're dropping like flies. That has to worry you.""Nope. Don't have no money.""Here's a good one. Pollution is eating holes in the ozone layer and within twenty-five years ... Okay, forget that worry. Let's see. Hmmmm. There's a lot of new sexually transmitted diseases, of course, but I suppose you're in a low-risk group.""Ain't none lower.""Yeah, but suppose you went to a dentist who had a deadly disease and ...""No teeth.""Right. You don't have to worry about your hair catching on fire, either. You could get burglarized, though. How about that?""Got nothing to burgle."I tried for another hour to worry Ed, but without success. He seemed pretty well to have knocked my worry theory in the head."I've got to leave now," I said irritably. "Just remember, I'm picking you up at five o'clock tomorrow morning to go fishing.""Good," he said. "Who's driving the boat, Smoky Joe?""Joe can't make it. I'm driving the boat.""Now <i>that</i> worries me!"I was elated. My theory was still intact. Ed had only one teeny-weeny worry, but one big enough to fill his worry box. He just had a teeny-weeny box.I, on the other hand, have a very large worry box. My wife, Bun, is one of my major suppliers of worries."What did you do with the checkbook?" she asks me.<i>THE CHECKBOOK!</i> Is that monster loose again? I imagine at that very moment an escaped convict is picking it up off the sidewalk. Maybe he will forge my name and deplete our checking account of every last penny and after he has exhausted all our funds buying dope, he will come to our house, because the address is on the checks, and he and I will grapple with each other, and he will pull a knife and ... !"Oh," Bun will say, "here's the checkbook in my purse. Silly me! Now what's wrong with you?""Nothing," I say, booting that worry out of my worry box, at least until the next time Bun asks, "What did you do with the checkbook?"Bun's telephone technique is designed specifically to worry me. The phone rings. Bun picks it up. "Hello ... . Yes ... . Nooo! <i>[Me: One of the kids has done something bad with his car.]</i> Oh my gosh! How bad? <i>[Me: It's real bad. Otherwise, the police wouldn't be calling.]</i> You just never expect these things to happen to you. <i>[Me: I do.]</i> When can we see him?" <i>[Me: Only during visiting hours, when he'll be wearing either a full-body cast or an orange jumpsuit.]</i>"So what is it now?" I ask, steeling myself to deal with the horrible emergency."Ernie's Garage. Ernie said he fixed the car's oil leak with a thirty-five-cent part. What's funny is that to install it, he had to totally disassemble the car. Isn't that amazing, just a thirty-five-cent part? How lucky can you get! By the way, Ernie says he wants to talk to you about something when you get a chance."Ernie the Mechanic wants to talk to me? I know what he wants. He wants my house in exchange for totally disassembling my car, that's what he wants. We're about to join the ranks of the homeless!You see from this example that the old worry about the kid is immediately replaced by a new worry about becoming homeless. I used to pity the homeless; now I am one. And so on. The worry box is always kept exactly full.Where Bun really excels in worry production for me is on camping trips. It is popularly thought thatcamping provides a wonderful way to escape from the stresses of modern city life. I myself think this. I can always tell it's time to head for the mountains when I start getting stress cramps in my eyelids. They are quite painful, and cause me to go about for days with a startled, somewhat horrified expression. People coming toward me on the sidewalk look at me and then jerk their heads around to see what's sneaking up behind them. It's an embarrassment, not to mention a major social liability.Once I'm back in the mountains, though, and Bun and I set up our tent and roll out our sleeping bags, the stress cramps vanish from my eyelids. Soon, I'm drifting into a deep and peaceful slumber, the fragrances of leaf mold and cedar boughs caressing my nostrils. It's nice."Was that you?" Bun asks."Nope. Probably just leaf mold.""I mean that snuffling. Did you just snuffle?""I don't think so," I reply, trying to recall the characteristics of a snuffle."Oh well, go to sleep. It was probably just my imagination."Yeah, but maybe not, I think. Maybe something outside the tent snuffled. A bird wouldn't snuffle. Squirrels and chipmunks are too small to snuffle. Something would have to be pretty big to snuffle. A deer could make a sound similar to a snuffle but not a true snuffle. Actually, the only animal I've ever heard do a true snuffle is a ... <i>BEAR!</i>"For heaven's sake, what's wrong now?" Bun asks."Eyelid cramps."Now, here's an interesting aspect of my worry theory. Up to the point where Bun mentions the snuffle, my worry box is neatly layered with worries about the children, work, money, illness, poverty, pestilence, environment, war, the checkbook, famine, etc., each patiently awaiting its turn for my attention. But the instant the snuffle is mentioned, and its source identified as <i>BEAR</i>, all those other worries are blasted right out of the box by the sudden inflation of the snuffle worry. War, poverty, pestilence--why, they couldn't even be shoehorned back into my worry box, it's packed so tight with snuffle.As with most of my worries, the snuffle turned out to be nothing of consequence. The problem with a major worry, though, is sometimes it can produce the very condition that you are worried about.When I was a kid, I would lie awake all night before the opening day of trout season worrying that I wouldn't wake up at four o'clock so I could be the first one at the best hole on the crick. I kept checking the alarm clock, to make sure it was still ticking. It had awakened me every day for school but it would be just like the treacherous machine to conk out the night before trout season. Every half hour, I checked the tomato can next to my bed, to make sure my worms weren't suffocating. I got up several times to arrange my rod and tackle for a quick getaway. I checked my fishing clothes and boots, to make sure they were all in order, a fairly easy task, because I was wearing them. The night seemed endless. Finally, the clock ticked its wayto 3:30. Great! I was going to make it! I closed my eyes in relief. The next time I opened them it was a quarter past ten! <i>ARRRRHHHHH!</i>"The stupid alarm didn't go off!" I screamed at my mother."Yes, it did. But you were so exhausted you slept right through it. I thought if you were that tired, you needed the sleep.""Sleep? Sleep! I needed to go fishing! Maybe there won't be any fish left in the crick by the time I get there. I've missed the best fishing time of the whole season. Maybe ...""Why are you looking like that?" Mom asked, glancing over her shoulder."Eyelid cramps."I was contemplating modification of my worry theory the morning I pulled up in front of Ed's cabin to take him fishing. My conversation with the old geezer had convinced me that as a person grows older, his worry box grows smaller. The box is still always full but it doesn't require so many worries to fill it. By age ninety-three, there's room for only one or two little dried-up worries in the box.I honked my horn. After ten minutes or so, Ed opened the door of his cabin and headed down the walk. I ate a sandwich, drank a cup of coffee, read the sports page of the paper, and was thinking of taking a nap by the time he got to the car. He seemed in his usual good spirits."Why are you always so cheerful?" I growled. "Must be because you have so few worries.""Nope," he said. "It's because every morning this incredibly wonderful thing happens to me.""I'm not sure I want to hear this," I said, "but w...</p><h2>The Rise of Athens: The Story of the World&#39;s Greatest Civilization</h2><p><b>A magisterial account of how a tiny city-state in ancient Greece became history&#x2019;s most influential civilization, from the bestselling author of acclaimed biographies of Cicero, Augustus, and Hadrian</b><br>&nbsp;<br> Filled with tales of adventure and astounding reversals of fortune, <i>The Rise of Athens</i> celebrates the city-state that transformed the world&#x2014;from the democratic revolution that marked its beginning, through the city&#x2019;s political and cultural golden age, to its decline into the ancient equivalent of a modern-day university town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anthony Everitt constructs his history with unforgettable portraits of the talented, tricky, ambitious, and unscrupulous Athenians who fueled the city&#x2019;s rise: Themistocles, the brilliant naval strategist who led the Greeks to a decisive victory over their Persian enemies; Pericles, arguably the greatest Athenian statesman of them all; and the wily Alcibiades, who changed his political allegiance several times during the course of the Peloponnesian War&#x2014;and died in a hail of assassins&#x2019; arrows.

Rocky, bare mountains are interspersed with numerous, small, fertile plains. But much of the soil is dry and stony, and more suitable for olive trees than fields of wheat. Travel by land between the meager centers of habitation was laborious.<br><br>Athens was the chief city of Attica, a triangular tract of level ground about nine hundred square miles in extent. This plain is punctuated by hills and surrounded by mountains on two sides and on a third by the sea. Mount Hymettus was famous for its honey, and still is, and Pentelicon for its honey-�colored marble, from which it built its temples to the gods. Rich lead and silver deposits at Laurium in the southeast were found and mined. Summers are hot and dry and heavy outbursts of rain mark the fall.<br><br>The poverty of the land of Greece brought with it three consequences. It bred a fierce individualism, a cantankerous refusal to agree with those living on the other side of mountains; states were many and tiny and Athens was one of the largest. Unable to feed their growing numbers, the Athenians became seafarers, although sailing was dangerous in the windy winters. Around the eighth century they joined other Greek statelets in exporting surplus citizens to new settlements around the Mediterranean littoral and importing grain from the Black Sea and elsewhere in growing quantities.<br><br>The citadel of Athens was the Acropolis, or &#x201c;high city,&#x201d; an almost impregnable outcrop that rises one hundred and fifty meters above sea level. There is evidence of human occupation as early as 5,000 b.c., but we hear little of the place during the age of the Mycenaean monarchs.<br><br>The Athenians held that they belonged to an ethnic group called the Ionians, who had always lived in Greece (the word derives from Ion, a semi-�legendary king of Athens). Not long after the traditional date of the fall of Troy towards the end of the second millennium, another group called the Dorians, Greek speakers but with their own cultural customs and dialect, came down from the north and settled in Greece. Under pressure from these newcomers, some Ionians emigrated to Asia Minor where they settled and prospered. Athens argued that she was &#x201c;the eldest land of Ionia&#x201d; and felt some ongoing responsibility for her cousins overseas.<br><br>How many of these beliefs are true cannot now be told and we have no choice but to open our narrative with instructive fiction rather than irretrievable fact.<br><br>The future of Athens was determined by a goddess, Pallas Athena, and by a king called Theseus, whose legendary character traits express, for good or ill, Athenian identity.<br><br>It was as well not to cross Athena&#x2019;s path. From the moment of her birth she emanated power. Her father, Zeus, had sex with Metis, the divine personification of Wisdom, but then had second thoughts. Fearing that their child would grow up to be more intelligent than he was himself, he opened his mouth wide and swallowed Metis up. Nine months later he experienced a raging&#x2014;�literally, it would turn out, a splitting&#x2014;�migraine. He ordered his son Hephaestus, god of metalwork, to strike his head with an ax, hoping that this would relieve the pain. The divine blacksmith obeyed and out jumped Athena from the crack in his skull, adult and fully armed.<br><br>She was a perpetual virgin and tomboy. As goddess of war, she could vanquish in combat her half brother Ares (the Roman Mars), lord of battles who delighted in the slaughter of men and the sack of towns. However, Athena took no pleasure in fighting and preferred to settle disputes by discussion and mediation. She patronized crafts and the making of clothes.<br><br>She is unique among the Olympians in having a city named after her. She regarded Athens as hers following a quarrel with the sea god and brother of Zeus, Poseidon. As a mark of possession, he thrust his trident into the Acropolis and a spring of seawater sprang out from the rock (it still flows today). Later, Athena laid her own claim in a more peaceful manner, by planting the first olive tree alongside the spring. A furious Poseidon challenged her to a duel, but Zeus insisted on peaceful arbitration. A court of Olympian gods awarded the prize to Athena. Poseidon resentfully sent a tsunami to flood Attica, so she took up residence in the city and kept it under watchful guard.<br><br>From early times the Athenians welcomed the goddess with open arms. She was foster mother to one of the first kings, the semi-�divine Erechtheus. From his vantage point in the eighth century, Homer celebrated<br><br>the Athenians from their splendid citadel in the realm of the magnanimous Erechtheus, a child of the fruitful Earth who was brought up by Athena Daughter of Zeus and established by her in her own rich shrine, where bulls and rams are offered to him yearly in due season by Athenian youths.<br><br>The Athenians learned from their tutelary goddess that military force was an invaluable arm of policy, but that it should be tempered by metis, wisdom or, in its less complete sense, ingenuity and craftiness.<br>Aegeus, legendary king of Athens during the Mycenaean age, was childless, but on his travels he enjoyed a one-�night stand with an attractive princess. He suspected, or perhaps just hoped, that he had made her pregnant, so he hid a sword and a pair of sandals under a rock. Before leaving, he told the woman that if she gave birth to a son she should show him where they were when he grew up, and tell him to take them with him to Athens.<br><br>A baby duly arrived, whom she named Theseus. When a young adult he learned about the tokens from his mother, who gave him Aegeus&#x2019;s message. He did as he was told and lifted up the rock with ease. He refused to take ship to Athens, although it was the safest method of travel. Instead, looking for adventure, he set off by land to Athens. En route he sought out and destroyed a number of dangerous opponents. The first of them wielded a large club, which Theseus carried about with him ever afterwards, rather as Heracles, whom he greatly admired, invariably wore the skin of a lion he had killed. Next came Sinis the Pine-�bender, who tied travelers to two pines he had bent down to the ground; he then let them go, tearing the victims apart.<br><br>Feeling randy, Theseus chased after Sinis&#x2019;s pretty little daughter, who had very sensibly run away. Plutarch reports that he<br><br>looked for her high and low, but she had disappeared into a place which was overgrown with shrubs and rushes and wild asparagus. The girl in her childish innocence was imploring the plants to hide her; and promising that if they saved her, she would never trample them down or burn them. Theseus called her and gave her his word that he would not harm her but treat her with respect&#x2014;�and she came out.<br><br>Once he had caught her, he took her to his bed. After she had borne him a son, he married her off to some nonentity. Throughout his life Theseus was a sexual predator.<br><br>After this diversion he resumed his Heraclean labors. Next on his list was the terrifying Crommyonian sow; some said she was not a pig but a depraved murderess who was &#x201c;nicknamed the Sow because of her life and habits.&#x201d; Either way, Theseus killed her. He then dispatched the robber Sciron. His modus operandi had been to stick out his feet to passersby on a narrow cliff path and to insist they wash them. While they were doing so he tipped them into the sea. Of other challengers the most alarming was Procrustes, who forced travelers to fit onto his iron bed; if they were too tall he cut off their legs and if too short stretched them as on a rack until they were the right size.<br><br>At long last Theseus made it to Athens. He was unknown to anyone there. His tunic was unusually long and touched his feet. His hair was plaited and, according to an ancient commentator, &#x201c;nice-�looking.&#x201d; He passed a temple construction site and the builders jeered at him. What, they bantered, was a marriageable girl doing wandering about on her own? Theseus said nothing, but took the oxen from the men&#x2019;s cart and flung them over the temple&#x2019;s half-�built roof. He was not a man to suffer fools gladly.<br><br>Strangers in ancient Greece were routinely given a hospitable welcome and the king offered Theseus a meal in his palace on the Acropolis. His wife, the celebrated witch Medea&#x2014;�back from the Black Sea with the Argonauts&#x2014;knew who Theseus was. Fearful that her position would be threatened by the arrival of a son, she persuaded the aged and infirm Aegeus to have this potentially troublesome foreign guest poisoned at dinner.<br><br>For his part the young man thought it best to reveal his identity to his father tactfully; when the meat was served he drew his sword as if to cut off a piece, hoping that the king would recognize it. Aegeus saw the weapon and immediately acknowledged his son&#x2019;s identity. We may assume that the food was removed. After beating off some competitors for the succession to the throne, Theseus became heir apparent. Medea left town.<br>Not long afterwards collectors of human tribute arrived from Crete. Largest of the Greek islands, it was the center of a great maritime civilization that flourished from about 2,700 to the fifteenth century. Modern archaeologists have called it Minoan after the mythical king of Crete, Minos.<br><br>His son died a mysterious but violent death while on a visit to Athens, possibly at the hands of Aegeus. Minos was enraged with grief. He fought and won a war of revenge against Athens and in compensation for his loss demanded the handover every nine years of seven young men and seven young women, chosen by lot. They were sent to Crete and imprisoned in a labyrinth where a monster half man and half bull lived, called the Minotaur. He was the product of an extramarital liaison between Minos&#x2019;s wife, Pasiphae, and a white bull with whom she had become infatuated. He killed all the captives.<br><br>Athenian public opinion was highly critical of Theseus. Here was the heir to the throne, a bastard and a foreigner, coming off scot-�free, while ordinary people&#x2019;s legitimate children were being sent to a dreadful fate. Theseus took the point and volunteered to be a member of the tribute group and destroy the Minotaur.<br><br>Being of a tricky frame of mind, he swapped two of the girls for a couple of pretty (but manly) boys; he softened their skins by warm baths, kept them out of the sun, got them to use makeup, gave them frocks, and trained them to walk in a feminine manner (we shall see later that this was not the only time a Greek used drag as a deadly ruse).<br><br>On previous occasions the ship carrying the captives had shown a black sail, as a sign of mourning. But Theseus promised that he would give the captain another sail, a white one, for him to hoist on the return voyage as a sign that he had killed the Minotaur.<br><br>Minos&#x2019;s daughter Ariadne fell in love with Theseus and showed him how to master the intricacies of the labyrinth. She gave him a ball of string, which he unwound as he walked along, thus enabling him to find his way back. As he had vowed, he put the Minotaur to death and cut off its head.<br><br>Theseus and the other boys and girls escaped from Crete. The now pregnant Ariadne and her sister came along with them, but they were dumped on the island of Naxos. Ariadne hanged herself in despair (or, according to another account, married on the rebound the wine god Dionysus, who was passing by).<br><br>As they approached Attica, Theseus and the ship&#x2019;s captain forgot to change the sails. When Aegeus saw the boat come into harbor sporting its black flag, he committed suicide by flinging himself off the Acropolis.<br><br>As we have seen, Theseus had a cheating, sometimes violent way with women. He and his best friend, a Thessalian called Pirithous, kidnapped Helen, later to be &#x201c;of Troy.&#x201d; He was fifty years old and she a prepubescent girl; he said he meant to keep her until she was old enough to marry and have sex with. But she was rescued and the plan failed.<br><br>Theseus joined in a war with the Amazons, a race of aggressive women who forswore men. Their queen, Hippolyta, was tricked into boarding Theseus&#x2019;s ship; he took her back to Athens where he married her. However, he soon put her away in favor of Ariadne&#x2019;s little sister, Phaedra.<br><br>Pirithous had the not-�so-�clever idea of going down into the underworld and kidnapping the Queen of the Dead, Persephone. He took Theseus along with him and the pair wandered around the outskirts of Tartarus, a deep abyss where the wicked are endlessly tortured. They were caught and led away to eternal punishment by the Furies, ancient goddesses of vengeance, who had snakes in their hair and whips in their hands. Both men were placed on the Chair of Amnesia; they grew into it and were held fast by coiled serpents. Here they were to live or partly live forever.<br><br>By a stroke of luck Heracles happened to be visiting. He was engaged on the last of his Labors, the capture of Cerberus, the three-�headed dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld. He persuaded Persephone to let bygones be bygones and Theseus was restored to the upper air. His comrade remained unforgiven and, for all we know, is still suffering.<br><br>On his return to Athens, the family atmosphere in the palace on the Acropolis became strained when Phaedra fell incestuously in love with Hippolytus, Theseus&#x2019;s son by Hippolyta. He rejected her advances. False evidence from Phaedra led the angry king to cause his son&#x2019;s death at the hands of the sea god Poseidon. She then killed herself out of guilt.<br><br>The Athenians were sure that Theseus was a historical figure. A thirty-�oared galley, said to be the ship on which he had sailed to and from Crete, was preserved and was still on public display in the fourth century. Its old timbers were replaced with new wood as they rotted away. This gave philosophers a handy conundrum for their pupils. When all the timbers had been exchanged, was the ship the same ship or a different one?</p><h2>4:50 from Paddington (Miss Marple Mysteries)</h2><p>Elspeth McGillicuddy believes that she has witnessed a murder aboard the 4:50 train from Paddington, but only Miss Marple is willing to investigate the crime.

Paperwhites at Thanksgiving. Crocus, amaryllis, and tulips for the holidays. Great vases of flowing forsythia filling rooms with spring---in the dead of February. It's all the magic of forcing bulbs, branches, and blossoms, and here's the book that shows how.<br><br>Written by award-winning author Katherine Whiteside and drawing on the plant- and bulb-purveying expertise of Smith &amp; Hawken, <i>Forcing, Etc.</i> combines hands-on-how-to with an artist's passion for detail to show how to grow dozens of common and exotic plants, including hardy bulbs--crocus, narcissus, muscari, and iris; tender bulbs--oxalis, calla lily, clivia; branches--apple and apricot to bittersweet, moosewood, and quince; and tender plants--fuchsia, coleus, clematis, lemongrass, and scented geraniums. In addition, the author focuses on presentation and display: choosing unexpected containers; creating tripods, trellises, and tuteurs; and orchestrating an indoor garden for balance of bloom and color.</p><p>What's a dyed-in-the-wool gardener to do when faced with stubborn Old Man Winter's downright refusal to let much of anything grow? Force it, that's what. Forcing is the art of convincing a bulb, branch, houseplant, or cutting to flower when it would otherwise be dormant. So when the drabness of winter and its attendant exorbitant price for cut flowers hits you, try forcing. <p> It's not difficult, but it does take some planning and foresight. If you want to force bulbs to flower in February, for instance, you have to order them in late summer so that you can pot them up in the fall. Twigs, on the other hand, are much easier to force: just cut them after six weeks of cold weather, put them in some water, and watch the virtual spring of your warm rooms transform them into leggy, flowering spirea, corylopsis, forsythia, or catkins, for instance. Author Katherine Whiteside explores associated topics such as choosing the best container and presentation within the home, as well as topics only an expert could love ("the narcissus question"). </p><p> <i>Forcing, Etc.</i> is a good read. It's not a reference book in the truest sense of the word; the lack of an index is at fault there. This doesn't mean that there's not an awful lot of good information here for beginners and adepts, well and entertainingly written. But when you want to check on the fertilizer ratio for your calla lilies, you'll have to page through the entire book to find it (in a very small typeface, too). But with Richard Felber's gorgeous photos on every page, maybe that's not such a bad thing to have to do. <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i></p>Exploring the world of paperwhites, potted hyacinths, and more, award-winning writer Katherine Whiteside combines hands-on how-to with a flower lover's enthusiasm in a forcing primer that's as complete as it is glorious.<p> Organized by plant type, FORCING, ETC covers dozens of common and exotic plants that are readily available and easily growable for the indoor gardener. Here are step-by--step instructions demystifying the techniques of forcing bulb into bloom by simulating autumn, deep winter, and early spring in an accelerated time frame.

Certainly not, according to our government.&nbsp;Despite the conquest of two sovereign states in as many years, despite the presence of more than 750 military installations in two thirds of the world&#x2019;s countries and despite his stated intention "to extend the benefits of freedom...to every corner of the world," George W. Bush maintains that "America has never been an empire." "We don&#x2019;t seek empires," insists Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. "We&#x2019;re not imperialistic."<p>Nonsense, says Niall Ferguson. In <b>Colossus</b> he argues that in both military and economic terms America is nothing less than the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. Just like the British Empire a century ago, the United States aspires to globalize free markets, the rule of law, and representative government. In theory it&#x2019;s a good project, says Ferguson. Yet Americans shy away from the long-term commitments of manpower and money that are indispensable if rogue regimes and failed states really are to be changed for the better. Ours, he argues, is an empire with an attention deficit disorder, imposing ever more unrealistic timescales on its overseas interventions. Worse, it&#x2019;s an empire in denial&#x2014;a hyperpower that simply refuses to admit the scale of its global responsibilities. And the negative consequences will be felt at home as well as abroad. In an alarmingly persuasive final chapter Ferguson warns that this chronic myopia also applies to our domestic responsibilities. When overstretch comes, he warns, it will come from within&#x2014;and it will reveal that more than just the feet of the American colossus is made of clay.</p></p><p>"The United States today is an empire&#x2014;but a peculiar kind of empire," writes Niall Ferguson. Despite overwhelming military, economic, and cultural dominance, America has had a difficult time imposing its will on other nations, mostly because the country is uncomfortable with imperialism and thus unable to use this power most effectively and decisively. The origin of this attitude and its persistence is a principal theme of this thought-provoking book, including how domestic politics affects foreign policy, whether it is politicians worried about the next election or citizens who "like Social Security more than national security." Ferguson, a British historian, has no objection to an American empire, as long as it is a liberal one actively underwriting the free exchange of goods, labor, and capital. Further, he writes that "empire is more necessary in the twenty-first century than ever before" as a means to "contain epidemics, depose tyrants, end local wars and eradicate terrorist organizations." The sooner America embraces this role and acts on it confidently, the better. Ferguson contrasts this persistent anti-imperialistic urge with the attitude held by the British Empire and suggests that America has much to learn from that model if it is to achieve its stated foreign policy objectives of spreading social freedom, democracy, development, and the free market to the world. He suggests that the U.S. must be willing to send money, civilians, and troops for a sustained period of time to troubled spots if there is to be real change&#x2014;as in Japan and Germany after World War II--an idea that many American citizens and leaders now find repulsive. Rather than devoting limited resources and striving to get complex jobs done in a rush, Americans must be willing to integrate themselves into a foreign culture until a full Americanization has occurred, he writes. Overall, a trenchant examination of a uniquely American dilemma and its implications for the rest of the world. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i>Niall Ferguson is Laurence A.

She had worked here for almost a year but never tired of the fresh fragrance of cinnamon and warm bread that greeted her as the tiny bell over the door announced her entrance. This clear spring afternoon she wasn&#x2019;t working. She was meeting friends. Glancing at the empty corner table by the front window, Sierra realized she was the first one to arrive for the Monday<br>afternoon gathering. For months she and her friends Vicki and Amy had bent their heads close together over that same table every Monday at four o&#x2019;clock. They shared secrets, settled arguments, gave free advice, and teased each other mercilessly.<br><br>Mrs. Kraus, the owner of Mama Bear&#x2019;s, called to Sierra from behind the counter. &#x201c;I just pulled out a pan of fresh rolls. Will you girls be sharing your usual large one with an<br>extra dab of frosting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we will,&#x201d; Sierra said. Six other customers were seated in the bakery, and Mrs. Kraus appeared to be the only person working in the front of the shop. &#x201c;Would you<br>like me to get the tea for us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I think I can remember what you always have. I&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d; The cheerful, round Mrs. Kraus turned to greet an older woman who had entered the shop.<br><br>Sierra settled her slim frame into her usual chair, welcoming the stream of sunshine that spilled through the window and cascaded down her long, blond curls. She loved the feelings of promise this time of year brought, especially this spring. It was her senior year in high school, and endless possibilities stretched out for her future. That was probably why she felt impatient for Amy and Vicki to show up. She had a very promising possibility to tell them<br>about.<br><br>Across the street a battered old Volvo pulled into a metered parking space. Sierra watched as petite Amy flipped her sunglasses onto the top of her head and fingered the ends of her short, dark hair at the base of her neck. Amy glanced right and left and then hurried across<br>the street. Her dash had a slight zigzag pattern to it. She kept her head down and didn&#x2019;t watch where she was going. <i>That&#x2019;s the way Amy approaches life</i>, Sierra thought, <i>zigzagging with<br>her head down. I&#x2019;ll have to tell her that.<br><br></i>&#x201c;Personality observations&#x201d; is what Vicki had first labeled these insights, when she communicated to Sierra that the way Sierra bit her lower lip was a sign of worry. Sierra<br>accepted the observation with grateful surprise. She had never realized she bit her lower lip.<br>Amy, however, wasn&#x2019;t interested in observations lately. The openness she had demonstrated in February was gone by the beginning of March, and it didn&#x2019;t seem to be returning. Sierra was just glad that, even though Amy hadn&#x2019;t been saying much during their get-togethers, at least she kept coming. Sierra had nearly lost her friendship with Amy once, and she didn&#x2019;t want that to happen again.<br><br>When Amy entered, Sierra smiled and waved. The pair had certainly experienced their ups and downs in their year of friendship. In spite of their differences, they respected and deeply cared for each other, and that&#x2019;s what kept them close.<br><br>&#x201c;Vicki&#x2019;s not here yet?&#x201d; Amy said, slipping into a chair across from Sierra.<br><br>Sierra shook her head. &#x201c;When I saw her at lunch, I told her I had something to tell you guys, so I thought she would be the first one here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Guess you&#x2019;ll have to tell me first, then,&#x201d; Amy said, her dark eyes glancing at Sierra&#x2019;s outfit. &#x201c;I like that shirt. When did you get it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Believe it or not, I found it stuffed in a bag Mom was taking to the Salvation Army. I think it was Tawni&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;m actually wearing something my sister liked!&#x201d;<br><br>Amy reached over and felt the sleeve of Sierra&#x2019;s lavender chenille top. &#x201c;I like this material. It sure brings out the blue in your eyes.&#x201d; Amy smiled as she added, &#x201c;If you get tired of it, you can always toss it in my direction.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Kraus arrived at their table, balancing a tray with their snack. Sierra reached for the mugs of hot tea, and Amy grabbed the plate with the cinnamon roll. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn to pay,&#x201d; Amy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring it up to the register, Mrs. Kraus.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No hurry. Just enjoy,&#x201d; Mrs. Kraus said.<br><br>The bell above the door announced Vicki&#x2019;s arrival. She swished past Mrs. Kraus and, with a flushed face, began to talk before she even sat down. &#x201c;Sorry! I was almost out ofgas, and I didn&#x2019;t have any money, so I had to go to the bank, and the line at the drive-up was terrible and, oh, you already ordered? I wanted iced tea today. I think I&#x2019;ll get myself a glass of ice and turn this into iced tea. Anyone else want anything?&#x201d;<br><br>Both Sierra and Amy shook their heads.<br><br>Vicki swept past the tables to the counter. Watching her, Sierra thought about the contrast between her two friends. If Amy zigzagged through life with her head down, Vicki moved through her days at full speed, with her chin to the sky and the wind in her long, silky, brown hair. That zestful optimism eventually had linked Sierra and Vicki, even though Sierra originally had interpreted Vicki&#x2019;s bold approach to life as conceit. Of course, when they first met, Vicki did have an overly active bent toward flirting and was far more interested in developing relationships with guys than with girls.<br><br>Amy pulled off a corner of the cinnamon roll. &#x201c;Do you suppose we can start eating without Vicki? I&#x2019;m starved.&#x201d; &#x201c;Sure. She&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; Sierra pulled her peppermint tea bag out of the mug. With a glance at Vicki, she wondered how her friends would describe her approach to life. Did they see her as a zigzagger or as someone with her face to the sun? She felt she had changed a lot during the past year, and she knew that Vicki and Amy had changed, too. What would they be like a year from now? Or even six months from now, when they all would begin their freshman year of college?<br><br>The instant Vicki returned to their table, Sierra spilled her news. &#x201c;Okay, are you both ready for my big announcement?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be that huge if you didn&#x2019;t tell me at lunch today and made me wait until now,&#x201d; Vicki said, carefully pouring her steaming tea over the glass of crushed ice.<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted to tell you both at the same time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate that,&#x201d; Amy said. Amy had changed schools this year after her parents&#x2019; divorce. She was at a public high school now, instead of at Royal Academy, the small, private Christian school where the three originally had met. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; Vicki prompted.<br><br>&#x201c;Last night my brother called and told me he&#x2019;s going to Southern California next week. He&#x2019;s pretty sure he wants to attend Rancho Corona University for his master&#x2019;s degree, but he wanted to check out the school before he made a final decision.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your big news?&#x201d; Vicki asked. Her pretty face took on a teasing grin. &#x201c;You definitely could have told me that at lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Sierra said, her enthusiasm unruffled. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to drive down there next week, and he asked if I wanted to go with him, and my parents said yes!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good for you,&#x201d; Vicki said. &#x201c;Bring back a surfer for each of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you go to California last year for Easter vacation?&#x201d; Amy asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you also flew down there for your friends&#x2019; wedding last summer.&#x201d; Amy turned her lower lip into a friendly pout. &#x201c;How do you expect us to be happy for you again? You keep going on these adventures, and we don&#x2019;t go anywhere. I&#x2019;ve never been to California&#x2013;ever&#x2013;in my life. I&#x2019;ve only been to Seattle&#x2013;once.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you have a good time,&#x201d; Vicki said cheerfully to Sierra.<br><br>Sierra broke into a wide grin. &#x201c;You mean you hope <i>we </i>have a good time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;We&#x2019; meaning you and Wes?&#x201d; Vicki ventured. &#x201c;Or &#x2018;we&#x2019; meaning the three of us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of us!&#x201d; Sierra spouted. &#x201c;My brother is driving my parents&#x2019; van down, and they said I could invite my friends to go. We should be able to get an excused absence from school, since it&#x2019;s a college scouting trip. Wes said he would let us check out as many different campuses as we want, as long as he can spend a day at Rancho Corona.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Vicki said without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation.<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of colleges?&#x201d; Amy asked cautiously.<br><br>&#x201c;Amy!&#x201d; Vicki nudged her arm. &#x201c;You just said you never get to go anywhere. Accept the invitation and say thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Amy hesitated a moment before saying, &#x201c;It <i>would </i>be kind of fun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When do we leave?&#x201d; Vicki asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Wednesday after school,&#x201d; Sierra said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to drive the van down to Corvallis, and then Wes and I will take turns driving from there. It&#x2019;s going to take us at least twenty hours, so we&#x2019;ll sleep in the van. In Los Angeles, we&#x2019;ll stay with a couple Wesley knows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is Rancho Corona University?&#x201d; Vicki asked. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Someplace down there. It&#x2019;s about an hour&#x2019;s drive from where my sister lives, so we might stay with her the next night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is going to be so much fun!&#x201d; Vicki sipped her iced tea and glanced at Amy for a sign of enthusiasm. <br><br>&#x201c;When do we come back?&#x201d; Amy asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Late Sunday night. It&#x2019;ll be a really packed couple of days, but I think it&#x2019;s going be great. You do want to come, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Amy nodded, but she still didn&#x2019;t look overly excited. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to get off work and clear everything with my mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Vicki said. &#x201c;But that shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for reminding me,&#x201d; Sierra said. &#x201c;I forgot I have to ask Mrs. Kraus for the days off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She always lets you adjust your schedule,&#x201d; Vicki said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be her sweet self and give you the time off. Now let&#x2019;s just pray my boss is as understanding.&#x201d;<br><br>Sierra laughed. &#x201c;Your boss? Why wouldn&#x2019;t he be?&#x201d;<br><br>Vicki&#x2019;s boss was her dad. Mr. Navarone owned a large car dealership in Portland, and Vicki worked there part time doing clerical work. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Vicki said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll let me off. My dad is going to be thrilled I&#x2019;m showing serious interest in going to college. He&#x2019;ll probably not only send me off with his blessing but also with enough spending money to treat everyone to a<br>trip to an amusement park down there.&#x201d;<br><br>Amy&#x2019;s expression lit up. &#x201c;Could we go do that? Really? How about Universal Studios? Do you guys think we could squeeze in a trip to Universal Studios? Or at least to Hollywood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why not,&#x201d; Sierra answered. &#x201c;Wes said we could plan whatever we wanted.&#x201d;<br><br>The three friends bent their heads close. As the spring sunshine lit their little corner of the world, they pulled apart their cinnamon roll and began to make plans for their upcoming road trip. Sierra felt a gleeful rush of anticipation and knew the next week and a half couldn&#x2019;t speed by fast enough for her.</p><h2>Seven Taoist Masters: A Folk Novel of China</h2><p>History and legend are interwoven in this tale of adventure that both entertains and instructs. Written by an unknown author, <i>Seven Taoist Masters </i> is the story of six men and one woman who overcome tremendous hardships on the journey to self-mastery. These characters and their teacher, Wang Ch'ung-yang, are all historical figures who lived in the Southern Sung (1127 1279) and Yuan (1271 1368) dynasties. Wang is regarded as the greatest patriarch of the Complete Reality school, a highly purified branch of Taoism having a strong affinity with Zen Buddhism. The novel brings to life the essentials of Taoist philosophy and practice, both through the instructions offered by Wang&#x2014;on topics such as the cultivation of mind and body, meditation techniques, and overcoming the four obstacles of anger, greed, lust, and drunkenness&#x2014;and through the experiences of the characters.</p><p>Eva Wong is an independent scholar and a practitioner of the Taoist arts of the Pre-Celestial Way and Complete Reality lineages. She has written and translated many books on Taoism and related topics, including&nbsp;<i>A Master Course in Feng-Shui; Tales of the Taoist Immortals;&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Taoism: An Essential Guide.</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>The Nativity</h2><p>In this beautiful book, warm and whimsical illustrations accompany excerpts from the King James Version of the Bible to tell the story of the birth of Jesus. &#x201c;Vivas&#x2019; delicate, sure watercolors are a reminder that the humbleness of these people made the event more extraordinary--that the story is not only about the long ago and far away but about people with familiar joys and troubles.&#x201d;--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><p>Hardcover edition 2005<br>0-15-205591-6<br>Previous paperback edition 1994<br>0-15-200117-4<br>JULIE VIVAS is illustrator of I Went Walking, Let&#39;s Go Visiting, the Mem Fox classics Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge and Possum Magic, and several other picture book titles. She lives in Australia.</p><h2>Augustus</h2><p>In the year 44 BC, when Julius Caesar was killed, Augustus was a mere teenager who had been adopted into Caesar&#39;s household. His reaction to Caesar&#39;s death was to step forward and proclaim himself Caesar&#39;s rightful successor. The Senate did not take him seriously, but over the following months he raised his own army and, after defeating Mark Antony in battle, became one of the three most powerful men in Rome. He was not yet 20 years old. Over the next ten years he consolidated his power, and finally overthrew the last of his rivals in 31 BC. From that moment on Rome became an empire, and Augustus its first emperor. This is the story of how one man rose to become the most powerful man in the world, and stabilised an empire that had been racked by decades of civil war.</p><p>Adrian Goldsworthy has a doctorate from Oxford University. His first book, THE ROMAN ARMY AT WAR, was recognised by John Keegan as an exceptionally impressive work, original in treatment and impressive in style. He has gone on to write several other books, which have sold more than a quarter of a million copies and been translated into more than a dozen languages. A full time author, he regularly contributes to TV documentaries on Roman themes.Goldsworthy is a master storyteller ... This is the account of the man who remade Rome in his image ... it&#39;s a tale that never loses it&#39;s appeal. -- Miles Russell * BBC HISTORY MAGAZINE * His depiction of Augustus&#39;s relationship with his legions is masterly. -- Robert Harris * SUNDAY TIMES * Patiently, imaginatively but without recourse to flashy surmise, Goldsworthy offers reappraisals that inspire confidence because of their balance and good sense. Such an elusive man is never going to leap off these pages but he does begin to live and breathe -- Noonie Minogue * THE TABLET * Adrian Goldsworthy does justice to the many sides of Augustus&#39;s character: devoted husband, ruthless politician, masterly tactician. He makes complex Roman politics digestible with generous illustrations; quotations from the emperor&#39;s own writings; a glossary to help with technical terms from Roman law and politics; a list of dramatis personae; helpful end-notes, index and bibliography... The biography mixes vivid anecdotes... with narrative detail of military and political developments. -- Cally Hammond * CHURCH TIMES * Adrian Goldsworthy&#39;s portrait is the most trustworthy we are likely to get -- Nicholas Shakespeare * DAILY TELEGRAPH &#39;Books for Christmas&#39; * Superb, unputdownable and scholarly -- Simon Sebag Montefiore * EVENING STANDARD * A timely biography of Augustus. He was Julius Caesar&#39;s adopted son who saw off his rivals and gave to Rome and its colonies a stability and a form of democracy which has a surprising significance to our own weary company of statesmen... 500 pages of solid and often exciting history -- Illtyd Harrington * CAMDEN NEW JOURNAL * Goldsworthy has made a name for himself writing biographies of the great and the good of the Roman world. A careful scholar, he wears his knowledge lightly and is a skilled narrator and engaging writer. He brings all these attributes to play in his biography of Augustus... Goldworthy&#39;s biography demolishes some of the half-truths and tales that dog any successful ruler, and his book also acts as a brilliant history of Rome under Augustus * GOOD BOOK GUIDE * Historian and biographer Goldsworthy (Caesar) showcases his deep knowledge of Ancient Rome in this masterful document of a life whose themes still resonate in modern times... A strong narrative emphasis ties the work together and is enriched by evocative details of Roman life, whether it be bathing practices, voting tendencies, or the contemporary significance of Virgil. Readers may be surprised to find ancient precedents for still-visible cultural phenomena, such as the celebrity status accorded to politicians, public delight in scandal, and leadership &#34;constantly reinforced by... propaganda.&#34;... the overall effect that Goldsworthy generates is of meeting a man whose life seems hardly distant from the modern experience. * PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (USA) * Goldsworthy has fashioned an engrossing account of this extraordinary man, pointing out his many contradictions; fiercely ambitious but publicly reluctant to accept state triumphs, his power built on the success of his legions but never an outstanding soldier himself, adulterous in the extreme but a determined public supporter of traditional marriage. Augustus has been somewhat neglected in recent years, and Goldsworthy skilfully and painstakingly builds his case for greater prominence using the detail of his daily conduct and administration expertly... This is an excellent biography, which succeeds in ranking Augustus once more high amongst the great leaders in world history. * HISTORICAL NOVEL SOCIETY * Goldsworthy examines the life of Augustus Caesar, who rose from obscurity to become Rome&#39;s first emperor and the most powerful and enduring in the history of the Empire. He killed and manipulated his way to the top, then reinvented himself as &#39;the father of his country&#39;, achieving peace and prosperity * ITALIA! * Authoritative and always interesting -- John Gray * NEW STATESMAN * Adrian Goldsworthy does not hesitate to describe Emperor Augustus as he really was: a mass-murderer and then a military dictator * i NEWSPAPER * Goldsworthy capably guides us over the rapids of modern scholarship... Goldsworthy is particularly sound on senatorial power struggles and the use of marriage to cement or break political alliances. Augustus was, incredibly, both brother-in-law and son-in-law of Antony, having previously married the under-age daughter of Antony&#39;s first wife -- Nicholas Shakespeare * DAILY TELEGRAPH * This is a very fine story, very skilfully told -- Peter Jones * LITERARY REVIEW * Goldsworthy&#39;s true expertise is as a military historian and this is what really gives his biography its strength and bite: his depiction of Augustus&#39;s relationship with his legions is masterly -- Robert Harris * SUNDAY TIMES * Goldsworthy admits that pinning Augustus down is a tricky task. But he never allows any aspect of the Augustan project to slip away. The focus shifts easily from Augustus&#39; military might to his love of poetry... He shines a light on the many contradictions of Augustus&#39; character... Goldsworthy doesn&#39;t hesitate to describe the emperor for what he was: a mass-murderer and then a military dictator. But he reminds us of Augustus&#39; charm and humanity too... Augustus took the Roman world from civil war to lasting peace and prosperity, and the mechanisms he used to obtain and maintain power were extraordinary. Like Goldsworthy&#39;s biography of Julius Caesar, this is essential reading for anyone interested in Ancient Rome. -- Natalie Haynes * THE INDEPENDENT * Embarrassed by his short stature Augustus is said to have worn build-up shoes. He also had a love of crude jokes and poems, which he wrote himself. He was one part of the ultimate power couple. Aged 24 and on the verge of great power he fell in love with the beautiful, clever Livia, who was 20. Both were already married and while Augustus had a daughter, Livia was pregnant by her first husband. Livia and Augustus married three days after she gave birth. Extraordinary... This vast accomplished book... is a book to read avidly but also dip into, to enjoy the huge range of characters and the events -- Jenny Selway * DAILY EXPRESS *</p><h2>Biblical Hermeneutics</h2><p><p><i>Biblical Hermeneutics</i> is a textbook for introductory courses in hermeneutics. I takes an interdisciplinary approach that is both balanced and practical with six major foci: the history of biblical interpretation, philosophical presuppositions, biblical genre, the uniqueness of Scripture, the practice of exegesis, and use of exegetical insights that will be lived and communicated in preaching and teaching.<br><br><i>Biblical Hermeneutics</i> is designed for students who have little or no knowledge of biblical interpretation. It provides, in one volume, resources for gaining a working knowledge of the multi-faceted nature of biblical interpretation and for supporting the practice of exegesis on the part of the student. The first chapter "A Student's Primer for Exegesis" by Bruce Corley gives the student a bird's eye view of the entire process. It becomes for the student a kind of template to which they will return again and again as they engage in the process of exegesis.<br><br>This revised edition of <i>Biblical Hermeneutics</i> contains seven new chapter that deal with the major literary genre of Scripture: law, narrative, poetry, wisdom, prophecy, Gospels and Acts, epistles, and apocalyptic. The unique nature of Scripture is presented in part three that addresses the authority, inspiration, and language of Scripture. The book contains two extensive appendices, "A Student's Glossary for Biblical Studies" and an updated and expanded version of "A Student's Guide to Reference Books and Biblical Commentaries. </p></p><p><b>&nbsp;Steve Lemke </b>es rector y profesor de Filosof�a y �tica en el Seminario Teol�gico Bautista de Nueva Orle�ns, Luisiana (EE.UU.).<br><br><b>Steve Lemke</b> is provost and professor of Philosophy and Ethics at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.</p><h2>Holy Terror in the Hebrides (Dorothy Martin Mysteries, No. 3)</h2><p>In the aftermath of a young American&#39;s fatal fall, Dorothy Martin discovers that everyone in her tour group visiting a Scottish isle had a grudge against the victim, in the third novel in an Agatha Award-winning series.</p><p>Jeanne M. Dams lives in South Bend, Indiana. A Notre Dame graduate and retired teacher, Ms. Dams is also the author of <em> The Body in the Transept, </em> winner of the Agatha Award for Best First "Malice Domestic" novel, and <em> Trouble in the Town Hall. </em> She is currently at work on Dorothy Martin's next investigation.Sixtyish Dorothy Martin, a widowed American now living in the English village of Sheresbury (Trouble in the Town Hall, 1996, etc.), happily accepts an invitation from friends Tom and Lynn Anderson to spend two weeks on the tiny island of Iona in Scotland. When Tom's illness delays the couple's departure, though, Dorothy makes the journey alone. Discovering that she's left the key to their cottage at home, Dorothy checks into a small hotel run by Hester and Andrew Campbell. A group from Illinois is also staying there--the winners of a contest to find the most community- dedicated members of various Chicago churches, with Rabbi Jake Goldstein subbing for a Quaker winner stricken with appendicitis. Iona is a stop on their tour, and no one seems happy about it--or with one another: Sister Teresa, a feminist nun in mufti; elegant Unitarian Grace Desmond; Hattie Mae Brown, a Baptist choir leader; Lutheran organist Chris Olafson; unctuous, unpopular youth leader Bob Williams; and short-fused garden-designer Janet Douglas, a Presbyterian. A sight-seeing excursion to Fingal's Cave makes a slow-moving Dorothy, arriving after others have left, the only witness when Bob Williams falls to his death from a rocky height. She becomes obsessed with the idea that the fall was murder, not accident, and spends the rest of her stay trying to prove it. Some interesting characters, a graphic description of a humongous storm, and a picture of the island's craggy isolation are well done. But Dorothy's relentless and self-absorbed maunderings, along with a nearly nonexistent plot, bring the third in this series closer to chatty travel guide than mystery. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This questio cannot be settled by philosophical argument. It is not simply granted to us. If we want to become free, we have to try through our own inner activity to overcome habits of thought and reach a point of view that recognizes no limits to knowledge, sees through all illusions, and opens the door to an experience of the reality of the spiritual world. <p>This is a special reprint of the acclaimed translation - by Michael Wilson - of Rudolf Steiner's classic work on thinking as a spiritual path.</p></p><p>RUDOLF STEINER (1861-1925) became a respected and well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, particularly known for his work on Goethe&#39;s scientific writings.

His multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, philosophy, religion, education (Waldorf schools), special education (the Camphill movement), economics, agriculture (biodynamics), science, architecture, and the arts (drama, speech and eurythmy).

He has written numerous books on evolution and Victorian science.A sweeping biography in which Desmond (The Ape's Reflexion, 1979, etc.) and Moore (The Post-Darwinian Controversies--not reviewed) illustrate not only the familiar Darwinian thesis that life evolves--that it depends on an interplay of nature and culture and of inherited and acquired traits--but also the contemporary thesis that all science is in some way autobiographical. On a personal level, the authors say, Darwin developed from a pleasure-loving descendant of doctors and industrialists into an adventurer who undertook a five-year voyage around the world, and then into a recluse, a mad scientist racked by a mysterious illness, possibly psychogenic in origin, ruefully observing in his ten children the weaknesses he believed they had inherited by his marrying his first cousin. Professionally, Darwin was an observer and collector, interested in geology and zoology, famous in his own day for his tireless study of barnacles, worm castings, and pigeons, reluctant to theorize or to affirm the principles of evolution that had been evident to his grandfather Erasmus and were confirmed by most of the scientific community. Placing Darwin in context, Desmond and Moore demonstrate how social and political forces (the role of Malthus, the political radicals associated with the Westminster Review) contributed to his reading of nature. They also show Darwin participating in the professionalization of science, which developed from a collection of pious, wealthy gentlemen amateurs into various specialized and secularized disciplines with their own hierarchies and competition. Longer and more wide-ranging than John Bowlby's Charles Darwin (1991), this neglects Darwin's major strength: his own powerful, vivid, and imaginative prose. While valuable for the insights it offers on the age, it is not a substitute for Darwin's own autobiography and journals.

She&#x2019;d be disappointed to see me now. Shaking. Just going without a fight.</p><p>The social worker, Mrs. MacAvoy, pulls out of the hospital parking lot while I play with the electric-lock button on her car door. <i>Lock. Unlock. Lock. Unlock.</i> She glares at me in the mirror and says, &#x201c;Please... stop that. The door needs to stay locked.&#x201d;</p><p>I love it when people use the word <i>please</i> but they sound like they want to remove your face. I stop. But I&#x2019;m not doing it to bug her like she thinks. It&#x2019;s just that I can&#x2019;t keep still. And it beats jumping out of a moving car.</p><p>My fingers play with my hospital bracelet. I stare at my name. Carley Connors. Thirteen letters. How unlucky can one person be?</p><p>I think about my mother. Still there, lying in her hospital bed like an eggplant. I wonder if she&#x2019;s conscious yet. I wonder why no one will tell me what&#x2019;s happening with her. And I wonder why I can&#x2019;t seem to ask anymore.</p><p>Gazing out the window, I count the trees. Connecticut is covered with them, but in March the branches are still bare. Like long, gray fingers waving us along as we speed by.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; Mrs. MacAvoy says, taking a corner faster than I think any social worker is supposed to.</p><p>I think back to sitting in that hospital bed, bunching the blankets up in my fists, asking her if they were going to send me to an orphanage. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t call them orphanages anymore,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, shaking her head and laughing. Like <i>that</i> was the point?</p><p>Now I&#x2019;m trapped in her car going to a place she&#x2019;s chosen. After what my stepfather has done, I&#x2019;m terrified thinking about what kind of foster house I may land in. The things that could happen to me.</p><p>I think of the Little Mermaid mural near the nurse&#x2019;s station. How the tooth fairy gave me that CD when I was seven, and my mother let me get up to listen when I found it under my pillow at midnight. We danced around the kitchen together. She sang &#x201c;Kiss the Girl&#x201d; as she chased me to get a kiss. I never once ran away for real.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Mrs. MacAvoy says, pulling me back to reality. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very lucky, Carley.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding me, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth bunches up. &#x201c;Well.&#x201d; She sounds like a ticking bomb. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a nice home. A good placement. You <i>are</i> lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Guess I should buy a lottery ticket then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someday, Carley, you&#x2019;re going to have to realize that being angry at the whole world only hurts you.&#x201d;</p><p>I wonder if that isn&#x2019;t the point.</p><p>We drive up to a house the color of dirt. Tall, thin trees surround it, like guards on watch. There is a &#x201c;66&#x201d; on the mailbox. A palindrome.</p><p>Mrs. MacAvoy opens the car door for me. &#x201c;This is a very nice family, <i>Carley</i>.&#x201d; She puts emphasis on my name as if to give me a warning. &#x201c;And this is the first time they&#x2019;ve taken a foster child...&#x201d;</p><p>I know this is her way of telling me to be a &#x201c;good girl.&#x201d; The walk up the driveway feels like wading through glue. I&#x2019;ve read books and seen movies. I know what foster parents are like. They smoke cigars and feed you saltines for breakfast.</p><p>One, two, three... seven, eight, nine. Standing on the porch, I count the leaves on the plastic wreath that hangs on the door. The bright redness of the flowers reminds me of the swirling lights of the ambulance. I have a vague memory of my mother screaming for me and my own voice trying to yell for her. And the taste of blood; I remember that.</p><p>I remember the blinding pain surging through my body and then feeling nothing at all. Wondering if a person like me would go to heaven.</p><p>I jump when the door swings open, and a woman smiles. She is the kind of person you&#x2019;d never look at twice. Her hair is shoulder length, straight, and different shades of brown. Her blue V-neck sweater matches her eyes, and she wears a silver leaf necklace and plaid pants. I mean, <i>plaid</i> pants?</p><p>She holds out her hand. &#x201c;Hello, Carley. How nice to meet you. I&#x2019;m Julie Murphy.&#x201d;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t reach back. Even the name feels fake. Too perky. I wonder why she&#x2019;s happy to meet me. I wonder how much she knows. And I hope that I do not like her.</p><p>Then this whole thing gets even worse.</p><p>Mrs. Murphy steps to the side. Behind her stand three boys. The smallest one runs over, stretching his hands up toward his mother, and she swoops him up.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t stay here. I&#x2019;m probably here to be a live-in babysitter or a modern-day Cinderella.</p><p>The oldest boy looks at me like he wants to wrap me in a carpet and leave me on the curb.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t cried since my mother told me she was going to marry Dennis. That was 384 days ago, but I want to cry now.</p><p>His mother tips her head to the side and holds my gaze until I just can&#x2019;t look anymore. I hear her voice. Soft. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come in, Carley?&#x201d;</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>The First Step</p><p>While Mrs. MacAvoy blathers on, Mrs. Murphy focuses on the bruises on my arms; her look of pity crawls inside of me. Clasping my hands behind my back, I try to hide my arms so she can&#x2019;t see.</p><p>The middle boy starts pulling Matchbox cars from his pants pockets and holds them against his chest. He&#x2019;s the dirtiest but seems the most serious, even with a head full of red curls.</p><p>The one in her arms is about four, I guess. He wears a plastic fireman&#x2019;s hat, little fire hydrant boxers, and bright yellow rain boots. A great blackmail picture when the kid&#x2019;s about sixteen.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Daniel,&#x201d; she says, pointing to the tallest one. &#x201c;And my redheaded car guy is Adam, and my littlest guy is Michael Eric. Say hi, guys!&#x201d;</p><p>I look at this family. A family I don&#x2019;t know. That I am supposed to stay with. I try to swallow my panic.</p><p>The whole place smells like dryer sheets. Reminds me of Lucky&#x2019;s Laundromat back in Vegas, but it isn&#x2019;t nearly as bright. The fireplace spans an entire wall in the step-down family room; the mantel is covered with St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day decorations.</p><p>Mrs. MacAvoy leaves, saying, &#x201c;Good luck.&#x201d; I wonder which one of us she&#x2019;s talking to.</p><p>When Mrs. Murphy closes the door behind her, she turns to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you settled in,&#x201d; she says. The idea of me settling in here is about as likely as an apple tree sprouting in my ear.</p><p>She picks up the backpack that Family Services gave me, which has a stuffed giraffe, a toothbrush, and a pair of bright yellow fairy pajamas that remind me that there are worse things than death. The stuffed giraffe is good, though. Anyone who has had her whole life shredded in one night should have a stuffed giraffe.</p><p>Mrs. Murphy takes me up the staircase. There are thirteen steps to the top, the tenth one being a squeaker. Soon we stand in a bedroom decorated in the theme of fire trucks. On the wall over the bed, there&#x2019;s a red wooden sign that reads BE SOMEONE&#x2019;S HERO in white letters, and I consider the cruel irony of sleeping under this phrase.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about the room. I know it isn&#x2019;t well suited to a girl your age. I moved Michael Eric in with Adam so you&#x2019;d have some privacy. You know, I assumed you&#x2019;d be a boy.&#x201d; She looks at me over her shoulder and seems a little embarrassed. &#x201c;I mean, I was surprised to hear that you were a girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, me too.&#x201d;</p><p>Straightening the corner of the bed, she laughs. &#x201c;What a clip.&#x201d;</p><p>I wonder what that means. I like it.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking. If you want to call me Julie instead of Mrs. Murphy, that would be fine. Not so formal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say, thinking that I don&#x2019;t want to call her Julie like we&#x2019;re friends. I don&#x2019;t want to call her anything. She seems okay, but I don&#x2019;t want someone else&#x2019;s family.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get Michael Eric and Adam cleaned up and start dinner. Mrs. MacAvoy said you&#x2019;d been asking for books at the hospital, so I put a bunch you may like on the top shelf there.&#x201d; She nods toward a bookcase.</p><p>I turn to look at them. Best thing so far.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re having lasagna for dinner. I hope that&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stouffer&#x2019;s or store brand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, no. I mean neither. I made it a couple of weeks ago and stuck it in the basement freezer.&#x201d; She seems embarrassed. &#x201c;So I guess you could say it&#x2019;s frozen, then?&#x201d;</p><p>She made it herself? Seriously?</p><p>Mrs. Murphy turns to go, closing the door behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; she answers, stepping back in.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a husband?&#x201d; I ask, staring at her wedding band and thinking of my stepfather, Dennis.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d; She sounds all singsongy. &#x201c;My husband, Jack, is working at the firehouse today, but he&#x2019;ll be home tomorrow morning. He knows you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p><p>I am afraid again. &#x201c;Okay. Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>She leaves, and soon I hear splashing from the bathroom and it sounds like there are ten boys in the tub instead of two. I stand at the door and want to go in but don&#x2019;t. I see the Murphys&#x2019; bedroom door is open, so I go in there instead.</p><p>The bed is high off the ground and has a woven canopy over it. There are pictures all over the room on tables and shelves. There&#x2019;s a man in a Navy uniform. There&#x2019;s also a wedding picture, and I see that the groom is the same as the Navy guy. I wish my mother had been married to my father.</p><p>The bathroom door opens behind me, and I feel like I&#x2019;ve been caught doing something wrong. I jump back into the table, and the Navy man picture smashes on the floor. I blurt out, &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carley. Never mind that. I&#x2019;ll clean it later. But be careful. Don&#x2019;t cut yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>I stare at her. When will she get mad?</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a little step stool in here,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come sit and join us?&#x201d;</p><p>What sounds like a plastic cup falls on the floor in the bathroom followed by a loud little-boy laugh. She pokes her head in. &#x201c;Michael Eric. Leave the water in the tub, honey.&#x201d;</p><p>Honey.</p><p>She turns toward me, waiting for an answer. I can see she becomes impatient as her gaze jumps between me and the bathroom.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say. I wonder if my mother is awake yet.</p><p>She seems to force a smile. &#x201c;The picture is no big deal. Jack hates it anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>My mouth dries up. I know I am not apologizing for the picture. I am sorry for being there in the first place.</p><p>Mrs. Murphy lets me skip dinner. Says it&#x2019;s only for the first night. I hear a happy family downstairs, talking and laughing, and I am relieved that I am not with them.</p><p>In the dark bedroom that is not my own, I count the wheels on the trucks over and over. I count the little firemen running around to help people. I stare at the hero sign and count the curves and lines of the letters. I wonder if, in my whole life, I could ever be someone&#x2019;s hero.</p><p>I think I hear my mother calling my name in the night, and I pull the covers up under my chin. I remind myself how she told me to never cry. How she and her friends would laugh at me when I did. How my mother would tell me that crying was for suckers, and that you can&#x2019;t be a sucker in Vegas.</p><p>I know that wherever my mother is, she has to be thinking about me, and I know I will go to her if she needs me, no matter what the state says. I hope...</p></p><h2>Twenty-four Italian Songs and Arias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries for Medium Low Voice (Schirmer&#39;s Library of Musical Classics, Vol. 1723) (English and Italian Edition)</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

Martin.</b><br><br>Lord Regent Geder Palliako's great war has spilled across the world, nation after nation falling before the ancient priesthood and weapon of dragons. But even as conquest follows conquest, the final victory retreats before him like a mirage. Schism and revolt begin to erode the foundations of the empire, and the great conquest threatens to collapse into a permanent conflict of all against all.<br>In Carse, with armies on all borders, Cithrin bel Sarcour, Marcus Wester, and Clara Kalliam are faced with the impossible task of bringing a lasting peace to the world. Their tools: traitors high in the imperial army, the last survivor of the dragon empire, and a financial scheme that is either a revolution or the greatest fraud in the history of the world.<br><br><b>The Dagger and the Coin</b><i>The Dragon's Path</i><i>The King's Blood </i><i>The Tyrant's Law</i><i>The Widow's House</i><i>The Spider's War</i><br><br>Writing as James S.

The traditional clothing and fabrics featured in this book were made and used in the islands of the Japanese archipelago between the late 18th and the mid 20th century. The Thomas Murray collection featured in this book includes daily dress, work-wear, and festival garb and follows the Arts and Crafts philosophy of the Mingei Movement, which saw that modernization would leave behind traditional art forms such as the hand-made textiles used by country people, farmers, and fisherman. It presents subtly patterned cotton fabrics, often indigo dyed from the main islands of Honshu and Kyushu, along with garments of the more remote islands: the graphic bark cloth, nettle fiber, and fish skin robes of the aboriginal Ainu in Hokkaido and Sakhalin to the north, and the brilliantly colored cotton kimonos of Okinawa to the far south. Numerous examples of these fabrics, photographed in exquisite detail, offer insight into Japan's complex textile history as well as inspiration for today's designers and artists. This volume explores the range and artistry of the country's tradition of fiber arts and is an essential resource for anyone captivated by the Japanese aesthetic.</p><p>THOMAS MURRAY is a dealer of Asian and tribal art and has an extensive personal collection of Japanese and Indonesian textiles.

Granted privileged access to Russia's secret archives, Edvard Radzinsky paints a picture of the Soviet strongman as more calculating, ruthless, and blood-crazed than has ever been described or imagined. Stalin was a man for whom power was all, terror a useful weapon, and deceit a constant companion. <br><br>As Radzinsky narrates the high drama of Stalin's epic quest for domination-first within the Communist Party, then over the Soviet Union and the world-he uncovers the startling truth about this most enigmatic of historical figures. Only now, in the post-Soviet era, can what was suppressed be told: Stalin's long-denied involvement with terrorism as a young revolutionary; the crucial importance of his misunderstood, behind-the-scenes role during the October Revolution; his often hostile relationship with Lenin; the details of his organization of terror, culminating in the infamous show trials of the 1930s; his secret dealings with Hitler, and how they backfired; and the horrifying plans he was making before his death to send the Soviet Union's Jews to concentration camps-tantamount to a potential second Holocaust. Radzinsky also takes an intimate look at Stalin's private life, marked by his turbulent relationship with his wife Nadezhda, and recreates the circumstances that led to her suicide. <br><br>As he did in <i>The Last Tsar</i>, Radzinsky thrillingly brings the past to life. The Kremlin intrigues, the ceaseless round of double-dealing and back-stabbing, the private worlds of the Soviet Empire's ruling class-all become, in Radzinsky's hands, as gripping and powerful as the great Russian sagas. And the riddle of that most cold-blooded of leaders, a man for whom nothing was sacred in his pursuit of absolute might--and perhaps the greatest mass murderer in Western history--is solved.</p><p>Granted privileged access to Russia&#39;s secret archives, Edvard Radzinsky has broken down the iron curtain of myth, secrecy and lies that has surrounded Stalin&#39;s life and career, painting a picture of the Soviet strongman as more calculating, ruthless and blood-crazed than has ever been described or imagined.Edvard Radzinsky is well-known in Russia as a popular historian, television personality, playwright, and screenwriter. His plays have been staged with the frequency of Chekhov&#39;s and have won international acclaim.

And in this brilliantly reasoned, thought-provoking work we learn why, as he demonstrates how far America has been detoured from its original path and led down the same road that Germany followed to Nazism. Self-sacrifice, Oriental mysticism, racial "truth," the public good, doing one's duty&#x2014;these are among the seductive catch-phrases that Leonard Peikoff dissects, examining the kind of philosophy they symbolize, the type of thinking that lured Germany to its doom and that he says is now prevalent in the United States. Here is a frightening look at where America may be heading, a clarion call for all who are concerned about preserving our right to individual freedom.</p><p><b>Leonard Peikoff</b>&nbsp;is the preeminent Ayn Rand scholar writing today. He worked closely with Rand in New York City for thirty years and was designated by her as heir to her estate. He has taught philosophy at several places, including Hunter College and New York University. Dr. Peikoff is the author of&nbsp;<i>The DIM Hypothesis: Why the Lights of the West Are Going Out</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cause of Hitler&#x2019;s Germany</i>. He grew up in Western Canada and now lives in Southern California. He also&nbsp;hosted the national radio talk show "Philosophy: Who Needs It."<p></p><p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>As Ayn Rand indicates in her introduction, this book demonstrates how German philosophy led to Hitler and the Holocaust.</p><p><i>The Cause of Hitler&#x2019;s Germany</i> is about two-thirds of <i>The Ominous Parallels</i>, a book of mine first published in 1982. In the book, I intended a warning: If Americans continue to accept and act on the same philosophic ideas that led to the Third Reich, then America will have to follow a parallel course and suffer the same result.</p><p>The book, accordingly, studied American culture and history in as much detail as that given to Germany. Given our cultural state, however, I did not expect any such warning to be heeded or even heard, and it wasn&#x2019;t. There is no improvement in the thirty years since, no change in the basic ideas ruling the United States (and the West as a whole). The Soviet Empire has collapsed, but the ideas of irrationalism, self-sacrifice, and collectivism still dominate and fuel murderous tyrannies, primarily now in the upsurging Middle East, but elsewhere, too.</p><p>Unlike <i>The Ominous Parallels</i>, this substantial portion of it is offered not primarily as a warning but rather as an explanation. To this day, Nazism remains vivid in the public mind as the greatest evil in human history, and continues to be the subject or background of countless novels, films, and nonfiction analyses. But the artists and scholars still have no real explanation; they are no closer than they were in 1982 to identifying the fundamental roots of Nazism.</p><p>For this reason, I agreed with the suggestion of Dr. Michael Berliner that I bring out this reduced version of my book. It was Dr. Berliner who first thought of such a possibility, who initiated the project, and who oversaw the development of its various stages. He wanted a book that would focus only on the Nazi aspects: on their intellectual origins in German philosophy, and then on their manifestations in Weimar culture and, as a result, in the world of Hitler. My approach to discovering the cause of Nazism is, I believe, unique and worthy of special attention; I am hopeful that this time it may reach its audience. If we are to survive today&#x2019;s world, some&#x2014;and ever more&#x2014;people must come to understand that abstract theory is what produces existential consequences, both personal and social.</p><p>Eleven of the sixteen chapters of <i>The Ominous Parallels</i> are included in this book. In omitting the other five chapters, I have eliminated a great deal: the material, analyzing our country&#x2019;s decline into an intellectually Germanized culture, thereby showing how and why the mind of the Enlightenment gave way to religion, pragmatism, and nihilism, all of it expressed by the shrinking of &#x201c;Americanism&#x201d; in our public&#x2019;s attitude, and by the ever-growing scale and power of our government. The solution, I argued, is to replace the philosophy of Kant and Hegel with the pro-reason, pro-individualism viewpoint of Ayn Rand.</p><p>I have made some minuscule changes to the original wording, cutting out a few lines here and there that refer to the omitted chapters.</p><p>Leonard Peikoff</p><p>Aliso Viejo, California</p><p>February 2013</p><p>P.S. If, after reading this book, you are interested in a broader and deeper discussion of the relationship between philosophy and culture/politics, I refer you to my latest book: <i>The DIM Hypothesis: Why the Lights of the West Are Going Out</i> (2012). But this book is technical and requires some background, so read the one in your hands first.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From Ayn Rand&#x2019;s 1980 Introduction to <br><i>THE OMINOUS PARALLELS</i></p><p>It gives me great pleasure to introduce the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself.</p><p>Perhaps the best recommendation I can give this book&#x2014;and its author, Dr. Leonard Peikoff&#x2014;is to say that it and he are not of today&#x2019;s cultural mainstream. They will be part of tomorrow&#x2019;s.</p><p>It is not necessary for me to prove that something is wrong with today&#x2019;s world. Everybody&#x2014;of any creed, color, or intellectual persuasion, old and young, rich and poor, conservative and liberal, foreign and domestic&#x2014;senses that something monstrous is destroying the world. But no one knows what it is, and people keep blaming one another&#x2014;with some justice.</p><p>As a symptom of today&#x2019;s cultural anxiety, observe the unusual interest in and the deluge of books dealing with Nazi Germany. Every sort of semi-plausible and wholly impossible theory has been offered in futile attempts to find the cause and explain the rise of Nazism. The failure of those explanations intensifies the quest: men seem to sense that the collapse of what had been a civilized country into such monstrous evil must be understood if we are to make certain that it will not be repeated. &#x201c;We dare not brush aside unexplained a horror such as Nazism,&#x201d; states Dr. Peikoff. If we do not know its causes, how can we be sure that our own country is not traveling the same road?</p><p>Dr. Peikoff answers these questions. He identifies the cause of Nazism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He demonstrates that there is a science which has been all but obliterated in the modern world. &#x201c;Yet this science determines the destiny of nations and the course of history&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;It is the science which had to be destroyed, if the catastrophes of our time were to become possible. The science is <i>philosophy.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>The non-modern (and non-old-fashioned) aspect of Leonard Peikoff&#x2019;s book is the breadth of his vision and the stunning scale of his philosophic integration. He does not share the concrete-bound, college-induced myopia of those alleged philosophers who study the various meanings of the word &#x201c;but&#x201d; (the contemporary empiricists)&#x2014;nor does he share the foggy stumbling and the floating abstractions of their predecessors (the rationalists). He presents the history of Germany&#x2019;s philosophy, in telling essentials.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then he presents the practical results&#x2014;the way in which philosophic ideas direct the course and shape the particular events of the history of [the Weimar Republic], as reflected in politics, economics, art, literature, education, etc.</p><p>This last is the cardinal achievement of Dr. Peikoff s book. While today&#x2019;s philosophy departments make it a loud point to proclaim that philosophy has nothing to do with practical life or with reality (which, they add, does not exist)&#x2014;Dr. Peikoff shows to their mangled victims what philosophy is, what it does, and how to recognize its influence all around us. He gives a virtuoso performance of shuttling effortlessly between abstractions and concretes&#x2014;keeping the first tied firmly to reality and thus illuminating the second. He shows that a nation brought up to regard the principles of duty and self-sacrifice as cardinal virtues will be helpless when confronted by a gang of thugs who demand obedience and self-sacrifice.</p><p>It is a tragic irony of our time that the two worst, bloodiest tribes in history, the Nazis of Germany and the Communists of Soviet Russia, both of whom are motivated by brute power-lust and a crudely materialistic greed for the unearned, show respect for the power of philosophy (they call it &#x201c;ideology&#x201d;) and spend billions of their looted wealth on propaganda and indoctrination, realizing that man&#x2019;s mind is their most dangerous enemy and it is man&#x2019;s mind that they have to destroy, while the United States and the other countries of the West, who claim to believe in the superiority of the human spirit over matter, neglect philosophy, despise ideas, starve the best minds of the young, offer nothing but the stalest slogans of a materialistic altruism in the form of global giveaways, and wonder why they are losing the world to the thugs.</p><p>As an example of why the cause of Nazism should be understood (but is not), I would like to mention a recent television interview with Helmut Schmidt, chancellor of West Germany. Asked to name his favorite philosopher, he answered&#x2014;in a changed tone of voice, a stiff, solemn, deaf-and-blind, heel-clicking tone&#x2014;&#x201c;Marcus Aurelius. He taught that we must do our duty above all.&#x201d; If he is typical of his country (and I believe he is), Germany has learned nothing.</p><p>The ineffable monster destroying the world is not an entity but a vacuum, an absence, the emptiness left by the collapse of philosophy. In that lightless emptiness, mindless men rattle frantically, bumping into one another, seeking desperately some way to exist on earth&#x2014;which they cannot find without the tool they have discarded. This leads to phenomena such as Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, as Dr. Peikoff demonstrates.</p><p>If you do not wish to be a victim of today&#x2019;s philosophical bankruptcy, I recommend <i>The Ominous Parallels </i>as protection and ammunition. It will protect you from supporting, unwittingly, the ideas that are destroying you and the world. It will bring order into the chaos of today&#x2019;s events&#x2014;and show you simultaneously the enormity of the battle and the contemptible smallness of the enemy.</p><p><i>The Ominous Parallels </i>offers a truly revolutionary idea in the field of the philosophy of history. The book is clear, tight, disciplined, beautifully structured, and brilliantly reasoned. Its style is clear and hard as crystal&#x2014;and as sparkling. If you like my works, you will like this book.</p><p>As to my personal reaction, I can express it best by paraphrasing a line from <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so wonderful to see a great, new, crucial achievement which is not mine!&#x201d;</p><p>Ayn Rand</p><p>New York, November 1980</p><p></p><p></p><p> 1 The Cause of Nazism</p><p>Here is the theory:</p><p>&#x201c;It is thus necessary that the individual should finally come to realize that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of his nation; that the position of the individual ego is conditioned solely by the interests of the nation as a whole&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that above all the unity of a nation&#x2019;s spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the ego to the conservation of the community, is really the first premise for every truly human culture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The basic attitude from which such activity arises, we call&#x2014;to distinguish it from egoism and selfishness&#x2014;idealism. By this we understand only the individual&#x2019;s capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for his fellow men.&#x201d;</p><p>These statements were made in our century by the leader of a major Western nation. His countrymen regarded his viewpoint as uncontroversial. His political program implemented it faithfully.</p><p>The statements were made by Adolf Hitler. He was explaining the moral philosophy of Nazism.1</p><p>And here is the ultimate practice (as described by William Shirer in <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich)</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;The gas chambers themselves [at Auschwitz] and the adjoining crematoria, viewed from a short distance, were not sinister-looking places at all; it was impossible to make them out for what they were. Over them were well-kept lawns with flower borders; the signs at the entrances merely said BATHS. The unsuspecting Jews thought they were simply being taken to the baths for the delousing which was customary at all camps. And taken to the accompaniment of sweet music!</p><p>&#x201c;For there was light music. An orchestra of &#x2018;young and pretty girls all dressed in white blouses and navy-blue skirts,&#x2019; as one survivor remembered, had been formed from among the inmates. While the selection was being made for the gas chambers this unique musical ensemble played gay tunes from <i>The Merry Widow </i>and <i>Tales of Hoffmann. </i>Nothing solemn and somber from Beethoven. The death marches at Auschwitz were sprightly and merry tunes, straight out of Viennese and Parisian operetta.</p><p>&#x201c;To such music, recalling as it did happier and more frivolous times, the men, women and children were led into the &#x2018;bath houses,&#x2019; where they were told to undress preparatory to taking a &#x2018;shower.&#x2019; Sometimes they were even given towels. Once they were inside the &#x2018;shower-room&#x2019;&#x2014;and perhaps this was the first moment that they may have suspected something was amiss, for as many as two thousand of them were packed into the chamber like sardines, making it difficult to take a bath&#x2014;the massive door was slid shut, locked and hermetically sealed. Up above where the well-groomed lawn and flower beds almost concealed the mushroom-shaped lids of vents that ran up from the hall of death, orderlies stood ready to drop into them the amethyst-blue crystals of hydrogen cyanide.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Surviving prisoners watching from blocks nearby remembered how for a time the signal for the orderlies to pour the crystals down the vents was given by a Sergeant Moll. <i>&#x2018;Na, gib ihnen schon zu fressen&#x2019; </i>(&#x2018;All right, give &#x2019;em something to chew on&#x2019;), he would laugh and the crystals would be poured through the openings, which were then sealed.</p><p>&#x201c;Through heavy-glass portholes the executioners could watch what happened. The naked prisoners below would be looking up at the showers from which no water spouted or perhaps at the floor wondering why there were no drains. It took some moments for the gas to have much effect. But soon the inmates became aware that it was issuing from the perforations in the vents. It was then that they usually panicked, crowding away from the pipes and finally stampeding toward the huge metal door where, as Reitlinger puts it, &#x2018;they piled up in one blue clammy blood-spattered pyramid, clawing and mauling each other even in death.&#x2019;&#x201d;2</p><p>The Nazis were not a tribe of prehistoric savages. Their crimes were the official, legal acts and policies of modern Germany&#x2014;an educated, industrialized, <i>civilized </i>Western European nation, a nation renowned throughout the world for the luster of its intellectual and cultural achievements. By reason of its long line of famous artists and thinkers, Germany has been called &#x201c;the land of poets and philosophers.&#x201d;</p><p>But its education offered the country no protection against the Sergeant Molls in its ranks. The German university students were among the earliest groups to back Hitler. The intellectuals were among his regime&#x2019;s most ardent supporters. Professors with distinguished academic credentials, eager to pronounce their benediction on the F�hrer&#x2019;s cause, put their scholarship to work full time; they turned out a library of admiring volumes, adorned with obscure allusions and learned references.</p><p>The Nazis did not gain power against the country&#x2019;s wishes. In this respect there was no gulf between the intellectuals and the people. The Nazi party was elected to office by the freely cast ballots of millions of German voters, including men on every social, economic, and educational level. In the national election of July 1932, the Nazis obtained 37 percent of the vote and a plurality of seats in the Reichstag. On January 30, 1933, in full accordance with the country&#x2019;s legal and constitutional principles, Hitler was appointed chancellor. Five weeks later, in the last (and semi-free) election of the pre-totalitarian period, the Nazis obtained 17 million votes, 44 percent of the total.</p><p>The voters were aware of the Nazi ideology. Nazi literature, including statements of the Nazi plans for the future, papered the country duri...</p></p><h2>Drawing From Memory</h2><p>DRAWING FROM MEMORY is Allen Say's own story of his path to becoming the renowned artist he is today.

He studied at Leipzig, where he showed interest in the occult, and at Strassburg, where Herder introduced him to Shakespeare&#x2019;s works and to folk poetry. He produced some essays and lyrical verse, and at twenty-two wrote <b>G�tz von Berlichingen</b>, a play which brought him national fame and established him in the current Sturm und Drang movement. This was followed by the novel <b>The Sorrows of Young Werther</b> in 1774, which was an even greater success.<p>Goethe began work on <b>Faust</b>, and <b>Egmont</b>, another tragedy before being invited to join the government of Weimar. His interest in the classical world led him to leave suddenly for Italy in 1786 and the Italian Journey recounts his travels there. <b>Iphigenia in Tauris</b> and <b>Torquato Tasso</b>, classical dramas, were written at this time. Returning to Weimar, Goethe started the second part of <b>Faust</b>, encouraged by Schiller. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. During this late period he finished his series of Wilhelm Master books and wrote many other works, including <b>The Oriental Divan</b> (1819). He also directed the State Theatre and worked on scientific theories in evolutionary botany, anatomy and color. Goethe completed <b>Faust</b> in 1832, just before he died.<br><b>W.H.

On visits to the great cities of Europe-monumental Rome; the intellectually explosive Paris of Peter Abelard and Thomas Aquinas; the hotbed of scientific study that was Oxford; and the incomparable Florence of Dante and Giotto-acclaimed historian Thomas Cahill brilliantly captures the spirit of experimentation, the colorful pageantry, and the passionate pursuit of knowledge that built the foundations for the modern world.</p><p><b>Thomas Cahill's</b> appealing approach to distant history has won the attention of millions of readers in North America and beyond. Cahill is the author of four previous volumes in the Hinges of History series: <i>How the Irish Saved Civilization</i>, <i>The Gifts of the Jews</i>, <i>Desire of the Everlasting Hills</i>, and <i>Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea</i>. They have been bestsellers, not only in the United States but also in countries ranging from Italy to Brazil. He and his wife, Susan, also a writer, divide their time between New York and Rome.One<br><br><b>Bingen and Chartres, Gardens Enclosed</b><br><br><i>The Cult of the Virgin and Its Consequences</i><br><br>In the first decade of the twelfth century, a little girl from the Rhineland town of Bermersheim, near Mainz, was offered by her parents as a sacrifice to God. Her name was Hildegard; her parents were Hildebert and Mechthild, a pious knight and his pious, well-born wife. Hildegard was eight years old when she was left for life with an anchorite named Jutta von Sponheim, who lived alone in a cell attached to the abbey church of Saint Disibod. (Disibod was a whimsical Irish monk-bishop of the seventh century who, disappointed at the lack of response to his preaching by his own countrymen, traveled to the Rhineland, became a prot�g� of the English Saint Boniface, evangelist to the Germans, and founded Disibodenberg, where he seems to have been rather more successful than he&#x2019;d been in his native land.) Not only does Hildegard&#x2019;s story embody many of the cultural currents that reached their ebb in her time or soon after; this outwardly obedient daughter, her childhood cut so cruelly short, was destined to become one of the most important women of her age.<br><br>Using a living child as a religious oblation was no Christian invention. Greeks and Romans had ancient traditions of chaste priestesses and Vestal Virgins; and in the oldest records of both pagans and Jews we find evidence of &#x201c;set-asides,&#x201d; human offerings devoted to a divinity. In the earliest archeological records, these offerings are literal human sacrifices, such as the bog burials of Scandinavia. Jewish tradition yields such offerings in surprising numbers, starting with Abraham&#x2019;s willingness to sacrifice his only son and continuing through Joshua&#x2019;s command to his troops to &#x201c;devote&#x201d; the people of Canaan to God under &#x201c;the curse of destruction&#x201d;&#x2014;that is,to execute them. In later times, prisoners of war were no longer slain outright, but firstborn males still had to be &#x201c;consecrated to the Lord&#x201d; and then &#x201c;redeemed&#x201d; by an animal sacrifice that was substituted for them, as happens to the newborn Jesus in the second chapter of Luke&#x2019;s Gospel. There is even a further echo of Jewish tradition in the offering of Hildebert and Mechthild, for Hildegard was their tenth child&#x2014;and a tenth of one&#x2019;s wealth, the tithe of the Hebrews, was consecrated to God.<br><br>But none of these grand historical precedents would have impressed an eight-year-old, who must have spent many a lonely, creepy night tucked away in Jutta&#x2019;s sparsely appointed little hut. Anchorites are no longer an everyday occurrence&#x2014;I have met only one in my life, and she was nutty as a fruitcake&#x2014;but in the twelfth century they could be encountered in the neighborhood of many a monastery and even within the close of an urban cathedral. The word anchorite derives from a Greek verb meaning &#x201c;to withdraw&#x201d;; and we may best think of them as hermits who lived not in obscure caves but in association with a religious community. Your typical anchorite, though not necessarily a formal member of such a community, was nonetheless part and parcel of its sacred landscape, so much so that she (or he) would normally reside in a small room built into the wall of an abbey church or cathedral, a room with a view, so to speak&#x2014;a slit or screened window that allowed the anchorite to attend church services but not so large as to make her visible to the merely curious.<br><br>The liturgy for the consecration of an anchorite was actually a funeral liturgy, for it was deemed that she was dying to the world and to herself. She was spoken of as already dead and with God in heaven. Her cell was called frankly her &#x201c;burial chamber,&#x201d; and, dressed in her shroud, she was directed to sing a verse from Psalm 132: &#x201c;This is my resting place forever, here shall I dwell for I have chosen it.&#x201d; The ceremony, attended gregariously by family, friends, and monastic benefactors, must strike us as a ghoulish sort of celebration, often ending with the ritual interment of the anchorite in her cell, from which it was expected that she would never again emerge. Brick was cemented on brick till the doorway to the cell was blocked and only the slit was left, enough for food and other necessities to be passed to her. If the ceremony did not conclude with an immuring, it concluded with a permanently locked door. But because this period is characterized by such variation in custom from one locality to another, we cannot be certain what was done in Hildegard&#x2019;s case, nor whether the growing girl was permanently locked away in thecustomary single room. We do possess one odd detail that may bespeak a certain mitigation: at least one servant was locked in along with the anchorites. Jutta and Hildegard were, after all, noblewomen and so could not be expected to manage even their much-reduced needs by themselves.<br><br> The idea was to serve God by permanent prayerful retreat from the world. However bizarre this may sound to modern ears, we probably all know a few people whose apartness (or even madness) might be better served if such a socially approved role were still available. Though often represented as a period of repression, heavy with superstition, the Middle Ages offered&#x2014;at least in religious roles&#x2014;more options than are now allowed. I doubt that a frail suppliant, plainly dressed and with a distracted air, approaching a bishop today to say that God had instructed her to build a cell into the wall of his cathedral and to carve in that wall a small window from which she could hear mass, as well as the canonical hours, would receive a warm response. But in the Middle Ages such social oddities were welcomed and assigned a place of honor. While the rest of us went about our worried lives, they prayed for us continually, speaking always to God on our behalf.<br><br>The masters of the Middle Ages had, of course, another, less public motive for honoring anchorites. The batlike monks of the Prologue who terrorized the citizens of Alexandria might have been politically useful to the patriarch, but as time went on such mobs, vociferous, usually illiterate, became a religious plague. They could not be appeased by compromise; they were rabble-rousing extremists, unswervingly certain of their rectitude. Their implacable attitudes gave bishops, as well as other public men in charge of social order, terrible headaches. How were they to be quieted? By being brought under the bishop&#x2019;s control, by being made subject to his rules and approval.<br><br>Every monkish mob was incited by a leader, often a desert hermit cherished for his holy ability to live apart from society, eating locusts, whipping his body, gifted with extravagant visions. The word monk derives, in fact, from the Greek word monos, meaning &#x201c;alone, lonely, solitary.&#x201d; In the rudimentary beginnings of monastic life, all monks were hermits, and only gradually did they unite in loose association with one another. Bishops began to invite the most influential solitaries to take up more conventional habitats, closer to human society and more readily subject to episcopal pressure. Monks and nuns, monachi and monachae, were made to write constitutions by which their communities were to be governed. In time, such constitutions came to be submitted to a bishop for his approval.<br><br>In the West, Saint Benedict, Italian founder of the Benedictines, became in the early sixth century the great constitutionalist, his Rule the standard by which all subsequent monasticism was judged. The monk&#x2019;s life was utterly subject to his dictum Ora et labora (Pray and work). No rabble-rousing, please. Let anarchy be not so much as mentioned among us. In time, obedience, tranquility, and constructive employment&#x2014;building, farming, herbal medicine, relief for the poor, succor for the sick, hospitality to wayfarers, manuscript copying, and (in the case of a gifted few) original writing&#x2014;not vision, came to rule the Christian West. The Benedictines, in addition to vows of obedience, chastity, and community of goods, took a vow of stability, which meant they could not leave the monastery grounds without their abbot&#x2019;s permission. Even prayer was measured out at appointed hours. No moment of the monk&#x2019;s day or night belonged exclusively to him. The bishops, who&#x2014;thanks to the barbarians&#x2014;had quite enough on their plates, required such a church, where everyone, even a visionary hermit, could be counted on to play an assigned role and to stay within prescribed limits.<br><br>No one had done so much to spread the fame of Saint Benedict as Gregory the Great, who was himself a Benedictine monk and had written Benedict&#x2019;s Life. By Hildegard&#x2019;s day, even an abbey like Disibodenberg, originally a foundation of Celtic spontaneity, had submitted to the Rule of Saint Benedict. In the abbey church, the monks sang the canonical hoursa&#x2014;as did all Benedictines from Britain to Bohemia&#x2014;and from a lancet opening in the choir wall a single female voice united with theirs in chant. One day, a pure child&#x2019;s voice joined in, inflecting the Latin words precisely, ascending gloriously and certainly to the subtle rhythm of the music. In their choir stalls the monks shivered with emotion: it was the voice of the child anchorite, the noble Hildegard.<br><br>We know little of what went on in Jutta&#x2019;s cell, but we know the results. Under the older woman&#x2019;s tutelage, the child learned to read the Book of Psalms in Latin and to sing the psalms of the monastic hours, the church&#x2019;s Divine Office, while accompanying herself on the expressive ten-string psaltery, a sort of dulcimer plucked by hand.Throughout her life Hildegard&#x2019;s Latin remained odd, at moments an almost private language. But her grasp of the principles of musicology was remarkable, eventually impelling her to compose her own chants, unusual in sound and singular in subject matter.<br><br>Beyond the Book of Psalms, Hildegard&#x2019;s adult writings&#x2014;a substantial survival&#x2014;show evidence of reading so wide as to rival and even surpass that of the most accomplished scholars of her time. She makes reference to the other books of the Bible, especially the Prophets,to the usual biblical commentaries, to liturgical texts, to the Benedictine Rule, and to the Western fathers&#x2014;Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, and Bede. Her Plotinian Platonism probably came to her by way of the ninth-century Irish philosopher John Scotus Eriugena, whose sermons and ruminations were standard texts, and she seems to have read reforming contemporaries, such as Hugh of Saint Victor and Bernard of Clairvaux, as well as earlier Christian classics, such as the Shepherd of Hermas and Adso&#x2019;s On the Antichrist. Some have speculated that there are hints in her writings of such Carolingianb authors as Isidore of Seville, Rabanus Maurus, Paschasius Radbertus, and Notker of Saint Gall; and there are strong suggestions that she had access to Greek (and perhaps to Arabic) medical works and even to arcane rabbinical treatises. This, for an age in which books were scarce and precious, is an astounding catalogue, a library available to few men and to (so far as we can tell) no other woman. The library must have belonged not to Jutta, who could hardly have accommodated it in her hut, but to the liberally lending monks of Disibodenberg. What went on in Jutta&#x2019;s cell was a lifetime reading program.<br><br>But what of the eight-year-old who was made to live in such unnatural confinement and who survived the rigorous reading program&#x2014;and even flourished because of it? Does anything of her&#x2014;anything personal, peculiar, intimate&#x2014;remain in the historical record? To answer these questions we must step back a bit and consider more widely the currents of twelfth-century life, not nearly as open as ours to personal preference and psychological insight.<br><br>Life spans had not increased since the classical centuries; indeed, they had dipped dramatically during the terrifying uncertainties of the barbarian influx and were only now&#x2014;in the new economic and cultural stability of twelfth-century Europe&#x2014;beginning to approach the best Greco-Roman levels. An eight-year-old, even a child of privilege such as Hildegard, was not as young in the eyes of her parents as she would be in ours. At the same age, her lesser-born male contemporaries were preparing for apprenticeships in the homes of strangers&#x2014;millers, bakers, chandlers, glaziers, fullers, coopers, wainwrights, and such&#x2014;and many of her female contemporaries, already betrothed, were beginning to contemplate their coming roles as matrons of households. Hildegard was thought quite old enough to make a lifetime commitment.<br><br>But should we assume that Hildebert and Mechthild forced their daughter into an anchorite&#x2019;s life? In Scivias, the book by which she is best known, Hildegard would counsel parents on the utter necessity of obtaining their child&#x2019;s consent before offering him as an oblation. &#x201c;If you offer a child to Me,&#x201d; says the voice of Jesus, and that offering is against his will because you have not sought his consent to it, you have not acted rightly; you have offered a ram. How? If someone offers a ram at My altar without binding its horns strongly with ropes, the ram will certainly run away. So also if a father or mother offer their child, who is the ram, to My service, but do not honor his will, which is his horns, by assiduous care or supplication or entreaty or diligent exhortation, which are the ropes that bind him, since by all these the child should be brought to consent in good will; not having been proved by these tests, he will certainly run away, physically or mentally, unless God guards him by miracle.<br><br>And if you, O human, confine that child with such great strictness of bodily discipline that he cannot free himself from the pressure of his will&#x2019;s repugnance, he will come before Me [at the Last Judgment] arid and fruitless in body and soul because of the captivity unjustly inflicted on him without his consent. Then I will say to you, O human who has bound him:<br><br>I had a green field in My power. Did I give it to you, O human, that you might make it put forth whatever fruit you wished? And if you sow sand in it, can you make it grow into fruit? No. For you do not give the dew, or send forth the rain, or confer fresh moisture, or draw warmth out of the burning sun, all of which are necessary to produce good fruit. So too, you can sow a word in human ears, but into his heart, which is My field, you cannot pour the dew of compunction, or the rain of tears, or the moisture of devotion, or the warmth of the Holy Spirit, through all of which the fruit of holiness must grow.<br><br>And how did you dare so rashly to touch one dedicated and sanctified to Me in baptism, that without his will you handed him over to bear My yoke in strict captivity; so that he became neither dry nor green, not dying to the world or living in the world? Why have you so oppressed him that he can do neither? If I comfort him by miracle so that he may remain in the spiritual life, that is not for humans to look into; for I want his parents not to sin in his oblation, offering him to Me without his will.</p><h2>Help for Your Fearful Dog: A Step-by-Step Guide to Helping Your Dog Conquer His Fears</h2><p>Is your dog afraid of strangers?

Now fully revised and updated, Robinson's renowned guide proves once again that learning about wine can be just as engaging as drinking it.<br><br>What better way to learn about wine than to taste it?<br> <br>Written in Robinson's trademark accessible style, the new <i>How to Taste</i> features thoroughly updated vintages and producers as well as up-and-coming wine regions and styles. Incorporating wines that are both easily obtainable and reasonably priced, Robinson's lessons are separated into complementary portions of theory and practice to help you both learn and taste your way to wine expertise.<br> <br>One of the world's best-loved authorities on wine, Robinson explains first how to get the most out of the flavor of your wine and food, and then about specific grapes and the wines themselves. By the time you finish the book, you will have learned how to recognize the most popular grape varieties from Chardonnay and Riesling to Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon, and why a good sparkling wine is always better than cheap champagne. You will discover how to judge sweetness, acidity, and fruitiness as well as the difference between the length and the weight of a wine. You will also be given practical advice for dealing with wine in the real world: how to choose from a wine list, organize your own wine tastings, and pair wines with specific foods.<br> <br>From the armchair to the wine shop and back to the table, <i>How to Taste</i> will transform anyone on any level into a confident connoisseur who can leave faltering sips behind and have fun along the way.</p><p>Whether Montessori or Merlot, kindergarten or Cabernet, the importance of a good instructor during the formative years is crucial. That's why newcomers to the world of wine could do a lot worse than having a corkscrew in one hand and a copy of Jancis Robinson's <i>How to Taste</i> in the other. A revision of 1983's <i>Masterglass</i> and published in the U.K. under the superior title <i>Jancis Robinson's Wine-Tasting Workbook</i>, <i>How to Taste</i> is a primer by a certified Master of Wine and star of the PBS series <i>Jancis Robinson's Wine Course</i>. From acidity to Australian Shiraz, oak to Oregon Pinot, Robinson delivers chapters of information and theory, intermingled with shaded "Practice" exercises, presented in a style as off-dry as one of the author's beloved Rieslings (the tannin in a lesser vintage Barolo is "like sucking on a matchstick"). Sometimes tuition at Jancis U. runs high: the lesson on sugar/acid balance culminates with expensive Sauterne "Practice." And even if Robinson risks, by dropping words like "charred" and "umami" early in the book, sending novices back to tear open a fresh box of Franzia, vinous virgins are encouraged to stick with it. By the time they get to the glossary at book's end, they'll be identifying wines at blind tastings with professional accuracy--which, Robinson encouragingly reveals, and she ought to know, is about 50 percent. <i>--Tony Mason</i><b>Jancis Robinson</b> is one of the world's best-loved authorities on wine.

One reason she has become a timeless icon of mystery for many readers is that her developmental phases have not been clarified. In this exhaustively researched biography, Alfred Habegger presents the first thorough account of Dickinson&#x2019;s growth&#x2013;a richly contextualized story of genius in the process of formation and then in the act of overwhelming production.<br><br>Building on the work of former and contemporary scholars,<b> My Wars Are Laid Away in Books</b> brings to light a wide range of new material from legal archives, congregational records, contemporary women's writing, and previously unpublished fragments of Dickinson&#x2019;s own letters. Habegger discovers the best available answers to the pressing questions about the poet: Was she lesbian? Who was the person she evidently loved? Why did she refuse to publish and why was this refusal so integral an aspect of her work? Habegger also illuminates many of the essential connection sin Dickinson&#x2019;s story: between the decay of doctrinal Protestantism and the emergence of her riddling lyric vision; between her father&#x2019;s political isolation after the Whig Party&#x2019;s collapse and her private poetic vocation; between her frustrated quest for human intimacy and the tuning of her uniquely seductive voice.<br><br>The definitive treatment of Dickinson&#x2019;s life and times, and of her poetic development, <b>My Wars Are Laid Away in Books</b> shows how she could be both a woman of her era and a timeless creator. Although many aspects of her life and work will always elude scrutiny, her living, changing profile at least comes into focus in this meticulous and magisterial biography.</p><p>In an excellent literary biography that matches the standard set by his earlier book, <i>The Father: A Life of Henry James, Sr.</i>, Alfred Habegger brings a modern perspective to bear on the life and art of the great American poet Emily Dickinson (1830-86) while respecting and lucidly conveying her own distinctively 19th-century views. Like the groundbreaking 1970s feminist reassessments of Dickinson, this text avoids portraying her as a quaint, ladylike homebody (the stereotypical "Belle of Amherst"), and instead stresses her powerful personality and the strategies she employed to transcend the limits placed on her by Victorian society and a domineering father. Even though as an unmarried woman she was expected to stay close to home, Dickinson opted for a life of seclusion, thereby avoiding the social responsibilities foisted upon middle-class women of her day. Habegger does not minimize the fact that Dickinson was a very peculiar woman, particularly as he chronicles the middle years during which her unconventional attitudes hardened into the mannerisms of a local "character." But his primary focus is always on the genius that transformed her personal dilemmas into art. His sensitive, acute handling of her writings, with frequent quotations and careful analysis, fulfills one of the key functions of a literary biography: it makes you want to run out and reread Emily Dickinson's poetry right away. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Alfred Habegger, formerly a professor of English at the University of Kansas, lives with his wife, Nellie, in northeastern Oregon. His previous books include <b>Gender, Fantasy, and Realism in American Literature</b> an da prize-winning biography, <b>The Father: A Life of Henry James, Sr.</b></p><h2>The Sweet Science</h2><p><p>A.J. Liebling's classic <i>New Yorker</i> pieces on the "sweet science of bruising" bring vividly to life the boxing world as it once was. It depicts the great events of boxing's American heyday: Sugar Ray Robinson's dramatic comeback, Rocky Marciano's rise to prominence, Joe Louis's unfortunate decline. Liebling never fails to find the human story behind the fight, and he evokes the atmosphere in the arena as distinctly as he does the goings-on in the ring--a combination that prompted <i>Sports Illustrated </i>to name <i>The Sweet Science</i> the best American sports book of all time.</p></p><p><p><b>A.

His greatest work is collected in <i>Just Enough Liebling</i>. </p><p><b>Robert Anasi</b> is the author of <i>The Gloves</i>.</p>Grover Gardner is the perfect narrator for this collection of Lieblings New Yorker pieces about boxing, written in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Featured are Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sandy Sadler, Archie Moore, Rocky Marciano, Jersey Joe Walcott--all fighters of Americas golden age of pre-television boxing. No one else has ever written so well about this sport. Gardner captures the voices of know-it-all New York fight fans and the denizens of the Neutral Corner, a New York City bar owned, tended, and patronized by fighters and their retinue. Gardners rendition of Tommy Farr, the Welsh heavyweight, alone is worth the purchase price. Those who love boxing, and even those who dont, will enjoy the Liebling-Gardner team.

Lost. Stuck in a daily grind of overflowing calendars, grueling small talk, and sprawling traffic. She&#x2019;d done everything &#x201c;right,&#x201d; but she felt all wrong. What&#x2019;s the worse failure, she wondered: smiling and staying the course, or blowing it all up and running away? And are those the only options?<br> <br>In this memoir-in-essays full of spot-on observations about home, work, and creative life, Philpott takes on the conflicting pressures of modern adulthood with wit and heart. She offers up her own stories to show that identity crises don&#x2019;t happen just once or only at midlife; reassures us that small, recurring personal re-inventions are both normal and necessary; and advises that if you&#x2019;re going to faint, you should get low to the ground first. Most of all, Philpott shows that when you stop feeling satisfied with your life, you don&#x2019;t have to burn it all down and set off on a transcontinental hike (unless you want to, of course). You can call upon your many selves to figure out who you are, who you&#x2019;re not, and where you belong. Who among us isn&#x2019;t trying to do that?<br> <br>Like a pep talk from a sister, <i>I Miss You When I Blink</i> is the funny, poignant, and deeply affecting book you&#x2019;ll want to share with all your friends, as you learn what Philpott has figured out along the way: that multiple things can be true of us at once&#x2014;and that sometimes doing things wrong is the way to do life right.</p><p>Mary Laura Philpott writes essays that examine the overlap of the absurd and the profound in everyday life. Her writing has been featured by <i>The New York Times</i>; <i>The Washington Post</i>;&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>; <i>McSweeney</i><i>&#x2019;</i><i>s</i>; <i>The Paris Review</i>; <i>O, The Oprah</i> <i>Magazine</i>; and other publications.

Mary Laura lives in Nashville with her family.I Miss You When I Blink I Miss You When I Blink<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s the perfect sentence, but I didn&#x2019;t write it. My six-year-old did.<br> <br>I was sitting at the desk in my home office, on a copywriting deadline for a client in the luggage industry, wrestling with a paragraph about suitcases. I leaned forward, as if putting my face closer to the computer could help the words on the screen make garment bags sound exciting. My little boy lay on his belly on the rug, &#x201c;working&#x201d; to pass the time until our promised walk to the park. He murmured to himself as he scribbled with a yellow pencil stub on one of my notepads.<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I miss you when I blink&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>It stopped me mid-thought. &#x201c;Say that again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I miss you when I blink,&#x201d; he answered, and looked up, pleased to have caught my attention. He turned back to his notepad, chattering on with his rhyme (I miss you in the sink&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I miss you in a skating rink&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.). When he ripped off the page and tossed it aside, I picked it up and pinned it to the bulletin board on my office wall.<br> <br>I turned those words over in my mind while I folded laundry that afternoon. I thought about them while I brushed my teeth that evening. I repeated them to myself as I lay awake in bed. I said them out loud as I sat in traffic the next day. I miss you when I blink. I thought, How cute.<br> <br>Over the next several months, I saw the note on the wall every time I walked into my office, and the phrase lodged itself in my head like a song lyric. I played with the words when I had writer&#x2019;s block, tossing them about like a squishy stress ball. It would make a great title for a sappy love poem, I thought, one where the poet can&#x2019;t stand to lose sight of his lover even for a split second. Or an album of goodbye songs, dedicated to a time or place that&#x2019;s disappeared. Maybe a country ballad about a lost hound dog. The one that got away. Anyone could be the &#x201c;you.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a few years later when it occurred to me: You could even say it to yourself.<br> <br>We all keep certain phrases handy in our minds&#x2014;hanging on hooks just inside the door where we can grab them like a raincoat, for easy access. Not mantras exactly, but go-to choruses that state how things are, that give structure to the chaos and help life make a little more sense.<br> <br>A friend of mine uses &#x201c;not my circus, not my monkeys&#x201d; a lot. It helps her ignore her instinct to get involved in things that aren&#x2019;t her business, and it also makes her remember that people have all sorts of reasons for the things they do, many of which she&#x2019;ll never understand. It&#x2019;s useful for both behavior modification and acceptance.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s getting out of here alive&#x201d; is one of mine. I find it motivational and comforting. I say it to myself when I&#x2019;m marching along on the elliptical machine, because it reminds me that there absolutely will come an end to my time on earth, and if I want to push it off as far into the distance as I can, I need to get my heart strong and work off the sugar I consume every day. I say it to myself when I&#x2019;m trying to calm down and deal with a jerk, because it helps me put things in perspective. We&#x2019;re all going to die, and would I really die with more points if I took this person down, or should I have some empathy and grace and let our differences go?<br> <br>Over time, &#x201c;I miss you when I blink&#x201d; became another one of these phrases. It helps me live in the moment. It slows me down and makes me absorb each instant instead of rushing, because I know already how much I miss things that happened in the past&#x2014;how they&#x2019;re right there behind my eyelids but also gone forever. When my now-teenage son is doing something very teenage son and I&#x2019;m having to ask him for the eighth time in one evening to pick up his inside-out pants from the bathroom floor, &#x201c;I miss you when I blink&#x201d; helps me be more patient. He was six just a second ago. He&#x2019;ll grow up and leave me in another second. &#x201c;I miss you when I blink.&#x201d; It captures the depths of my love. Could he have meant all this when he was little and scribbling, or was he just trying to rhyme with &#x201c;sink&#x201d;?<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no way he could have known.<br> <br>So he also couldn&#x2019;t have realized how perfectly &#x201c;I miss you when I blink&#x201d; captures that universal adult experience: the identity crisis. But there it is.<br> <br>The old stereotypical identity crisis happens in midlife, to a man, and it features a twenty-five-year-old dental hygienist and a pricey sports car with an engine that sounds like a helicopter. The new stereotypical identity crisis happens to a woman, often when she&#x2019;s turning forty, and it involves either a lengthy stay in Tuscany (ideally in a picturesque cottage) or a very long hike (maybe the trail to Machu Picchu? preferably with a large backpack). But the &#x201c;I miss you when I blink&#x201d; kind of identity crisis, that&#x2019;s something else. Something under the radar, much more common.<br> <br>For so many people I know, there is no one big midlife smashup; there&#x2019;s a recurring sense of having met an impasse, a need to turn around and not only change course, but change the way you are. It can happen anytime and many times. As we leave school and enter the real world, as we move in and out of friendships and romances, as we reckon with professional choices and future plans, and sure, when we hit midlife, but earlier and later, too.<br> <br>I think this repeated need for recalibration happens partly because so many ways of being are pitched to us&#x2014;particularly to women&#x2014;as either-or choices: You can have a career or a family; be a domestic goddess who cans her own strawberry jam or a train wreck who flaunts the wine in her coffee mug; wear a blazer and tote a bullet journal or stick pencils in your messy bun and wipe paint on your jeans. Pious or profane. One thing or the other. Even whether or not you buy into those dichotomies seems to be an either-or proposition: You believe in &#x201c;having it all&#x201d; or you believe &#x201c;having it all&#x201d; is outdated bunk. Pick a way.<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s true that at any given second, a person is doing one thing or another. I can swallow a bite of toast right now or I can whistle the theme song from House of Cards. I can&#x2019;t do both at the exact same moment or I&#x2019;ll choke. But our lives aren&#x2019;t one suspended moment, a single either-or choice; they&#x2019;re a string of moments, a string of choices. Going from one moment to the next is not always a comfortable process. Sometimes it hurts, like when you realize your child no longer needs you to be his daily sidekick, and you have to adjust to a new role in his life. Sometimes it&#x2019;s a comedy of errors, like when you decide you&#x2019;re ready for a fresh start and you buy a whole wardrobe of pants and blouses that seem sleek and smart in the dressing room but in the light of day make you look like you&#x2019;re about to give a PowerPoint presentation on a golf course. Sometimes you know one phase of life is ending&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve outgrown a relationship or reached the end of a long project&#x2014;but you don&#x2019;t know what the next step is supposed to be. You feel sure you can&#x2019;t go forward and you can&#x2019;t go back and you absolutely, positively cannot stand still one minute longer, all of which is insanely frustrating.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what small identity shifts look like in everyday lives. Not the stereotypes.<br> <br>The kind of crucial points in life I&#x2019;m talking about are the ones that often go unseen, that most of us would feel embarrassed to call crises. They&#x2019;re the ones a friend might talk about while sitting on your front steps in the dark at midnight after a dinner party, stalling because she doesn&#x2019;t want to go home. Or because she hates her job. Or she&#x2019;s scared something&#x2019;s wrong with her kid or her spouse. Or she just saw one of her notebooks from college in a drawer, and she feels so detached from the person who wrote those brilliant notes about Virginia Woolf, and she&#x2019;s worried that smart twenty-year-old has disappeared and she&#x2019;ll never get her back, but she thinks she might want to try. She misses herself when she blinks.<br> <br>I miss you when I blink. I have felt it so many times in my life, at points where I didn&#x2019;t really know who I was anymore, where I felt that when I closed my eyes, I could feel myself gone.<br> <br>I still have that scrap of paper my son wrote on all those years ago, before I had any clue that what he was writing would become my touchstone. I didn&#x2019;t know then what a versatile refrain it would become.<br> <br>I use it all the time. When I feel pressure to do the one exactly right thing&#x2014;which I feel all the time because I am a human and a perfectionist&#x2014;I remember all the selves I simultaneously have been, am, and will be. I miss you when I blink means I know all my selves are here with me, and I know we can do this. Saying it to myself is like a coach pushing a player out onto the field and saying, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got it. Just do what we practiced.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s like a parent placing a hand on the shoulder of an almost-grown child heading out the door to the prom, saying, &#x201c;Remember who you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sometimes I think, Dammit, I will never be fifteen or twenty-five or thirty-five again. Those lives I&#x2019;ve lived are over. And I get a little wistful, thinking I might like to get some of that time back. But then I remember my twenty-one-year-old self sitting in my cubicle at my first job out of college, feeling utterly confused and wishing she could disappear, and I think, Hey, young-me, it gets better. I swear. Worse sometimes, but also better.<br> <br>And when I have anxiety attacks about the future&#x2014;What if right now is the happiest I will ever be and I&#x2019;m not appreciating it enough? Will I reach the end of my days having never lived in France or made enough people happy or learned everything there is to know about outer space or being able to do a split? Am I eating enough anti-oxidants? What will I be doing in ten years? In twenty?&#x2014;I say I miss you when I blink to myself, and it means, Get a grip. Don&#x2019;t panic. To figure out where to go next, look at where you came from. If you got here, you can get to the next thing.<br> <br>Sometimes, in moments of memory or daydream, I feel the different iterations of myself pass by each other, as if right-now-me crosses paths with past-me or imaginary-me or even future-me in the hallways of my mind. &#x201c;I miss you when I blink,&#x201d; one says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right here,&#x201d; says the other, and reaches out a hand.<br> <br></p><h2>Second Chance Girl: A Modern Fairy Tale Romance (Happily Inc, 2)</h2><p><strong>A touching modern fairy tale that won&#x2019;t let go of your heart, from the #1 </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author of the Fool&#x2019;s Gold romances!</strong><br><br>Mathias Mitchell&#x2019;s easy smile hides a world of hurt.

Yes, we all need a good-sized nest egg once we leave work, but when it comes to time and retirement, most people give almost no thought to what an average day might look like. One reason, of course, is that retirement seems . . . easy, welcoming. (What can be so tough about not working?) There&#x2019;s also the assumption that leisure activities will be just as fulfilling, if not more so, than work&#x2014;a dangerous assumption for people who have enjoyed their careers. It&#x2019;s not that people can&#x2019;t see themselves in retirement. If you ask almost anyone what he or she plans to do in his or her sixties and beyond, the answers invariably involve some mix of travel, play and work.<br><br> Specifics, though, are few and far between. As it turns out, vague answers to the question, &#x201c;What will I do for twenty or thirty years?&#x201d; can be just as debilitating as vague financial goals.<br>The best way to begin shaping your life in retirement is to look upon retiring itself as a process, not an event. With a dream, some planning and a bit of luck, your retirement might resemble that of Pam and Larry Satek.<br>Pam had recently retired as principal of a Chicago-area&nbsp;elementary school, and Larry was a few months away from retiring from his job as a research chemist. The couple&#x2014;both in their late fifties at the time&#x2014;had opened a winery in Fremont, a small town in the northeast corner of Indiana.<br>In the early 1990s, about ten years before the couple planned to retire, they began talking about what their future might look like. Rest and relaxation didn&#x2019;t hold much appeal. &#x201c;Neither one of us is a sit-down-and-do-nothing type of person,&#x201d; Larry told us. A shared interest in wines seemed to hold some promise, but how could they turn that interest into a second career? To find the answer, the Sateks started educating themselves about the wine business. They took courses at Purdue University. They compiled articles and books. They collared experts and asked questions. (What varieties of grapes are best suited to Indiana&#x2019;s soil and climate? What makes a good site for a winery?) They even planted a small vineyard on a patch of family property and sold the grapes to existing wineries in the area.<br>Gradually, over the course of several years, a dream took shape: The Sateks would attempt to build and operate their own winery in retirement.<br>In June 2001, Pam and Larry opened the doors of Satek Winery. The first day, some 500 customers walked through the entrance. &#x201c;It was just the two of us in the tasting room,&#x201d; Pam recalled, &#x201c;and neither one of us had ever worked a cash register. It was nerve-wracking.&#x201d; In all, there were just three employees, including the Sateks. Production that first year totaled 1,000 cases. By the time the fifth anniversary rolled around, the winery employed fifteen people and was producing about 6,000 cases of wine annually. (You can read about the very real fruits of the Sateks&#x2019; labors at www.satekwinery.com.)<br>Looking back to when he and Pam began talking about their hopes for retirement, Larry Satek recalled that the important thing was simply to set out. &#x201c;We told ourselves, &#x2018;If we don&#x2019;t start doing this, it will always be a dream.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>If the Sateks&#x2019; story sounds encouraging, consider that your retirement&#x2014;at least initially&#x2014;is more likely to resemble that of Terry Culp.<br>Terry was just fifty-two years old when he received an offer he couldn&#x2019;t refuse to sell his five manufacturing businesses in Buffalo, New York. He and his wife climbed into their sport-utility vehicle and moved to an exclusive retirement community in Las Vegas, where he proceeded to golf himself silly. Eighteen months later, he was frustrated and bored.<br>&#x201c;There was too much missing&#x2014;including a sense of me,&#x201d; Terry told us. &#x201c;A huge piece of my life was totally gone. I realized that going cold turkey [from work] . . . was having a much bigger psychological impact on me than I had ever imagined.&#x201d;<br>His decision &#x201c;was totally impromptu.&#x201d; &#x201c;We had a great opportunity to sell the companies, it made good business sense, and we simply said, &#x2018;Maybe it&#x2019;s time to try retirement.&#x2019; I spent absolutely no time really planning for it.&#x201d;<br>Terry eventually returned to full-time work, joining&#x2014;much to his delight&#x2014;a program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, that provides technical assistance to small manufacturing, mining and construction businesses. Looking back, however, he offered a blunt assessment of how he jumped into retirement: &#x201c;I give myself a &#x2018;D&#x2019;&#x2014;at best.&#x201d;<br>We&#x2019;ve found that the retirees who are most satisfied with their lives are the ones who thought and talked about their hopes for the future&#x2014;typically, several years before retirement itself&#x2014;and then took specific actions to move closer to those goals. The Sateks are a good example. One of the most important steps Pam and Larry took was simply to begin talking about retirement&#x2014;what it might look like and how they might want to spend their time. &#x201c;We took it very seriously,&#x201d; Larry told us. &#x201c;And it paid off.&#x201d;<br>Others, like Alice Ahlers, take a more organic approach, remaining open to new interests (whether before or after retirement itself) that, in turn, open doors to a more meaningful life. In 1996, Alice retired from the Department of Labor and signed up to take several trips with Elderhostel, the Boston-based educational program for older learners. One trip took her to Peru, another on a barge down the Seine River through France. Wherever she went, she told us, she found herself drawn to the area&#x2019;s folk art. Eventually, the experiences led to a new passion: &#x201c;I wanted to be able to make beautiful things and have the skill to do it.&#x201d;<br>To that end, Alice took fifty-three courses&#x2014;some a week long, some on weekends&#x2014;at the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina, in a wide range of crafts. (She told us that she was financing her education, as well as additional trips, by keeping the books for her son&#x2019;s antiques business.) At the time we spoke, she was drawing plans to turn her backyard patio into a home studio so she and her friends from the craft school, who often travel across several states to visit, would have more space for creating artwork together.<br>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS<br>Ronald Manheimer, executive director of the Center for Creative Retirement at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, has distilled seven questions you should consider before retiring:<br><br>1. What Is My Image of Retirement? And Is It Useful and Accurate?<br>Start with the basics by taking an inventory of your interests&#x2014;those activities or hobbies that already occupy some of your time&#x2014;and ask, Which of these deserve more of your time? If you value reading and education, perhaps you see yourself&nbsp;attending classes at a local college in retirement or volunteering in a reading program at an inner-city school. Do you enjoy the outdoors? The open road? If so, maybe you see yourself buying a recreational vehicle in retirement or becoming a search-and-rescue volunteer. Do you like to collect things? Perhaps retirement might involve opening an antiques shop. The first step is figuring out whether your interests will translate into daily activities. Whether the activities are doable and fulfilling is the second step.<br>We listened to the story of one man who had dabbled in art when he was younger and decided that retirement would be the time when he could indulge this passion. But in his first art class in retirement, he found the work to be much harder and more time-consuming than he had imagined, and he came to the realization that art wasn&#x2019;t his calling. The discovery was something of a shock; this person had assumed that art would fill his days.<br>The point is to do some &#x201c;field-testing&#x201d; of your retirement plans before you retire. If you think you want to pursue a career in art, wonderful. But take a few art classes while you&#x2019;re still working to see if the idea makes sense. If not, you can start exploring other interests.<br>2. When Is It Time to Leave My Job, and Do I Want to Return to Paid Employment, Possibly in a Second or Third Career?<br>Often, people leave work when they reach a certain age, when their nest egg reaches some pre-determined size, or when they take advantage of a buyout. None of that is necessarily unwise. But if you leave work primarily because your bank account, or the calendar, tells you it&#x2019;s time, you could be using the wrong yardsticks.<br>Early retirement can be especially tricky. That&#x2019;s because busy careers don&#x2019;t offer much time to develop a vision for retirement.<br>John Wilson, an insurance executive, was fifty years old when he took early retirement. Faced with a move from his home in the Midwest to company headquarters in New York City and not wishing to uproot his family, he decided to retire. All too quickly, he told us, that decision proved flawed.<br>First came the shock of trying to figure out &#x201c;what I was going to do for the ten hours between when I got up and when I had dinner with my family,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am not a mint-juleps-on-the-porch kind of guy.&#x201d; Then came the regrets. &#x201c;[This] may sound like a stupid answer, but when people ask me what I miss the most, it&#x2019;s the stress of my old job,&#x201d; he told us. &#x201c;When you have seventy people working for you and they&#x2019;re pulling at you all day long, and you&#x2019;re scrambling to meet deadlines, you think: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m in charge; I can handle this.&#x2019; Suddenly, nobody&#x2019;s hanging at your door anymore. And the only stress you have is the stress of being retired.&#x201d;<br>Compare John&#x2019;s experience with that of Irv Laddin, who took an early buyout from International Business Machines Corp. The difference is that three years before the buyout offer, Irv and his wife opened a small travel business&#x2014;specifically as part of their plans for retirement. &#x201c;I always had in the back of my mind the idea that I would like to be the captain of a ship, as opposed to the crew or first officer or whatever,&#x201d; Irv told us. &#x201c;A lot of my friends had left IBM and started their own businesses and had done very well.<br>&#x201c;As it turned out, the timing worked great. About three years [after the travel agency was started], IBM came up with an outstanding program for early retirement for certain people, and I was able&#x2014;because we had the business&#x2014;to look at it much more positively as an opportunity. Quite possibly, I would not have taken the early out had we not had the business, too. In fact, it was very much a going business at that point.&#x201d;<br>3. How Do I Balance My Dreams and Goals with My Family and Societal Responsibilities?<br>People often look at retirement in isolation. They don&#x2019;t discuss their plans with other family members, including their adult children&#x2014;and sometimes their spouses. And that can be a big mistake.<br>After Rosemary Ford retired as an attorney for the state of Massachusetts, she simply assumed that her husband would follow suit when he first became eligible for retirement benefits. As it turned out, Dick Ford, also a lawyer, kept right on working.<br>&#x201c;She thought [my retirement] was a given, and I kind of thought it was a given, too,&#x201d; Dick told us. &#x201c;But the fact of the matter is, when that [date] approached, Rosemary and I hadn&#x2019;t done any really hard discussion or planning [about retirement].&#x201d; All of which meant that Rosemary Ford was left waiting to begin the rest of her life.<br>&#x201c;I really had this vision that we&#x2019;d just go and kind of travel wildly for a couple of years,&#x201d; she told us. &#x201c;But it didn&#x2019;t work out that way.&#x201d;<br>If you&#x2019;re like many people approaching retirement, you probably have thought about doing some volunteer work. A recent survey by Civic Ventures, a San Francisco-based think tank, found that three out of five people in their fifties want to use the next stage of their lives to improve the quality of life in their communities. (We talk about volunteering in detail in Chapter Three.) Many retirees and would-be retirees are not only giving back to their communities, but going several steps further: identifying needs, forming organizations to meet those needs, raising money and creating (in effect) small businesses that can support and perpetuate themselves. The job title is &#x201c;social entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br>After opening and running her own antiques store in Richmond, Virginia, for thirty years, Martha Franck Rollins turned over the reins to her husband and started Boaz and Ruth, a nonprofit group that helps rehabilitate former prison inmates. Today, the organization&#x2019;s side businesses include furniture restoration, a caf�, catering, home repair and moving&#x2014;ventures that provide training and jobs and help revitalize surrounding neighborhoods. Martha told us that she began by asking herself a question: &#x201c;I thought, how can God use an antiques dealer?&#x201d;<br>4. Can the Next Step in My Life Be&nbsp;Truly Revitalizing?<br>For some, retirement is an opportunity for a new beginning, a chance to transform one&#x2019;s life. It&#x2019;s worth taking time, then, to consider just how evolutionary&#x2014;or revolutionary&#x2014;you wish your retirement to be. Perhaps life after collecting a gold watch resembles life before the watch: still playing golf, still working with Habitat for Humanity or still visiting with the grandkids. And that&#x2019;s the way you prefer it. Or perhaps you end up reinventing yourself.<br>John Berkenfield, a thirty-year veteran of IBM, retired on a July afternoon. Thirty days later, he started work as the director of a small museum south of Santa Fe, New Mexico. There had been no specific plans for retirement until a friend, by chance, read a newspaper ad about an opening at the museum. John knew a lot about business and marketing, but nothing about running a museum. Still, he applied for, and got, the job. (The competition thinned considerably, he recalled, when aspirants learned about the pay and benefits&#x2014;or virtual lack thereof.) During his watch, annual attendance rose to about 53,000 visitors from 15,000, and volunteers contributed more than 27,000 hours of their time compared with about 1,000 hours before his arrival.<br>&#x201c;Spend your time [in retirement] learning and doing something very different from what you&#x2019;ve done in your past life,&#x201d; John advises. You have a better chance of remaining &#x201c;intellectually stimulated&#x201d; if you do so, he said.<br>5. How Will I Structure My Time?<br>For some people, the free time that comes with retirement produces anxiety about how to fill their days; thus, they take on too many responsibilities&#x2014;volunteer work, school, a part-time job, etc. They become busier in retirement than when they were working.<br>As Ellen Graham, an award-winning reporter for The Wall Street Journal, put it: &#x201c;I remember thinking about what I might enjoy in retirement: mentoring a child, perhaps, or acting in a little theater or returning to painting. Now, my days seem to evaporate in a haze of club activities and volunteer chores, most of which I wandered into by accident.&#x201d;</p><h2>Half Slave and Half Free, Revised Edition: The Roots of Civil War</h2><p><p>Revised Edition<br>With a New Preface and Afterword</p><p>In a revised edition, brought completely up to date with a new preface and afterword and an expanded bibliography, Bruce Levine's succinct and persuasive treatment of the basic issues that precipitated the Civil War is as compelling as ever. Levine explores the far-reaching, divisive changes in American life that came with the incomplete Revolution of 1776 and the development of two distinct social systems, one based on slavery, the other on free labor--changes out of which the Civil War developed.</p></p><p><p><b>Bruce Levine</b>, James G. Randall Professor of History at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is a co-author of <i>Who Built America</i>? and the author of <i>The Spirit of 1848: German Immigrants, Labor Conflict, and the Coming of Civil War </i>and <i>Confederate Emancipation: Southern Plans to Free Slaves during the Civil War</i>.</p>A concise and clear treatment of the diverse issues and social changes that precipitated the Civil War. Working largely with the results of recent scholarship on the antebellum period, Levine (American History/Univ. of Cincinnati; ed., Who Built America?, 1990) argues that the American Revolution occurred in two distinct stages. The first, liberation from Britain, came about only through a fragile alliance between separate social orders, one based on servile labor and the other on free labor--but the compromises between these systems (an integral part of the fabric of the Constitution), Levine tells us, failed to hold up as America expanded westward. The Civil War was the second stage, the result of friction that grew increasingly heated as other factors came into play. Changes in work life and cultural life in the North and South, Levine says, led to clearer class distinctions, sharpening the perceptions of laborers who toiled as free men and as slaves. Assessing the contribution to the debate from free blacks in both regions, from abolitionists and proslavery rabble-rousers, and especially from the hard-working German and Irish immigrants who had little use for plantation society, Levine sees the polarization in attitudes manifesting in specific political platforms, most notably in the rise of Republicanism in the 1850's as Whigs, Democrats, Know-Nothings, and other parties proved unequal to the task of curbing slavery. Intelligent, eminently readable sociopolitical history. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The men on the ground after the bloody deed took an oath that they would never mention the event again, either in public or in private. The leaders of the Mormon church also counseled silence. The first report, soon after the massacre, described it as an Indian onslaught at which a few white men were present, only one of whom, John D. Lee, was actually named.</p><p>With admirable scholarship, Mrs. Brooks has traced the background of conflict, analyzed the emotional climate at the time, pointed up the social and military organization in Utah, and revealed the forces which culminated in the great tragedy at Mountain Meadows. The result is a near-classic treatment which neither smears nor clears the participants as individuals. It portrays an atmosphere of war hysteria, whipped up by recitals of past persecutions and the vision of an approaching "army" coming to drive the Mormons from their homes.</p></p><p><p><strong>Juanita Brooks</strong> held appointment as a field fellow of the Henry E.

No one captures the small town subtleties - the quirks and the quiet dignity - with as much warmth as Jon Hassler. My friend eventually moved to Minneapolis and has seen the author about a dozen times. I don't think she moved to Minnesota just to stalk Mr. Hassler, but it is a nice plus for her. Working in the office, I've read his books before they've been published and seen the comments from his editor and his letters as the manuscript become a final novel. I've never actually spoken to him though which, in a way, I like. You see, I love all of his books but when I think of Jon Hassler, I picture the warm, quiet, intelligent gentleman and slightly awkward and anxious observer- that is Miles Pruitt, the hero of Staggerford. I'm sure it's not accurate - what author is just like his protagonist? - but I like thinking of him just like that.<br>-S.

Unfortunately, as Terry Bouton shows in this highly provocative first book, the Revolutionary elite often seemed as determined to squash democracy after the war as they were to support it before.<br><br>Centering on Pennsylvania, the symbolic and logistical center of the Revolution, Bouton shows how this radical shift in ideology spelled tragedy for hundreds of common people. Leading up to the Revolution, Pennsylvanians were united in their opinion that "the people" (i.e. white men) should be given access to the political system, and that some degree of wealth equality (i.e. among white men) was required to ensure that political freedom prevailed. As the war ended, Pennsylvania's elites began brushing aside these ideas, using their political power to pass laws to enrich their own estates and hinder political organization by their opponents. By the 1780s, they had reenacted many of the same laws that they had gone to war to abolish, returning Pennsylvania to a state of economic depression and political hegemony. This unhappy situation led directly to the Whiskey and Fries rebellions, popular uprisings both put down by federal armies.<br><br>Bouton's work reveals a unique perspective, showing intimately how the war and the events that followed affected poor farmers and working people. Bouton introduces us to unsung heroes from this time--farmers, weavers, and tailors who put their lives on hold to fight to save democracy from the forces of "united avarice." We also get a starkly new look at some familiar characters from the Revolution, including Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington, who Bouton strives to make readers see as real, flawed people, blinded by their own sense of entitlement.<br><br><em>Taming Democracy</em> represents a turning point in how we view the outcomes of the Revolutionary War and the motivations of the powerful men who led it. Its eye-opening revelations and insights make it an essential read for all readers with a passion for uncovering the true history of America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terry Bouton</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.<br><br>"The overall story is convincing, not least because Bouton strikes an admirable balance between quantitative and qualitative evidence...Bouton writes with quiet passion, laying out evidence in careful sequence, creating sympathy for ordinary people without romanticizing them...<em>Taming Democracy</em> brings social conflict and economic analysis back to the center of Revolutionary historiography."--J.M. Opal, <em>Interdisciplinary History</em><p></p><br>"Button has written an important and good book. He skillfully combines discussions of social history, finance, and political economy to show just how catastrophic the 1780s were for most Americans. <em>Taming Democracy</em> is, to date, the best introduction to the worldview of small property holders during the postrevolutionary period."--Andrew Shankman, <em>William and Mary Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Bouton clarifies murky economic concepts in a lively fashion and, above all, projects the reader's mind into the lives of ordinary citizens who felt betrayed and frustrated by leaders they themselves had set up and followed faithfully through the dark years of the Revolution."--T.S. Martin, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"This is a rare book--scholarly yet written with verve, readable for pleasure as well as for knowledge."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"With keen insight and deep research, Terry Bouton recovers a lost world: the agrarian democracy of revolutionary America.

By retelling their story so fully and fairly, Bouton renews their cause in our present day."--Alan Taylor, author of <em>The Divided Ground</em><p></p><br>"In thoughtful, readable prose Terry Bouton shows us what the American Revolution meant for one group who counted: the small-scale farmers of Pennsylvania. They struggled; they thought; they fought. Ultimately they lost what they believed what they had won, a world that would be good for them and their families. The Revolution belonged to Bouton's kind of people, ordinary Americans living through an extraordinary time, as much as it did to the Founding Fathers."--Edward Countryman, author of <em>The American Revolution</em><p></p><br>"For many ordinary Americans living in Pennsylvania, the Revolution did not turn out as they had hoped. Committed to the creation of a more egalitarian society, they resisted British rule, only to discover that the rich and well-born had no interest in supporting serious democratic reform. In this compelling study, Bouton brings passion and insight to the bittersweet story of the betrayal of a truly revolutionary society."--T.H. Breen, Director, Center for Historical Studies, Northwestern University<p></p><br>"The 'whiskey rebellion' clearly has been misnamed: Bouton argues convincingly that it grew out of two decades of struggles by Pennsylvania's farmers with 'moneyed men' for the fruits of the Revolution. He tells their story in gripping scenes of the sheriff's wagon carting off the belongings of debtors and of farmers defiantly closing down roads. This is a book about the Revolution that breaks new ground."--Alfred Young, author of <em>Liberty Tree: Ordinary People and the American Revolution</em><p></p><br>"Prominent citizens like George Washington and Alexander Hamilton considered the American Revolution an unruly steed, and they devoted considerable energy to reining it in. Terry Bouton's superbly-written account of how they achieved that feat leaves us wishing they had failed. The focus of Bouton's startlingly-original book is nothing less than the struggle for the soul of America."--Woody Holton, University of Richmond<p></p><br>"<em>Taming Democracy</em> will have a major impact on early American historians and further the re-evaluation of the entire Revolutionary period. Bouton's book will revitalize the economic interpretation of the era."--Allan Kulikoff, University of Georgia<p></p><br></p><h2>A History of Japan to 1334</h2><p>This is a straightforward narrative of the development of Japanese civilization to 1334 by the author of <i>Japan: A Short Cultural History</i>. While complete in itself, it is also the first volume of a three-volume work which will be the first large-scale, comprehensive history of Japan. Taken as a whole, the projected history represents the culmination of the life work of perhaps the most distinguished historian now writing on Japan. Unlike the renowned <i>Short Cultural History</i>, it is concerned mainly with political and social phenomena and only incidentally touches on religion, literature, and the arts. The treatment is primarily descriptive and factual, but the author offers some pragmatic interpretations and suggests comparisons with the history of other peoples. <i>A History of Japan to 1334</i> describes the growth from tribal origins of an organized state on a Chinese model, gives a picture of the life of the Royal Court, and examines the conflict between a polished urban nobility and a warlike rural gentry. It traces the evolution of an efficient system of feudal government which deprived the sovereign of all but his ritual functions and the prestige of his ancestry. The structure of Japanese feudal society is depicted in some detail and explained in terms of its internal stresses and its behavior in peace and war, especially during the period of the Mongol attacks in the last decades of the thirteenth century. The volume ends with the collapse of the feudal government at Kamakura under the attack of ambitious rivals.</p><p>The author has attempted to eschew theoretical assumptions about human societies and confined himself to a straightforward narrative. He has made use of the work of leading Japanese historians, and consulted primary sources.Sir George Sansom was a British diplomat and historian of pre-modern Japan. He authored several books, including <i>Japan: A Short Cultural History</i>, <i>An Historical Grammar of Japanese</i>, <i>The Western World and Japan</i>, and <i>Japan in World History</i>.</p><h2>The Alchemist and Other Plays: Volpone, or The Fox; Epicene, or The Silent Woman; The Alchemist; Bartholomew Fair (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This edition brings together Jonson's four great comedies <em>Volpone</em>, <em>Epicene</em>, <em>The Alchemist</em>, and <em>Bartholomew Fair</em>. The texts of these plays have all been newly edited for this volume, and are presented with modernized spelling.

In other words, they focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#39;t discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable -- but the job is only half done!

Brandel Chair of New Testament Studies at North Park Theological Seminary.</p>Ephesians 1:1-2 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: 2Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Letters in the ancient world followed a set form. They began by identifying the writer and the readers or addressees. This was usually followed by a greeting and a prayer or wish for health (even in secular letters), then the body of the letter, and finally the closing, which contained any details about the sending of the letter and another greeting. An example of this form appears in Acts 15:23-29 (without the prayer). Christian writers adapted this set form to their purposes, &#39;christianizing&#39; it by changing or expanding the traditional elements. The author and recipients are not merely identified; they are also described by their relation to Christ. The greeting was also made specifically Christian. Instead of merely &#39;Paul to the Ephesians, greetings,&#39; Paul described himself as &#39;an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God&#39; and his readers as holy (NIV, &#39;saints&#39;) and &#39;faithful in Christ Jesus.&#39; And instead of using the standard word &#39;greeting&#39; [chairein], through a play on words Paul changed his greeting to read &#39;grace [charis] and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#39; An apostle of Christ. Paul&#39;s identification of himself as an apostle appointed by God is his customary way of beginning his letters. (Cf. the exact parallels in 2 Cor. 1:1; Col. 1:1; 2 Tim. 1:1.) Often Paul had to defend his legitimacy as an apostle, but here the tone is merely descriptive. The term apostle carried several connotations in the early church, all of which were true of Paul. It referred to someone who had seen the risen Christ (1 Cor. 9:1), to those sent out by the church with a missionary task, or more broadly to anyone who functioned as an agent or representative. This self-description emphasizes the authority with which Paul wrote. If he was an apostle because of the will of God, what he wrote must be seen as communication from God. The will of God is an important theme in Ephesians, appearing more frequently here than in any other letter. The concern is not about Christians finding the will of God; rather, the emphasis is on God&#39;s purpose with his actions for humanity. The point here is that Paul was an apostle because God wanted him to be. In Paul&#39;s letters, &#39;Christ&#39; (meaning &#39;the Anointed One&#39;) is often no longer a title as it was in a Jewish context. Particularly among Gentile Christians it became a name, linked with the name &#39;Jesus.&#39; But of the forty-six occurrences of the word &#39;Christ&#39; in Ephesians, twenty-three have the article in Greek, some of which may still point to the role of the Jewish Messiah in the salvation of the Gentiles (see 1:10; 2:13; 4:20). The Holy Ones. The identification of the recipients as &#39;saints&#39; (lit., &#39;the holy ones&#39;) is Paul&#39;s usual description of Christians. &#39;Saints&#39; is not a helpful translation, for this English word usually refers to extraordinarily pious people. Paul&#39;s first intent was not that these people lived especially holy lives-he described the Corinthian Christians the same way (1 Cor. 1:2), and yet he had no illusions about the sanctity of their lives. Rather, his primary concern was to emphasize that just as he had been appointed by God to be an apostle, they too had been separated to God (separation is the key idea in the word &#39;holy&#39;). Paul&#39;s addressees were holy because God had set them apart to be his people. The focus is entirely on God&#39;s action and the reference is to God&#39;s saving work.1 The recipients2 of this letter are also described as &#39;faithful in Christ Jesus&#39; (cf. Col. 1:2). &#39;Faithful&#39; can refer either to someone who has proven to be faithful or to someone who is a believer, someone who has faith. The latter seems the better choice here (cf. John 20:27; Acts 10:45; 16:1, 15; 2 Cor. 6:15). With the expression &#39;in Christ Jesus&#39; we encounter one of the most significant and difficult points in Paul&#39;s writings. Paul is not merely saying these people believed in Christ; rather, they were in Christ positionally. This concept of being in Christ is one of if not the most important parts of Paul&#39;s theology, for this is the center from which he understood and explained salvation. The thirteen Pauline letters use &#39;in Christ,&#39; &#39;in the Lord,&#39; &#39;in him,&#39; or some similar expression 164 times to express a variety of ideas. &#39;Christ&#39; is usually used in contexts talking about salvation and its benefits, whereas &#39;Lord&#39; is usually used to talk about Christian behavior and life. Sometimes these terms are used to convey what believers obtain in Christ (as 1:7: &#39;in him we have redemption&#39;), at other times &#39;in Christ&#39; describes what a person does (4:17: &#39;So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord&#39;), and at still other times the focus is directly on the fact that a Christian is a person who is in Christ. This language expresses the oneness and the identity that a believer shares with Christ. Paul&#39;s gospel is a gospel about union with Christ, and this is the meaning in 1:1. Ephesians focuses more on union with Christ and on being in Christ than any other letter (36 times).3 The greeting. The wording in this verse is paralleled exactly in seven other Pauline letters. &#39;Grace and peace&#39; are important themes throughout Ephesians: Both are key words that describe God&#39;s initial salvation, and both describe God&#39;s continuing work among his people. As we will see in 1:3-14, &#39;grace&#39; is one of the most important words in Paul&#39;s theology. Even though other writers use this greeting (1 Peter 1:2; 2 Peter 1:2; Rev. 1:4), no other writer comes close to placing as much emphasis on grace as Paul. Not by accident, he begins and ends every letter with &#39;grace,&#39; as if to emphasize that all of life is lived in the parameters of grace. Though not used as frequently, &#39;peace&#39; too has a foundational role in Paul&#39;s theology. God alone is the one who conveys grace and peace, and Paul wants his readers to experience this.</p><h2>The Sacrifice (Abram&#39;s Daughters #3)</h2><p>Beautifully Repackaged: <br><i>The Betrayal</i> and <i>The Sacrifice<br></i><br>In <i>The Betrayal</i>, Leah Ebersol and her beloved Jonas Mast are separated by hundreds of miles when he accepts an apprenticeship in Ohio.

Why did the Soviets threaten to use poison gas against the Germans? Why did Hitler in 1945 insist that holding Prague could win the war for the Third Reich? Why did US General George Patton&#39;s Third Army race for the Skoda works at Pilsen in Czechoslovakia instead of Berlin? Why did the US Army not test the uranium atom bomb it dropped on Hiroshima? Why did the Luftwaffe fly a non-stop round trip mission to within twenty miles of New York City in 1944? This book takes the reader on a scientific-historical journey in order to answer these questions. Arguing that Nazi Germany actually won the race for the atom bomb in late 1944, the book then goes on to explore the even more secretive research the Nazis were conducting into the occult, alternative physics and new energy sources. The book concludes with a fresh look at the Nazi Legend of the UFO mystery by examining the Roswell Majestic-12 documents and the Kecksburg crash in the light of parallels with some of the super-secret black projects being run by the SS.

As pioneering settlers, they built a house of grass, ate off a damask cloth spread over packing cases, and discovered&#x2014;the hard way&#x2014;the world of the African. With an extraordinary gift for detail and a keen sense of humor, Huxley recalls her childhood on the small farm at a time when Europeans waged their fortunes on a land that was as harsh as it was beautiful. For a young girl, it was a time of adventure and freedom, and Huxley paints an unforgettable portrait of growing up among the Masai and Kikuyu people, discovering both the beauty and the terrors of the jungle, and enduring the rugged realities of the pioneer life.</p><p><b>Elspeth Huxley</b> was born in 1907 and spent most of her childhood in Kenya. She wrote novels, detective fiction, biographies, and travel books. She died in 1997.In 1913, at the age of six, Elspeth Huxley accompanied her parents from England to their recently acquired land in Kenya, "a bit of El Dorado my father had been fortunate enough to buy in the bar of the Norfolk hotel from a man wearing an Old Etonian tie." The land is not nearly what its seller claimed, but Elspeth's parents are undaunted and begin their coffee plantation. Her mother, a resourceful, adventurous woman, "eager always to extract from every moment its last drop of interest or pleasure," keeps an eye on Elspeth's education but also allows her extensive freedom. Through Elspeth Huxley's marvelous gift for description, early twentieth-century Kenya comes alive with all the excitement and naive insight of a child who watches with eyes wide open as coffee trees are planted, buffaloes are skinned, pythons are disemboweled, and cultures collide with all the grace of runaway trains. With a free-wheeling imagination and a dry wit, she describes the interactions of Kikuyus, Masais, Dutch Boers, Brits and Scots, mixing rapid-fire descriptions with philosophical musings. It is a mixture that suits her land of contrasts and unknowns, where vastly different peoples live and work side by side but rarely come together, like an egg beater whose "the two arms whirled independently and never touched, so that perhaps one arm never knew the other was there; yet they were together, turned by the same handle, and the cake was mixed by both." <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>The Christian in Complete Armour (2 Volumes)</h2><p>Gurnall's <i>Christian in Complete Armour</i>, certainly one of the greatest of all the Puritan's practical writings, has been many times republished, but the best edition remains that of 1864, with an Introduction by J.C. Ryle. It is this unabridged edition which is now reprinted. <br> This <i>Complete Armour</i> is beyond all others a preacher's book: I should think that more discourses have been suggested by it than by any other uninspired volume. I have often resorted to it when my own fire has been burning low, and I have seldom failed to find a glowing coal upon Gurnall s hearth. John Newton said that if he might read only one book beside the Bible, he would choose <i>The Christian in Complete Armour</i>, and Richard Cecil was of much the same opinion.</p><p>William Gurnall (1616-1679) was born in the coastal town of Lynn, Norfolk, about a hundred miles north of London. His father was first an alderman (town council member), then mayor of Lynn, a chief town of the most thoroughly Protestant district of England in the seventeenth century. The inhabitants of Norfolk and Suffolk counties were famous for their deep attachment to the doctrines of the Reformation. <br> An excellent scholar, Gurnall was awarded a scholarship from the city of Lynn to attend Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He began his formal training there in his 16th year, shortly after his father's death. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1635 and a master s degree in 1639.<br> At the age of 28, William Gurnall was appointed curate and then rector on the death of the incumbent of the church at Lavenham, Suffolk, then a town of about 1,800 inhabitants, half of whom were his parishioners. A year later he married a minister's daughter, Sarah Mott, who bore him at least fourteen children, eight of whom survived him. Gurnall spent the rest of his life, dogged by ill-health, in this pastorate. <br> The years during which Gurnall served the parish at Lavenham were filled with momentous events in English history: a civil war, the beheading of King Charles I, the declaring of a protectorate under Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell, then the death of Cromwell, and the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II. But the most significant event for Gurnall was the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662. He chose to remain in the Church, signed the declaration required by the Act, and was ordained a priest by the evangelical Bishop Reynolds of Norwich. His reputation amongst the Puritans consequently suffered and is probably the reason so little has been written about William Gurnall in the annals of church history.<br> It was during this time of civil and religious strife and controversy that Gurnall preached to his parishioners his messages on spiritual warfare. With the help of a benefactor, Gurnall published his material in three volumes between 1655 and 1662 The Christian in Complete Armour. He dedicated the first volume to the inhabitants of Lavenham.<br>Gurnall died on October 12, 1679, in the 63rd year of his life. The fact that a sixth edition of his work was published in the year he died is enough to show that its merits were early recognized.'If I might read only one book beside the Bible, I would choose <i>The Christian in Complete Armour</i>.' --<strong><i>John Newton</i></strong><br><br>'Gurnall's work is peerless and priceless; every line is full of wisdom; every sentence is suggestive. I have often resorted to it when my own fire has been burning low, and I have seldom failed to find a glowing coal upon Gurnall's hearth.' --<strong><i>Charles H. Spurgeon</i></strong><br><br>'A beautiful feature in Gurnall's book is its richness in pithy, pointed, and epigrammatical sayings. You will often find in a line and a half some great truth, put so concisely, and yet so fully, that you really marvel how so much thought could be got into so few words. Solid scriptural theology, like that contained in these pages, should be valued and studied in the church. Books in which Scripture is reverently regarded as the only rule of faith and practice books in which Christ and the Holy Ghost have their rightful office books in which justification, and sanctification, and regeneration, and faith, and grace, and holiness are clearly, distinctly, and accurately delineated and exhibited these are the only books which do real good. Few things need reviving more than a taste for such books as these among readers.' <br><strong><i>--J.C.

In <i>Refusing Heaven</i>, Gilbert writes compellingly about the commingled passion, loneliness, and sometimes surprising happiness of a life spent in luminous understanding of his own blessings and shortcomings: &#x201c;The days and nights wasted . . . Long hot afternoons / watching ants while the cicadas railed / in the Chinese elm about the brevity of life.&#x201d; Time slows down in these poems, as Gilbert creates an aura of curiosity and wonder at the fact of existence itself. Despite powerful intermittent griefs&#x2013;over the women he has parted from or the one lost to cancer (an experience he captures with intimate precision)&#x2013;Gilbert&#x2019;s choice in this volume is to &#x201c;refuse heaven.&#x201d; He prefers this life, with its struggle and alienation and delight, to any paradise. His work is both a rebellious assertion of the call to clarity and a profound affirmation of the world in all its aspects. It braces the reader in its humanity and heart.</p><p>Jack Gilbert was born in Pittsburgh. He is the author of <i>The Great Fires: Poems 1982&#x2014;1992</i>; <i>Monolithos</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; and <i>Views of Jeopardy</i>, the 1962 winner of the Yale Younger Poets Prize.

We know they prevent a host of modern degenerative diseases, including cancer and heart disease. Although the United States Cancer Institute recommends that you eat five servings of fresh vegetables and three servings of fresh fruit each day, and Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating suggests five to ten servings of fresh fruit and vegetables, research shows that significant numbers of people are not meeting these dietary objectives. One of the easiest ways to eat your fruits and vegetables is to drink them. And every year, more and more people are doing just that: according to the California-based Juice and Smoothie Association, by July 2002 the juice and smoothie business topped $1 billion in sales. Fast and easy to make, smoothies are also becoming the beverage of choice at home, where you can choose the ingredients you use, ensuring their freshness and quality. </p><p> Children are probably the biggest fans -- and beneficiaries -- of smoothies, which deliver phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals that are so essential for growing bodies. By nine or ten years of age, children are capable of learning the basics of operating a blender safely and cleaning it when they are finished. Teaching them how to make their own satisfying and nutritious drinks will build a healthy habit that will last a lifetime. </p><p> People at every point in the life cycle, from singles to empty nesters to the elderly, are discovering the simplicity and nutritional benefits of smoothies. Because they are so quick and easy to make and require minimal cleanup, smoothies are ideal to make in small quantities that suit one or two people. They are also a delicious medium in which to take herbal or pharmaceutical medicine and nutritional supplements. Whisking in other healthful ingredients, such as soy protein, ginseng or wheat germ, boosts their already high nutritional value. </p><p> If your immune system is compromised, or if you are recovering from surgery or a major illness, vegetable smoothies will be of tremendous help. Make them with fresh vegetables and the healing herbs recommended for your health condition (see page 19). All of the vegetable smoothies may be served hot. They are especially beneficial to people who may not be able to take whole meals. </p><p> It has been said that you don't need a recipe book to make a smoothie. Although that's basically true -- liquid and fresh fruits or vegetables are all it takes to make a blended drink -- there is so much more to smoothies. In addition to a cornucopia of tangy fruit concoctions, this books offers hot smoothies, healing smoothies, vegetable smoothies, cheese smoothies and smoothies made with milk substitutes -- all new and delicious ways to drink to your health. </p><p> <i>Skoal,<br> Pat Crocker</i> </p></p><h2>Shadow of the Giant (Shadow Saga)</h2><p><p><b>The Ender Saga continues with <i>Shadow of the Giant</i>, which parallels the events of <i>Ender's Game</i> from a different character&#x2019;s point of view.</b></p><p>Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.</p><p>For Earth was at war - a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth - they had time to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. That story is told in two books, Orson Scott Card's beloved classic <i>Ender's Game</i>, and its parallel, <i>Ender's Shadow</i>. Now, in <i>Shadow of the Giant</i>, Bean's story continues.</p><p>Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he became Ender Wiggins' right hand, Since then he has grown to be a power on Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender's defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he has never known - but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his enemies - old enemies from the days in Ender's Jeesh, new enemies from the wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in Ender's footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the Hegemon, and look to the stars.</p><p>THE ENDER UNIVERSE</p><p>Ender series<br><i>Ender&#x2019;s Game</i> / <i>Speaker for the Dead </i>/ <i>Xenocide </i>/ <i>Children of the Mind </i>/<i> Ender in Exile </i>/ <i>Children of the Fleet</i></p><p>Ender&#x2019;s Shadow series<br><i>Ender&#x2019;s Shadow </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Hegemon </i>/ <i>Shadow Puppets </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Giant </i>/ <i>Shadows in Flight</i></p><p>The First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br><i>Earth Unaware </i>/ <i>Earth Afire </i>/ <i>Earth Awakens</i></p><p>The Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br><i>The Swarm </i>/ <i>The Hive</i></p><p>Ender novellas<br><i>A War of Gifts </i>/ <i>First Meetings</i></p></p><p><p><b><em>A Reading Guide for Ender's Game.</em> </b></p> <p><b>THE ENDER UNIVERSE</b></p> <p><b>Ender's Series</b>: Ender Wiggin: The finest general the world could hope to find or breed. </p> <p> The following Ender's Series titles are listed in order: Ender's Game, Ender In Exile, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind.</p> <p><b>Ender's Shadow Series</b>: Parallel storylines to <i>Ender&#x2019;s Game</i> from Bean: Ender&#x2019;s right hand, his strategist, and his friend. </p> <p> The following Ender's Shadow Series titles are listed in order: Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant, Shadows in Flight.</p> <p><b>The First Formic War Series</b>: One hundred years before <i>Ender's Game</i>, the aliens arrived on Earth with fire and death.

This short, readable book speaks to the importance of good theology for godly living. Part of the <em>9Marks Building Healthy Churches</em> series.</p></p><p><p><strong>Bobby Jamieson</strong> is the assistant editor for 9Marks and managing editor of the <em>9Marks Journal</em>. Jamieson, a member of Third Avenue Baptist Church, is currently an MDiv student at Southern Seminary, and lives with his wife and two daughters in Louisville, Kentucky. He is also the author of the 9Marks Healthy Church Study Guides.</p><p>&#x201c;Scripture is for sound doctrine, sound doctrine is for real life, and real life is for real church growth. So says Jamieson, and he hits the nail on the head brilliantly every time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. I. Packer</strong><strong>,</strong> Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College<em></em></p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Pay heed to your doctrine.&#x2019; That imperative for faithful Christianity sounds to many Christians altogether abstract and remote from the life of the church. Bobby Jamieson believes otherwise, and <em>Sound Doctrine</em> is a masterful argument for doctrine that is not only deeply rooted in the church, but also produces a church that demonstrates both the grace and glory of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. Albert Mohler Jr.</strong><strong>,</strong> President, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;A true Christian experience involves more than sound doctrine, but it is nothing without it. Bobby helps us see how sound doctrine not only shapes but also empowers all ministries in the local church, from effective outreach to authentic small groups. This book could serve as a starting point for thinking through a philosophy of ministry.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. D. Greear</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, The Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; author, <em>Not God Enough</em> and <em>Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart</em></p><p>&#x201c;Truth is for life. Teaching is for living. Sound doctrine is for love, unity, worship, witness, and joy. That is what this book is all about. Christians need to understand how sound biblical teaching&#x2015;doctrine that is based on and drawn from the Holy Scriptures&#x2015;informs every aspect of Christian life and experience. Bobby Jamieson makes that case in <em>Sound Doctrine</em>. The argument is brief, biblical, interesting, and compelling. The book won&#x2019;t take you long to read, but its contents will pay dividends to Christians and churches for a long time to come.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. Ligon Duncan III</strong><strong>,</strong> Chancellor, CEO, and John E. Richards Professor of Systematic and Historical Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;I sit next to Bobby Jamieson in a seminary class, so I can tell you that he is a very smart guy, a genuine nerd, theologically discerning, and&#x2015;surprisingly&#x2015;an avid surfer. Prior to my conversion, I sat next to smart guys like Bobby in order to cheat, but now I do it to learn&#x2015;and there&#x2019;s a lot to learn from Bobby! If you don&#x2019;t understand why sound doctrine is important, or realize the difference it can make, then Bobby has something to teach you. In this book you&#x2019;ll learn that sound doctrine is as delightful as it is practical&#x2015;for everyday life and for the church. Come sit next to Bobby with me.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>C.J. Mahaney</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville</p><p>&#x201c;Think doctrine is at least impractical&#x2015;at worst, loveless? Give this author a few minutes to help you reconsider this. Well-written, precise, provocative, and practical&#x2015;Jamieson has produced a jewel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark Dever</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DC; President, 9Marks</p><p>&#x201c;Doctrine that is biblically faithful and practically relevant is essential to the health and life of the church. Without it, churches will become anemic and eventually die. <em>Sound Doctrine</em> is a short primer on the key doctrines of holiness, love, unity, worship, and witness. In a careful and well-written treatise, Bobby Jamieson walks us through these crucial doctrines, revealing their importance to our mind and heart&#x2015;to our individual lives and the community of faith.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel L. Akin</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;If ever you&#x2019;ve been tempted to think that doctrine is boring, divisive, or just plain pointless, this is a book for you. Bobby Jamieson shows that sound doctrine is beautiful, life imparting, and deeply desirable. I hope this message goes far and wide.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Reeves</strong>, President and Professor of Theology, Union School of Theology</p></p><h2>Meet the Puritans: With a Guide to Modern Reprints</h2><p>This encyclopedic resource provides biographical sketches of all the major Puritans as well as bibliographic summaries of their writings and work.

I am confident that God will mightily use this mind-enriching, heart-warming, and soul-satisfying publication to arouse new interest in the Puritans, to stimulate demand for their books, and so to multiply among us the Christ-centered lives they so passionately promoted. --Dr. David Murray<br><br>As furnaces burn with ancient coal and not with the leaves that fall from today s trees, so my heart is kindled with the fiery substance I find in the old Scripture-steeped sermons of Puritan pastors.

JOHN PIPER, Pastor, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota<br><br>The Puritans English, Scottish, American, and Dutch are being read again! In an era of superficial discipleship and erratic, impotent, ailing, and dying churches, this is indeed a hopeful sign. And this wide-ranging handbook of backup information about the writers themselves, their special strengths, and modern reprints of their books, is another hopeful sign. <i>Meet the Puritans</i> is a fascinating compendium, scholarly yet popular and accessible, that Puritan-lovers will value very highly and justly so. --DR.

The first contingent killed people and destroyed buildings, roads, and other structures. The second rained down fire, turning the streets into a blast furnace, the shelters into ovens, and whipping up a molten hurricane in which the citizens of Dresden were burned, baked, or suffocated to death. </p><p>Early the next day, American bombers finished off what was left. Sinclair McKay&#x2019;s <i>The Fire and the Darkness </i>is a pulse-pounding work of history that looks at the life of the city in the days before the attack, tracks each moment of the bombing, and considers the long period of reconstruction and recovery. <i>The Fire and the Darkness</i> is powered by McKay&#x2019;s reconstruction of this unthinkable terror from the points of view of the ordinary civilians: Margot Hille, an apprentice brewery worker; Gisela Reichelt, a ten-year-old schoolgirl; boys conscripted into the Hitler Youth; choristers of the Kreuzkirche choir; artists, factory floor managers, shop assistants, and classical musicians, as well as the Nazi officials stationed there. </p><p>What happened that night in Dresden was calculated annihilation in a war that was almost over.

Now he brings his historical acumen and political savvy to this fresh, new interpretation of <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, the 18th-century collection of political essays that defined and shaped our Constitution and laid bare the &#x201c;original argument&#x201d; between states&#x2019; rights and big federal government--a debate as relevant and urgent today as it was at the birth of our nation. <p></p> <p>Adapting a selection of these essential essays--pseudonymously authored by the now well-documented triumvirate of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay--for a contemporary audience, Glenn Beck has had them reworked into &#x201c;modern&#x201d; English so as to be thoroughly accessible to anyone seeking a better understanding of the Founding Fathers&#x2019; intent and meaning when laying the groundwork of our government.

His classic work, <em>Introduction to the Spiritual Life</em>&#x2014;first published in English in 1961 and now brought back into print&#x2014;provides readers with an inspiring and comprehensive vision of Christian spirituality that is unmatched in its warmth, lucidity, and accessibility.<br><br><em>Introduction to the Spiritual Life</em> is, by author Louis Bouyer&#x2019;s own description, a manual for practical use. Much more than just a work of &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d; or &#x201c;apologetics,&#x201d; it is a hybrid of both, produced with an expertise and confidence borne of a lifetime of prayer and study. It aims to cultivate interior growth through a thoughtful, reasoned meditation on the spiritual meaning of the Gospel as proclaimed by the Catholic Church. Catholics who read Introduction to the Spiritual Life will better appreciate how a life of prayer can be shaped and enriched by sound Christian doctrine.</p><p>Louis Bouyer (1913-2004) was a member of the French Oratory and one of the most respected and versatile Catholic scholars and theologians of the twentieth century. A friend of Hans Urs von Balthasar, Joseph Ratzinger, and J.R.R. Tolkien, and a cofounder of the international review <i>Communio</i>, Bouyer was a former Lutheran minister who entered the Catholic Church in 1939. He became a leading figure in the Catholic biblical and liturgical movements of the twentieth century, was an influence on the Second Vatican Council, and became well known for his excellent books on history of Christian spirituality.

Comprised of ancient plots both poignant and comical, this anthology contains simple truths, common sense, and the promise that we can benefit from past generations' wisdom and experience.<br><br></p><p>By metaphorically suggesting constructive strategies for living, these ancient tales resonate with a universal appeal. "The characters in these stories may gain wisdom by observing a good example or by bumbling through their own folly," Heather Forest observes. "I hope these stories will provide discussion and offer insight into joys, sorrows, fears and farce of human experience." Wisdom tales offer useful insights into life's joys and sorrows that all of us experience.</p></p><p><p><strong>Heather Forest Bio: </strong><br><br></p><p>Heather Forest's unique minstrel style of telling stories blends her original music, folk guitar, poetry, and prose along with song and the spoken word to give her stories an uncommon warmth and charm.

Heather's books have received many prestigious awards including the Children's Choice Award, Parent's Choice Award, CCBC Choices, ABC Best Books for Children, Best Children's Books of the Year, Book Sense Winter Children's Picks, and the National Parenting Publication Awards (NAPPA) among others.<br><br></p><p>Heather is currently working on her tenth book with August House, a collection of ancient and epic tales.

Grouped by cultural or religious tradition, the selections comprise tales as familiar as ``The Three Wishes'' and the story of the Prodigal Son, and as unfamiliar as the legend, heard from a Yup'ik storyteller, of Apanugpak, a mighty warrior who laid down his weapons. Some are linked to historical events, and many have exotic settings, but Forest writes in such a simple, direct way that even readers not acquainted with the stories' contexts will grasp the particulars. She uses specific names or terms sparingly and livens the prose with occasional apt, clever rhymes. Two pages of proverbs (``the essence of wisdom tales without the storyline'') and a section of analytical and source notes close out this readable, often funny, and consistently thought-provoking collection.

The three books are <em>The Timeless Way of Building,</em> <em>A Pattern Language</em>, and <em>The Oregon Experiment.</em> <br><br>At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation fo the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. <br><br>This book is the master plan for the University of Oregon, and is now being implemented at that university; but it shows at the same time how any community the size of a university or small town might go about designing its own future environment-with all members of the community participating personally. It is a concrete example at the Center's theories in practice, showing in simple detail, with numerous illustrations, how to implement six guiding principles: organic order, participation, piecemeal growth, patterns, diagnosis, and coordination.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Alexander</strong> is a builder, craftsman, general contractor, architect, painter, and teacher. He taught from 1963 to 2002 as Professor of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and is now Professor Emeritus.

But, at forty-eight years old, having spent decades in San Francisco, he craved change. Grieving over the death of his partner, he quickly discovered the profound consolations of the city&#x2019;s incessant rhythms, the sight of the Empire State Building against the night sky, and New Yorkers themselves, kindred souls that Hayes, a lifelong insomniac, encountered on late-night strolls with his camera. </p><p>And he unexpectedly fell in love again, with his friend and neighbor, the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose exuberance--"I don&#x2019;t so much fear death as I do wasting life," he tells Hayes early on--is captured in funny and touching vignettes throughout. What emerges is a portrait of Sacks at his most personal and endearing, from falling in love for the first time at age seventy-five to facing illness and death (Sacks died of cancer in August 2015).<i>Insomniac City </i>is both a meditation on grief and a celebration of life. Filled with Hayes&#x2019;s distinctive street photos of everyday New Yorkers, the book is a love song to the city and to all who have felt the particular magic and solace it offers.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2017:</strong> The late, great Oliver Sacks was so famously private, he didn&#x2019;t divulge that he was gay until his memoir, <em>On the Move</em>, was published, shortly before his death at the age of 82. Granted, this revelation was one of the least interesting things about him. Sacks was widely beloved, which is saying something for a scarily brilliant, yet somewhat reclusive neurologist. But his childlike wonder and ability to wrap our brains around the complexities of everything from music to migraines to the cancer he succumbed to, was infectious, and the graciousness--and extraordinary gratitude--with which he accepted his terminal diagnosis earned him even further admiration. It stands to reason, then, that Sacks&#x2019;s life partner must be pretty remarkable as well, and <em>Insomniac City</em> provides ample proof. In this affectionate and magnanimous memoir, author and photographer Bill Hayes pays tribute to their relationship, and provides a paean to one of the other loves of his life: New York City. Hayes&#x2019;s contagious regard for the Big Apple makes you almost believe that getting lost on the subway is a happy accident (almost!), and his Humans of New York-esque vignettes inspire the same esteem and faith in humanity as Brandon Stanton&#x2019;s blog of the same name. Add to that a couple of delightfully unlikely cameos from Bj�rk and a black-eyed Lauren Hutton, and you won&#x2019;t want to sleep until the last page of <em>Insomniac City</em> is turned. Somewhere, Oliver Sacks is smiling. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Bill Hayes</b><b> </b>is the author of <i>The Anatomist</i>, <i>Five Quarts</i>, and <i>Sleep Demons</i>.

David Hajdu's remarkable new book vividly opens up the lost world of comic books, its creativity, irreverence, and suspicion of authority.</b></p><p>In the years between World War II and the emergence of television as a mass medium, American popular culture as we know it was first created&#x2015;in the pulpy, boldly illustrated pages of comic books. No sooner had this new culture emerged than it was beaten down by church groups, community bluestockings, and a McCarthyish Congress&#x2015;only to resurface with a crooked smile on its face in <i>Mad </i>magazine.</p><p>When we picture the 1950s, we hear the sound of early rock and roll. <i>The Ten-Cent Plague </i>shows how -- years before music -- comics brought on a clash between children and their parents, between prewar and postwar standards. Created by outsiders from the tenements, garish, shameless, and often shocking, comics spoke to young people and provided the guardians of mainstream culture with a big target. Parents, teachers, and complicit kids burned comics in public bonfires. Cities passed laws to outlaw comics. Congress took action with televised hearings that nearly destroyed the careers of hundreds of artists and writers.</p><p><i>The Ten-Cent Plague </i>radically revises common notions of popular culture, the generation gap, and the divide between "high" and "low" art. As he did with the lives of Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington (in <i>Lush Life</i>) and Bob Dylan and his circle (in <i>Positively 4th Street</i>), Hajdu brings a place, a time, and a milieu unforgettably back to life.</p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, March 2008: I may be alone here, but when I read Michael Chabon's <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i>, a whole strata of American artists came to life for me. Ever since then I've been waiting for a book like David Hajdu's <i>The Ten-Cent Plague</i> to come along and show me the contours of this world. Anyone who remembers <i>Positively 4th Street</i> will recognize in this new book Hajdu's peerless ability to weave first-person recollections with an acute perspective of America at a pivotal moment in its cultural timeline. The rise of comics as a mode of expression, an outlet for entertainment, and, rather tragi-comically, as a target for censorship, couldn't be more compelling in anyone else's hands. In deft narrative strokes Hajdu creates a colorful, character-driven story of our first real--and lasting--counterculture (if the burgeoning popularity of graphic novels is any indication) and shows why we embrace it still.<i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br><p><b>David Hajdu</b> is the author of <i>Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn</i> and <i>Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fari�a and Richard Fari�a.</i></p></p><h2>For Bread Alone</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A true story of human desperation, shattering in its impact.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tennessee Williams</p><p>Driven by famine from their home in the Rif, Mohamed&#x2019;s family walks to Tangiers in search of a better life.

When artist Jenny Holzer installed this slogan-one of her personal "truisms," about how advertising elicits desire for things we do not need and may not even want-intentionally or not she was making a compelling comment on the Buddha's Four Noble Truths and the barrier to happiness that each of us encounters.<br><br><b>Teachings</b><br><br>The first step of the Eightfold Path--right understanding, also called right view--like many spiritual conditions, emerged from the personal experiences of one individual, in this case the man we know as the Buddha ("Awakened One"). The historical Buddha was born Siddhartha Gautama, a prince of the Sakya clan (Shakyamuni Buddha), in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal in the sixth century b.c.e. Before his birth, a seer had foretold that the child would grow up to be either a great ruler or a great holy man, and his father did everything possible to ensure that Siddhartha would actualize the first possibility rather than the second and succeed him as the chief of the clan. Siddhartha was exposed to continuous sense pleasures while being shielded from anything unpleasant that might divert him from the course his father had set for him. Nevertheless, as an adult, on each of four outings from the palace, Siddhartha had an experience that stunned him. He encountered, for the first time in his life, a very sick person, a very old person, mourners around a person who had died, and an ascetic holy man, a sadhu. Each time, Siddhartha asked his charioteer what he was seeing, and he was shocked to learn that illness, old age, and death are inescapably part of the human condition-including his own-and that there are spiritual seekers questioning just what it means to be born into this human body and to have to endure such suffering.<br><br>At the age of twenty-nine, Siddhartha renounced his lavish life, left his family, and sought the meaning of human life among the greatest teachers of northern India as an ascetic who sometimes, it is said, ate only one grain of rice a day. His quest and his subsequent teachings were rooted in their yogic traditions, in which individuals renounced life as householders in order to seek spiritual truth. After six years he realized that he could no more Wnd spiritual answers by living a life of stark deprivation than through princely self-indulgence, and he embraced what has come to be known as the Middle Way between such extremes. On the night of the full moon in May on his thirty-fifth birthday, Siddhartha sat beneath a bodhi (fig) tree near Bodhgaya, in northern India, and vowed not to get up until he had achieved full enlightenment. Over the course of that night, he experienced all the temptations to which the mind is vulnerable, saw human suffering over many lifetimes, and came to understand the Four Noble Truths as well as the law of karma (causality), the impermanence of all conditioned things, and the absence of an autonomous and permanent self.</p><h2>A Doll&#39;s House - Literary Touchstone Classics Edition</h2><p>This Prestwick House <i>Literary Touchstone Classics</i> edition includes a glossary and notes to help the modern reader contend with Ibsen's approach to complex human interactions and the relationship between the sexes.<p><br>Norwegian-born Henrik Ibsen's classic play about the struggle between independence and security still resonates with readers and audience members today.

In 1836 his father went bankrupt, and the family was reduced to near poverty. At the age of fifteen, he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Grimstad. In 1850 Ibsen ventured to Christiania<b> </b>present-day Oslo<b> </b>as a student, with the hope of becoming a doctor. On the strength of his first two plays he was appointed &#x201c;theater-poet&#x201d; to the new Bergen National Theater, where he wrote five conventional romantic and historical dramas and absorbed the elements of his craft. In 1857 he was called to the directorship of the financially unsound Christiania Norwegian Theater, which failed in 1862. In 1864, exhausted and enraged by the frustration of his efforts toward a national drama and theater, he quit Norway for what became twenty-seven years of voluntary exile abroad. In Italy he wrote the volcanic <b>Brand</b> (1866), which made his reputation and secured him a poet&#x2019;s stipend from the government. Its companion piece, the phantasmagoric <b>Peer Gynt</b>, followed in 1867, then the immense double play, <b>Emperor and Galilean</b> (1873), expressing his philosophy of civilization. Meanwhile, having moved to Germany, Ibsen had been searching for a new style. With <b>The Pillars of Society</b> he found it; this became the first of twelve plays, appearing at two-year intervals, that confirmed his international standing as the foremost dramatist of his age. In 1900 Ibsen suffered the first of several strokes that incapacitated him. He died in Oslo on May 23, 1906.</p><h2>How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen</h2><p>Tom is so good at fooling around that he does little else.

He was one of more than three thousand passengers on the cruise ship, midway between Sardinia and Sicily. His home in Scottsdale, Arizona, was six thousand miles and eight time zones away. Now that the ship&#x2019;s Internet service had finally been restored, Frank just wanted to know two things: That the video cameras installed in his house were working. And that his house was safe and secure.</p><p>The man&#x2019;s wife was up on the deck. She didn&#x2019;t think he should be worrying about the house. She thought he should be relaxing and actually enjoying this cruise, after waiting so many years to do this. After spending twelve grand to make this trip happen.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll start enjoying this, Frank said to himself, when I can get a little peace of mind.</p><p>He checked the first video feed. It came from the X10 Internet camera mounted on the bookshelf next to the fireplace. It was positioned so that the lens would look through the legs of a wooden elephant, and it communicated wirelessly with the server in the study, which in turn fed the images to the Web. Available to see anytime, anywhere in the world. At least when the Internet was working.</p><p>The live image, as Frank hit the key to bring it up, showed the front door and half of the living room. Everything looked normal to him, and yet not normal in a way he couldn&#x2019;t identify.</p><p>He kept looking at the image. The couch, the door, the little welcome mat to wipe the desert sand off your feet when you came in.</p><p>What&#x2019;s wrong with this picture?</p><p>Then it finally hit him. There was too much light.</p><p>It was early in the morning back home, which on most days would mean that sunlight should be coming through the big window in the kitchen. Just as it seemed to be doing here.</p><p>But when they had left the house, those curtains had been closed. Frank was sure of that.</p><p>He clicked the link to restart the video, which ran on a continuous eight-hour loop. The image jumped back eight hours to darkness, the only light a thin glow from the one lamp they had left on in the living room. He hit the fast-forward button and watched the image flicker, the minutes passing by in fast motion, with no movement.</p><p>Until there was.</p><p>It was just a flash. He backed up the video, then ran it at normal speed. The front door opened. How could it be unlocked? This video would never reveal that secret to him&#x2014;he could only go back eight hours, and as of eight hours ago, the door was obviously unlocked and any goddamned person in the world could walk right into their house.</p><p>Like this stranger.</p><p>Who was in their house.</p><p>Frank paused the video to get a better look. The man was tall and well-built, a few years younger than Frank, with fair skin and long brown hair that went down to his shoulders. He was dressed in black jeans and a black button-down shirt. Black shoes. Even a black baseball cap, his brown hair trailing down the back of his neck. Frank&#x2019;s mind caught on the hair first&#x2014;he&#x2019;d always hated long hair on men. Then on something else, a certain quality about the man himself, how he moved with complete composure. No rush. No nerves. Like he was actually comfortable being in another man&#x2019;s house after dark. Frank watched as the man crossed the room, moving from the front door toward the hallway.</p><p>Frank hit the pause button again, sat there going through a series of emotions. Shock, anger, surprise. And if he was being honest with himself, a slight tinge of excitement.</p><p>This thing really works.</p><p>He switched to the kitchen feed, went back eight hours, ran it through at fast speed, watching for the same kind of flash. As he was doing this, his wife came back to their stateroom.</p><p>&#x201c;Marion, look at this!&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s someone in our house!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down.&#x201d; Frank went back to the living room feed, found the time stamp when the front door had been opened. Just after midnight, Arizona time. Eight in the morning on the ship&#x2019;s time.</p><p>Marion watched the video, looking confused and skeptical until she saw the man walking through her living room. Her eyes went wide.</p><p>&#x201c;How did he get in? We have to call somebody!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a minute,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find out where he went. Let me see if he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Frank didn&#x2019;t finish the thought. He had switched to the bedroom feed now. The camera was mounted on top of the armoire in the master bedroom, partially covered by the arrangement of silk flowers in a basket. It looked down on the bed and the dresser with the jewelry box on top. All of Marion&#x2019;s diamonds were in that box. He hadn&#x2019;t let her bring any of them on this trip, a pronouncement he was already regretting. The apology was half formed on his lips when the screen went from black to something else.</p><p>A light had been turned on. In their bedroom.</p><p>The stranger stood in the doorway, looking at a woman who was already lying on the bed. Waiting for him.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our bed,&#x201d; Marion said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s our bed.&#x201d;</p><p>The man stepped forward. He stood over the woman and looked down at her for a long time.</p><p>Frank was about to pause the video. No need to see what came next. But Marion stopped him.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with her?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Look at that woman, Frank&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked closely. The woman was lying on her back, her hands folded together on her stomach. She wasn&#x2019;t moving.</p><p>Her skin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>White. Like wax. Her mouth was open. Her eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Staring at nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Marion said. &#x201c;That woman, she&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t finish the thought.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t have to.</p><p>Frank and Marion Thompson sat in their cabin and watched the stranger in their bedroom as he began to take off his clothes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Chapter One</p><p>There are some things a man should never have to see.</p><p>Roger Halliday had an older brother who&#x2019;d done three tours in Vietnam. When he&#x2019;d asked him what had happened over there, that&#x2019;s what his brother had told him. Those exact words, and nothing more.</p><p>Forty plus years later, his brother long gone, Roger Halliday was an FBI agent taking his last lap before retirement. He&#x2019;d started as a probie on an Evidence Response Team, put in some time with the Behavioral Analysis Unit before going mainline with the Criminal Investigative Division. So he&#x2019;d seen his share of dead bodies, shot or stabbed or thrown off a thirty-two-story building onto the hood of a car.</p><p>But he&#x2019;d never seen anything like this.</p><p>&#x201c;How many times did you watch it?&#x201d; his partner asked. Agent Juwan Cook, in the Bureau for eight years now. He was black, with a smooth head he shaved every morning and a thin mustache. Cook kept his eyes straight ahead as he drove.</p><p>&#x201c;Three times,&#x201d; Halliday said. The first time, it had been just a matter of getting through it. When it was done, he had watched it again. Twice. Looking for details. Doing his job.</p><p>Cook shook his head and kept driving.</p><p>The house was on the north side of Scottsdale, up by the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. One of those places you drive by and imagine yourself living someday, if you work long enough and are smart with your money. Spanish architecture, the standard for any house in this neighborhood. Clay tiles on the roof, an in-ground pool in the back. Five thousand square feet, one story, easier to keep cool in the summer. A single strip of grass, just a token amount of green for the dog to walk on. Everything else typical Arizona&#x2014;rock, gravel, and cactus.</p><p>Once they turned down the street, it wasn&#x2019;t hard to find the Thompsons&#x2019; house. There were already half a dozen police vehicles lined up on the street, and there were so many men walking through the yard it was raising a dust cloud you could see from two miles away.</p><p>Halliday had gotten the call just after eleven thirty, the last link in a long chain that had started somewhere on the Mediterranean Sea. It was almost noon now, on a clear February day, seventy-six degrees on the car&#x2019;s digital thermometer, the kind of day that makes Arizona feel pretty much perfect. Halliday wished the call had come in sooner, that he had had the chance to get here first, to see the house, to see the victim. He wasn&#x2019;t looking forward to pulling rank when he finally got here&#x2014;that was the kind of thing that made the local cops hate the &#x201c;feebs,&#x201d; if they didn&#x2019;t already. But this was going to be his case. He could feel it.</p><p>After chasing him around California, Utah, Nevada, and now Arizona, this UNSUB, the unknown subject &nbsp;suspected in the abduction and murder of at least five other women, had finally left a victim in the wrong place.</p><p>But why here?</p><p>Halliday tried to see this house the way the UNSUB would have seen it. A quiet street, not many neighbors. They had driven by a guard shack on the main road, but the UNSUB would have known this was just for show. With all of the trails in the preserve running along the backs of these property lines&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There were plenty of ways to get to the house. You do it at night, and nobody sees you.</p><p>But as easy as it would be to get in, he had to know this place would have something else: a level of internal security that would make it different from all of the other places he&#x2019;d used before. Sure, maybe the owner of this house put too much trust in the guard shack and didn&#x2019;t have an alarm, but those Internet cameras he&#x2019;d installed&#x2014;the cameras that recorded everything that happened inside that house&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The UNSUB should have suspected they were there. And even if he&#x2019;d decided it was worth the risk, he should have found them and disabled them.</p><p>He&#x2019;d never been this sloppy before.</p><p>So maybe this is someone else, Halliday thought. But no. No way. He thought back to everything he&#x2019;d seen on that video&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How many human beings on this planet are capable of doing something like that?</p><p>It had to be the same man.</p><p>Cook pulled off the street and stopped behind a long line of squad cars. As Halliday led the way up the sidewalk to the front door, he was already getting the once-over from the uniformed locals. Everything about him, from the ground up, screamed Fed: his shoes, his suit, the expression on his face. Nobody tried to stop him. He asked the uniform standing by the door for the name of the man in charge and was sent in to see Detective Millens from Scottsdale PD. He found the man standing alone in the kitchen, in plain clothes, a gold shield shining on his belt. He was young for a detective, around Cook&#x2019;s age, and he was busy talking into his cell phone. As soon as Millens saw Halliday, he ended the call.</p><p>Halliday got out his ID and showed it to him. Then he introduced Cook.</p><p>&#x201c;Back of the house,&#x201d; the detective said. &#x201c;Master bedroom.&#x201d;</p><p>As Halliday followed Millens, he looked down at the carpeting in the hallway and saw the shoeprints.</p><p>&#x201c;How many of your men have been in here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; the detective said, looking back at him. &#x201c;Maybe three.&#x201d;</p><p>Halliday scanned the rest of the hallway with a frown as the detective led them into the bedroom. That was where he saw the body on the bed. It was covered by a white sheet.</p><p>Halliday took a moment to walk around the room. He looked out the window at the backyard&#x2014;more rock, gravel, cactus&#x2014;and at the road that looped around the lot and started climbing up toward Dixie Mountain. He stood motionless for a full minute, looking at every window in the neighboring houses, every vantage point from the road, every spot on the preserve where a man could use a set of high-powered binoculars to peer right into this room.</p><p>He could be out there right now, Halliday thought, watching us.</p><p>But something tells me he&#x2019;s not there. Not now.</p><p>&#x201c;Were these curtains open?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the detective said.</p><p>&#x201c;Was the light on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Halliday left the window and went to the big jewelry box on the dresser, took out a pen, and used it to gently lift the lid. Nothing looked out of place. No conspicuous blank spots from which something might have been taken. So probably nothing stolen, even though, to his untrained eye, it looked like there were some real diamonds that would be worth putting in your pocket on the way out.</p><p>Halliday took a quick look in the bathroom, came back out and stood at the foot of the bed. The body lay in a straight line, perfectly centered on the bed, and even with the sheet over it he could tell that the arms had been folded neatly across the chest.</p><p>Five minutes in the house and he had already decided what needed to be done. Even if he knew it wouldn&#x2019;t be popular.</p><p>&#x201c;Everybody out!&#x201d; he said, moving to the doorway so that anyone else in the house could hear him. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand if you need to take over the crime scene,&#x201d; Millens said, &#x201c;but the ME&#x2019;s on his way right now and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Halliday said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not moving the body.&#x201d;</p><p>Millens took a moment to process what he was hearing. He looked back and forth between Halliday and Cook.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come back again tonight,&#x201d; Halliday said. &#x201c;She needs to be here. One more night.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t feel like giving the detective a crash course on how a certain kind of &#x201c;organized&#x201d; serial killer works, the kind of killer who returns to the body several times after death for his further sexual gratification.</p><p>Like Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer.</p><p>Like Ted Bundy.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not leaving her here,&#x201d; Millens said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to. Think about it, Agent Halliday. If he comes back, you can still catch him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Halliday said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll know if the body is gone. He won&#x2019;t come anywhere near this place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving her here,&#x201d; Millens said, nodding toward the body under the sheet. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that simple.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not your call to make,&#x201d; Cook said, standing next to his partner.</p><p>&#x201c;Get all of your men out of here,&#x201d; Halliday said. &#x201c;Make everything look exactly like it did. I mean everything, right down to those footprints in the hallway. Which never should have happened, Detective. Find a rake, a brush, whatever it takes. In thirty minutes, I want this place to look untouched.&#x201d;</p><p>Millens just stood there, looking back and forth between the agents.</p><p>&#x201c;The sheet over the body,&#x201d; Halliday said, knowing this would be the hardest part. &#x201c;I assume you did that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Millens said. &#x201c;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fucking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it. After you&#x2019;ve left.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When they find out you didn&#x2019;t let us take her away&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t help her now,&#x201d; Halliday said. &#x201c;What we can do is stop this guy before he kills ten more.&#x201d;</p><p>Millens shook his head and left the room without saying another word.

While students might approach the book for casual reference or brief readings, it does lack a unifying narrative or appealing visuals. Readers will open with an introduction to the skin and immune system and then encounter a new class of irritant with each chapter&#x2014;lice, fleas, plants, fungus, etc. Informative descriptions outline the mechanism of common itchy irritants, including the tiny stinging spines (glochids) that cover the prickly pear cactus or the irritating setae that tarantulas rip from their hind legs and fling at potential predators. Many remedies are offered, particularly traditional, folk, or nontoxic solutions, such as using fresh cucumber to soothe the irritation from stinging nettle or massaging a dog with coconut oil for treatment of flea bites. Ford's illustrations are colorful and lighthearted but add little to the text, particularly in exposition of scientific research. There are no photographs.

In this work, Burroughs&#x2019; parody becomes a set of rationales and instructions for destabilizing the state and overthrowing an oppressive and corrupt government. As with much of Burroughs&#x2019; work, it is hard to say if it is serious or purely satire.

Burroughs was a primary figure of the Beat Generation who wrote in the postmodern paranoid fiction genre.

And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus's master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. <br>&nbsp;<br><br>Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus's stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves. <br>&nbsp;<br><br>This first installment of Rick Riordan's best-selling series is a non-stop thrill-ride and a classic&nbsp;of mythic proportions.<br> <br> <br> <p> <strong>Amazon Interview: Rick Riordan on <i>The Lightning Thief</i></strong> </p> <p> </p><p>In our exclusive Q&amp;A with Rick Riordan, bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, learn about his inspiration for the character Percy Jackson, his long-time interest in Greek mythology, and more.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Since <i>The Lightning Thief</i> was published in 2005 it&#x2019;s sold more than a million copies, and the four subsequent books in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series have been blockbuster bestsellers among kids and adult readers alike. When you were writing the first story starring Percy Jackson, did you ever imagine it would become such a phenomenon? How has the success of the series affected your life?</p> <p><b>Rick Riordan:</b> I had no expectations other than to make a good story for my older son, Haley. I had no idea it would become a book, much less a series, until he encouraged me to write down the story.</p> <p>I hoped the stories would get kids reading, but I never anticipated such exponential growth. It was not an overnight success, nor was it heavily marketed at the beginning. <i>The Lightning Thief</i> was passed around from kid to kid, teacher to teacher, parent to parent, and the series got bigger with each book. It really was a grassroots phenomenon. Still, I have trouble thinking in terms of millions. I measure success by anecdotes--the kid who told me he never liked books until he found <i>The Lightning Thief</i>, the parent who thanked me for turning her daughter into a reader, the teacher who said I turned her class around because they bonded over reading Percy Jackson every day. That's what it's all about for me.</p> <p>It hasn't changed our life much other than making me busier, but doing something I love! I still drive the same car. My kids go to the same schools. We try our best to keep things simple at home.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You&#x2019;ve said that you wrote this series for your son, Haley, who, like the book&#x2019;s hero Percy, has been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. How does Haley feel about being the inspiration for a bestselling series?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> Both my sons are always my first audience. I read the manuscripts to them aloud to make sure they work for young readers. Both are proud, though being teenagers they are also embarrassed by the attention they get sometimes. They don&#x2019;t like it when classmates ask them to get my autograph. Haley likes to play down his importance in the genesis of the series, but I think he's enjoyed growing up with Percy, and I know it has increased his interest in writing. Recently he came into my office and announced the manuscript he is working on now has a bigger word count than mine! </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy&#x2019;s stories are based on Greek mythology--classic tales that have been passed down for thousands of years. What lessons can kids today learn from the ancient myths?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> The stories have everything--romance, magic, mystery, action, and great characters. The Greek gods are our first superheroes. They have amazing powers, but they are also very human and subject to jealousy, envy, anger, etc. Kids especially respond to them because they are both powerful and accessible. Who wouldn't want to be the son or daughter of a Greek god? By reading about the struggles of gods and heroes, we learn a lot about being human, and that's something that hasn't changed over the millennia.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Have you ever visited Greece? What was it like?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I&#x2019;ve been to both Italy and Greece, but only after I finished the Percy Jackson series, which is ironic. One doesn&#x2019;t need to travel there, however, to appreciate the stories from mythology. Those are quite universal. Greece actually reminded me quite a bit of my home in Texas--hot, green, hilly, somewhat arid, except the ocean is much better in Greece.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy&#x2019;s guardian satyr, Grover, is strongly connected to the Earth, the well-being of animals, and humans&#x2019; emotions. Moreover, Percy&#x2019;s life is relatively free of technology, in contrast to many people today. Is there a message about the natural world that you&#x2019;re hoping to convey through Percy and Grover?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I don&#x2019;t consciously put messages in the books, because my job is telling a good story, not preaching. However, I do pick up on themes from Greek mythology that still resonate in the modern world, and certainly man&#x2019;s relationship to nature is one of those. I&#x2019;ve always been fascinated by the god Pan, and his reported death in ancient times. It seemed a very relevant theme for modern readers.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy encounters many dangers throughout his adventures--some that could be considered beyond the abilities of a normal 12-year-old. Though we know Percy is no normal kid, where does he find the find the strength to overcome all the challenges that he encounters?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> None of us knows what we're capable of until we are called to action. Percy may have demigod abilities, but he's a very normal kid in a lot of ways. He goes from a 12-year-old who is unsure of himself and his relationship with his friends and family, to a 16-year-old young man who steps up and leads a war to save Olympus. Most heroes are born out of dire circumstances, and Percy is no exception. He's afraid, unsure, doubtful, angry--all the things we would be if we were called to deal with a crisis. But he does the job anyway, and that is the definition of courage.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> It&#x2019;s often said that writers write about what they know.

I had a great English teacher who showed me that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (the only series I would read at age thirteen) was based on Norse myths, and from then on, I was a mythology buff.

And it will deepen the affection the rest of us already hold for him and his fabulous creations. The author, photographer Pedro Guerrero, first took his camera to Calder's Connecticut studio in 1963, on a routine assignment with an editor from <i>House and Garden</i> magazine. As soon as they arrived at Calder's shambly, magical, jam-packed home, Guerrero could sense that the editor was less than enthralled. "If I had known you were going to photograph that room," she later sniffed, "I would have straightened the slipcovers."<p> "What a thing to notice!" writes Guerrero, who was, as he put it, "plotting my next move." Over the next 13 years, he photographed Calder, often with his beautiful wife, Louisa, in different houses and studios, all of them mesmerizingly overflowing with wire sculptures, homemade toys for their grandchildren, stabiles, mobiles, piles of mail, chairlike contraptions, and sculptural kitchen paraphernalia. "Be careful where you step," Calder warned Guerrero in the studio, "everything here is important."</p><p> <i>Calder at Home</i> is as playful and entertaining as the artist's famous <i>Circus</i> acrobats and animals installed (alas, behind glass) in the lobby of the Whitney Museum of American Art. From the foreword by Calder's grandson to Guerrero's final, pensive photograph of the master alchemist, this is a book to dream on. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p></p><h2>The Mote in God&#39;s Eye</h2><p>Writing separately, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are responsible for a number of science fiction classics, such as the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning<i>Ringworld, Debt of Honor,</i> and <i>The Integral Trees.</i> Together they have written the critically acclaimed bestsellers<i>Inferno, Footfall,</i> and <i>The Legacy of Heorot,</i> among others. <br><i>The Mote In God's Eye</i> is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel of mankind's first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre.</p><p>In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched.<p> In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they've been unable to solve in over a million years.</p><p> This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle's interest in the military and sociology with Niven's talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties' biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity's economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>Larry Niven trained as a mathematician. On turning his hand to writing he met with immediate success. He has since won three Hugo Awards and one Nebula Award with novels such as the classic &#39;Ringworld&#39; (which won both awards) and &#39;Tales of Known Space&#39;.

A few months later, the EPA disclosed that Volkswagen had installed software in 11 million cars that deceived emissions-testing mechanisms. By early 2017, VW had settled with American regulators and car owners for $20 billion, with additional lawsuits still looming. In <em>Faster, Higher, Farther</em>, Jack Ewing rips the lid off the conspiracy. He describes VW&#x2019;s rise from &#x201c;the people&#x2019;s car&#x201d; during the Nazi era to one of Germany&#x2019;s most prestigious and important global brands, touted for being &#x201c;green.&#x201d; He paints vivid portraits of Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Pi�ch and chief executive Martin Winterkorn, arguing that the corporate culture they fostered drove employees, working feverishly in pursuit of impossible sales targets, to illegal methods. Unable to build cars that could meet emissions standards in the United States honestly, engineers were left with no choice but to cheat. Volkswagen then compounded the fraud by spending millions marketing &#x201c;clean diesel,&#x201d; only to have the lie exposed by a handful of researchers on a shoestring budget, resulting in a guilty plea to criminal charges in a landmark Department of Justice case. <em>Faster, Higher, Farther</em> reveals how the succeed-at-all-costs mentality prevalent in modern boardrooms led to one of corporate history&#x2019;s farthest-reaching cases of fraud&#x2015;with potentially devastating consequences.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Jack Ewing has covered business and economics from Frankfurt for The New York Times since 2010. He has worked as a journalist in Germany since 1994, including over a decade as a BusinessWeek correspondent.&#x201c;This will go down in history books as a great corporate scandal , but the story told by the <em>New York Times</em> reporter Jack Ewing...is also much more than that. It&#x2019;s a rich history of a company whose cars, for better and worse, have touched millions of lives, a character study of a brilliant but deeply flawed leader, and a case study in how a corporate culture can turn toxic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bethany McLean, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Faster, Higher, Farther: The Volkswagen Scandal</em> takes readers through the combination of pressures that produced what may be the biggest corporate scandal ever, detailing the company&#x2019;s personalities and the history behind the saga with fluency and wit.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Atlantic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A shocking and incredibly compelling expos� of one of the great corporate scandals of all time....reads like a fast-paced thriller.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A damning indictment of corporate malfeasance and...an accessible account of one of the most expensive business mistakes ever recorded.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patrick McGee, <em>Financial Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Exhaustive.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Epstein, <em>Forbes</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Perversely engaging.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Barron's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating expos�....Ewing&#x2019;s compelling prose makes his book read like entertainment more than education and the story of Volkswagen&#x2019;s fall...is a study in corporate hubris.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is a corporate scandal to rival Enron and Lehman Brothers....Ewing weaves a conspiratorial tale of corporate greed run amok.

Here the three are pitted against Evaristus Sloane, an insane wizard and inventor. But even more frightening than Sloane is a robot he invented some 50 years before. The robot was built to look like a baseball player and to pitch balls, but the Professor, Johnny, and Fergie discover a much darker side to the mechanism. After finding the dismantled robot in an abandoned house, the Professor reassembles it. But after placing its eyes back in the empty sockets, the Professor realizes too late that he has resurrected a killer machine. Not only must the robot be stopped but also its mad inventor before Johnny loses his eyes and his life to a terrifying scheme. As always, Bellairs skillfully runs a current of evil just beneath the surface of the commonplace. The supernatural is mixed with the ordinary so effortlessly and so naturally as to make even the most bizarre people and situations seem possible in a very unsettling way. A unique plot, marvelous characters, and non-stop suspense make for deliciously wicked fun.

Kubo made his debut with <b><i>ZombiePowder</i></b>, a four-volume series for <b><i>Weekly&nbsp;Shonen Jump</i></b>. To date, Bleach has been translated into numerous languages and has also inspired an animated TV&nbsp;series that began airing in Japan in 2004. Beginning its serialization in 2001, Bleach is still a mainstay in the pages of&nbsp;<b><i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i></b>. In 2005, <b><i>Bleach</i></b> was awarded the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award in the shonen&nbsp;(boys)&nbsp;category.Gr 8 Up&#x2013;When Kubo, the creator of the original &#x201c;Bleach&#x201d; manga series, was asked to create some &#x201c;rough sketches&#x201d; of additional scenes that would take place in the Bleach universe, his output was quite prolific. In fact, he created so many sketches showcasing characters like the Soul Reapers that they were able to fill the first half of this book. In this color section, the artwork is definitely rougher than that in the original series, but the casual style matches the fun and fluffy stories in which serious characters show their lighter sides. The other half of the book features more polished black-and-white art and consists of something called Seireitei Bulletin, a handbook that is supposed to prepare readers for the Soul Reaper academy entrance exam. Superfans of the &#x201c;Bleach&#x201d; manga and anime series will be delighted with this behind-the-scenes look at some of their favorite characters from the 13 Court Guard Companies. Readers who are unfamiliar with Bleach, however, will have absolutely no idea what's going on, so this book is only recommended for libraries in which the manga and/or anime series already have a following.&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

Since then he has written numerous bestsellers &#x2014; including THE MULTIVERSITY, JLA, BATMAN and <i>New X-Men</i> &#x2014; as well as the critically acclaimed creator-owned series THE INVISIBLES, SEAGUY, THE FILTH, WE3 and JOE THE BARBARIAN. Morrison has also expanded the borders of the DC Universe in the award-winning pages of SEVEN SOLDIERS, ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, FINAL CRISIS, BATMAN, INC. and ACTION COMICS.<br><br> In his secret identity, Morrison is a &#x201c;counterculture&#x201d; spokesperson, a musician, an award-winning playwright and a chaos magician. He is also the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Supergods</i>, a groundbreaking psycho-historic mapping of the superhero as a cultural organism. He divides his time between his homes in Los Angeles and Scotland.Before writing such critically acclaimed cult comics as <i>The Invisibles</i>, Morrison made his name in 1988 by updating Animal Man, a third-rate 1960s costumed crimefighter. The next year he similarly resuscitated the Doom Patrol, a band of misfit superheroes whose strange powers made society fear and hate them (compare Marvel's X-Men, who debuted at the same time). Morrison's <i>Animal Man</i> drew praise for daring experimentation, but his "World's Strangest Superheroes" raised the stakes by replacing many original cast members with the likes of Crazy Jane, a schizophrenic whose multiple personalities each has its own superpower, and Dorothy Spinner, an ape-faced girl with the ability to distort reality. In this second collection of Morrison's <i>Doom Patrol</i> run, the archvillainous Brotherhood of Evil has been supplanted by the ludicrous but dangerous Brotherhood of Dada. Morrison's outrageously inventive takes on superheroes, which manage to be both smart and silly, may be off-putting to tradition-minded fans. The compensation is that his sensibility draws readers who usually prefer alternative comics. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A published poet and translator of American and English mystery novels, he has been assigned by the Chinese government, under Deng Xiaoping's cadre policy, to a "productive" job with the Special Cases Bureau of the Shanghai Police Department.<p> Shanghai in the mid-1990s is a city caught between reverence for the past and fascination with a tantalizing, market-driven present. When the body of a young "national model worker," revered for her adherence to the principles of the Communist Party, turns up in a canal, Chen is thrown into the midst of these opposing forces. As he struggles to unravel the hidden threads of this paragon's life, he finds himself challenging the very political forces that have guided his life since birth. With party-line-spouting superiors above him and detectives who resent his quick promotion beneath him, Chen finds himself wondering whether justice is a concept at all meaningful in late-20th-century China.</p><p> <i>Death of a Red Heroine</i> is a book hovering uneasily between the spheres of fiction and fact, creativity and didacticism. For much of the novel, author Qiu Xiaolong seems more intent on driving home the actions and consequences of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath than on the slowly unfolding plot. Tedious repetitions of the fates, under Mao, of "educated youths" joust with both the actions of the detectives and Chen's "poetic" ruminations, which, unfortunately, are infected by precisely the stiffness and arbitrariness Qiu is at pains to decry in his historical passages. The moving couplets Chen favors are potentially fascinating insights into the interaction between ancient and modern China, but instead of provoking the reader into reflection, Qiu offers reductive explanations of each and every poem. </p><p> The moments when Qiu concentrates on invoking atmosphere are both illuminating and rewarding: Detective Yu's wife's pride and pleasure in having brought home a dozen crabs at "state price" are movingly well crafted, all the more so because Qiu seems almost unaware of what he is doing. Rather than lecturing on the economic dilemmas of the modern worker, he lets Peiqin's simple happiness speak for itself. In the last quarter of the book, Qiu seems to find his stride, though his writing style remains undeniably awkward. Here Chen expands and relaxes, and with him, the novel. Qiu's debut, though anything but polished, holds the promise of better things to come. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Qiu Xiaolong teaches Chinese Literature at Washington University.</p><h2>St. Paul: A Bible Study Guide for Catholics</h2><p>Immerse yourself in the person of the Apostle Paul--heroic in his martyr's death--but so recognizably human in his conversion story and subsequent letters to the faithful.

Lieutenant Commander Malachi Stormes, the boat&#x2019;s skipper, patrols dangerously close to the minefield entrance and manages to trap and sink three outbound U-boats in one spectacular attack. Britain decorates him, the U.S. Navy promotes him and then gives him command of a brand new class of submarine, a fleet boat called Firefish. Based in Perth, Australia, having been driven out of the Philippines by the Japanese juggernaut, the Perth boats are the only American forces capable of hitting the Japanese in the western Pacific.</p><p>Stormes, with his cold, steely-eyed focus on killing Japanese ships, is an enigma to his officers and crew, especially when it becomes clear that he is willing to take huge chances to achieve results. Firefish sinks more ships than any Perth boat on her first war patrol, but Stormes&#x2019; unconventional tactics literally frighten his crew. Driven by a past steeped in the whiskey-haunted violence of the Kentucky coal fields, whose psychological scars torment his sleep and close him off from personal relationships, Stormes is nicknamed The Iceman. His crew is proud of their boat&#x2019;s accomplishments, but wonder if their iron-willed skipper will bring them home alive.</p><p>With intense action and featuring authentic submarine tactics in the early years of the Pacific war, <i>The Iceman </i>continues P.

After years&#x2019; worth of incompletes, Jess had finally dipped a toe into the core courses of her major&#x2014;leisure studies&#x2014;and decided college was &#x201c;a racket&#x201d; for &#x201c;wretched fucks.&#x201d; Though it was midsemester, she was heading out tomorrow for a tour of the Greek Isles with her wealthy family.<br> <br>Another round of tequila shooters arrived, sent by a trio of frat boys a few tables away. We raised our glasses, then dutifully licked, pounded, and sucked. The tequila, not the boys.<br> <br>While other women might look at these superficially attractive guys and see potential mates or even fun one-night stands, I saw impending headaches. Other girls got hot and bothered by their lines and pickups; I just got bothered.<br> <br>But I hadn&#x2019;t always been that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do the frat boys, Nat!&#x201d; our friend Polly cried. She was a sturdy corn-fed Nebraska girl&#x2014;her family&#x2019;s farm was in a small town outside Lincoln, just a few miles away from ours. Well, not ours anymore, since Mom had sold out last year.<br> <br>&#x201c;Too easy,&#x201d; I said, having already sized up the trio. The first guy had been constantly checking sports scores on TV while his leg jogged. The second was a bleary mess whose own friends rolled their eyes at his drunkenness. The third one&#x2019;s grooming and clothing were fanatically perfect, and he kept checking his appearance in the mirror behind the bar.<br> <br>&#x201c;From left to right, then?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Inveterate gambler, habitual drunk, and&#x2014;how should I put this?&#x2014;the third is ill-equipped.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed. Yep, those guys were too easy to read. Where was the excitement? Here I was at the same Lincoln bar I always went to, with the same crowd I always hung around. I had an early work shift tomorrow at one restaurant, a late one at the other, and classes to take and to teach on Monday. I&#x2019;d been averaging five hours of sleep a night for the last few weeks. What was I even doing here?<br> <br>I guessed I could sleep when I was dead.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve chosen my quarry for the evening,&#x201d; beautiful Jess said. &#x201c;Ill-equipped is mine.&#x201d; As per her usual, she would pick up another conquest and take him back to his place&#x2014;so she could leave when finished with him. &#x201c;His type,&#x201d; she continued blithely, &#x201c;usually make up for any shortcomings with their mouths. True story.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told her, &#x201c;And you better be careful, Jessebel, or else you&#x2019;ll collect another admirer who clings like lichen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it that this is the Bermuda Triangle&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed at her crotch&#x2014;&#x201c;when guys venture there, they tend to stay.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tapped my chin. &#x201c;Oh, I thought you called it that because it&#x2019;s sucked in lots of seamen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Between guffaws, she said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a completely fair statement!&#x201d;<br> <br>We could laugh about it now, but I&#x2019;d lived with the aftermath of her affairs: the desperate gifts, the late-night phone calls, the stalking.<br> <br>What was the point of all the drama? Of all that angst? Dating, love, and sex were all overrated&#x2014;as I&#x2019;d repeatedly tried to explain to Jess. She would get this secretive smile and say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna get blindsided one day. I only hope I&#x2019;m there to see it. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>When the laughter died down, Polly said, &#x201c;Do him,&#x201d; with a wave at the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Exhaling with boredom&#x2014;earn your booze, carny&#x2014;I turned toward the entrance. And saw the baddest-looking man I&#x2019;d ever encountered.<br> <br>His eyes were a vivid gold, stark against his thick black hair. He wore it longish, the ends brushing his collar. He had a roman nose that had likely been broken and a razor-thin scar that sliced down across both lips. A fighter?<br> <br>Yet that didn&#x2019;t fit with his expensive clothing: a tailored black coat and dress shirt, dark gray slacks, black leather shoes and belt. Through Jess, I&#x2019;d learned enough about fashion to recognize fine threads. His outfit probably cost more than my entire wardrobe.<br> <br>When he stood at the bar and ordered a drink, I saw that he had three rings on one hand, a ring on his other thumb, and a wicked-looking tattoo peeking out from his starch-stiff collar. His style was a mix of privileged and street.<br> <br>He was tall, with a lean, muscular build, and looked maybe twenty-nine or thirty, but his face was weary, as an older man&#x2019;s would be. With those rough-hewn features, he was ruggedly handsome, yet not classically so.<br> <br>There was an aura of ennui about him, but he also seemed hyper-alert. What the hell? My internal manalyzer whirred with confusion. Does not compute!<br> <br>I could feel my friends staring at me, but I was at a loss. &#x201c;I . . . I got nothing.&#x201d; Was he a brawler or a rich playboy or both? I was also sensing top notes of European&#x2014;along with strong undertones of dangerous!<br> <br>He was like a history book written in a script I&#x2019;d never seen. Fascinating.<br> <br>Jess pinched my side, drawing my attention to her smug grin. &#x201c;You can close your mouth now, hooker.&#x201d; In a patronizing tone, she said, &#x201c;Welcome to my world&#x2014;where first meetings are always in slo-mo and the song &#x2018;At Last&#x2019; repeats on a loop.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, no, her world was angsty and overwrought. So why had my gaze darted back to the man?<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one hot piece of tackle&#x2014;in a cage-fighter/GQ model mash-up kind of way.&#x201d; Jess wasn&#x2019;t going to let this go. &#x201c;Probably gets more ass than a toilet seat. But he got you to look twice, which makes him a rare and wondrous creature, this bar&#x2019;s very own unicorn. Requires closer investigation, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could question him, type him, then discard all thoughts of him. I was just tipsy enough to consider it. &#x201c;I should go up and introduce myself?&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded. &#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;re a twat. Now, go forth with confidence, for you look cute-iful tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jess&#x2019;s style was SEXY GLAM! Mine? See-me-love-me, motherfleckers. Yet tonight, I was wearing a hip-hugging suede skirt and a slinky red top&#x2014;one of Jess&#x2019;s fashion-forward, low-cut numbers. For once, my bra wasn&#x2019;t a minimizer.<br> <br>This outfit had come about because the clothes I&#x2019;d normally wear&#x2014;jeans and a turtleneck&#x2014;were all in an overflowing laundry hamper. I&#x2019;d worn the black knee-high boots Jess had bought me, to show appreciation in front of her.<br> <br>I rose, smoothed my wavy hair over my shoulder, then tugged down my skirt, prompting Jess to give me a loud slap on the ass for encouragement. As I passed their table, Ill-Equipped and Habitual Drunk raised their glasses to me, which didn&#x2019;t hurt my confidence.<br> <br>Once I was halfway over to Badass, his eyes locked on me. His gaze grew heated, and immediately the area felt smaller, warmer. I squelched the urge to fan myself. For the first time in my life, I was a little . . . giddy.<br> <br>When I sidled up to him at the bar, he turned fully to me. Up close, he was even more intimidating, even more attractive. Taller than I&#x2019;d thought.<br> <br>His spellbinding eyes were the color of amber, irises ringed with black.<br> <br>As I noted additional details&#x2014;scarred knuckles, tattoos on his fingers under those rings, chiseled jawline clean-shaven&#x2014;I perceived the heat coming off his big body. Then I got my first mind-numbing hit of his scent.<br> <br>Crisp, masculine, intoxicating.<br> <br>Blindsiding.<br> <br>Speak, Nat. I had to look up to face him. &#x201c;Uh, hi, I&#x2019;m Natalie.&#x201d; I offered him my hand to shake. He didn&#x2019;t take it. Okay . . . I swallowed. &#x201c;Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d; Was that a vodka rocks he&#x2019;d ordered? He didn&#x2019;t look like a 7&amp;7 type of guy.<br> <br>He canted his head, studying my face&#x2014;the same way I studied men&#x2019;s expressions. Still he said nothing. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t speak the language. UNL had a lot of overseas students. &#x201c;Drink?&#x201d; I pointed to his untouched glass and mimed a shot.<br> <br>His expression gave away so little, it was like I was talking to a wall.<br> <br>As my cheeks flushed, I muttered, &#x201c;Sooo, this went well. Good talk, buddy.&#x201d; With a mortified smile, I turned around&#x2014;<br> <br>A callused palm closed around my elbow, his rings cool compared to his skin. The contact was so electric, I shivered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; he said. Had there been a subtle v sound to that w?<br> <br>My heart leapt&#x2014;maybe he was . . . Russian. I turned around, a genuine smile on my face now. &#x201c;Are you from Russia?&#x201d; I added, &#x201c;Zdrav-stvooi-tee.&#x201d; ?Hello.<br> <br>He still cupped my elbow. How could his hand be so hot? I stifled imaginings of him cupping other parts of me, those hands spreading heat in their wake. . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;You speak my language, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bingo, a Russian! &#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; I said with delight. I could grill him about the country, learning more about my birthplace! &#x201c;I took a class or two.&#x201d; Or five. My master&#x2019;s had required fluency in a second language, and I&#x2019;d chosen Russian.<br> <br>He swept his glance around, his stance alert, as if someone might throw a punch at any second. Then he met my gaze once more. &#x201c;Of all the men in this bar, you choose me to approach?&#x201d; His English was very good, though heavily accented. &#x201c;Are you looking for trouble?&#x201d;<br> <br>With a confidence I didn&#x2019;t feel, I teasingly said, &#x201c;Maybe I am.&#x201d; I sounded breathy&#x2014;I still hadn&#x2019;t caught my breath since he&#x2019;d first touched me. &#x201c;Have I found it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He glanced down, seeming surprised that he was still holding my arm. He abruptly released me, growing angrier by the second. &#x201c;No, little girl. You have not.&#x201d; With a disgusted look, he turned away and stalked out.<br> <br>I stared at the door, battling my bewilderment. What just happened? I&#x2019;d seen interest in his gaze, hadn&#x2019;t I?<br> <br>Yet then he&#x2019;d acted like a vampire who&#x2019;d discovered I was a fucking sunbeam.</p><h2>The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p><b>From the acclaimed authors of <i>A Future Perfect</i> comes the untold story of how the company became the world&#x2019;s most powerful institution.</b><br><br>Like all groundbreaking books, <i>The Company</i> fills a hole we didn&#x2019;t know existed, revealing that we cannot make sense of the past four hundred years until we place that seemingly humble Victorian innovation, the joint-stock company, in the center of the frame. <br><br>With their trademark authority and wit, <i>Economist</i> editors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge reveal the company to be one of history&#x2019;s great catalysts, for good and for ill, a mighty engine for sucking in, recombining, and pumping out money, goods, people, and culture to every corner of the globe. What other earthly invention has the power to grow to any size, and to live to any age? What else could have given us both the stock market and the British Empire? The company man, the company town, and company time? Disneyfication and McDonald&#x2019;sization, to say nothing of Coca-colonialism? Through its many mutations, the company has always incited controversy, and governments have always fought to rein it in. Today, though Marx may spin in his grave and anarchists riot in the streets, the company exercises an unparalleled influence on the globe, and understanding what this creature is and where it comes from has never been a more pressing matter.

A.C.S. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes</h2><p><b>A leading naturalist and writer travels the globe in search of a prized-and vanishing-bird</b><br><br>Cranes are ubiquitous in the earliest legends of the world's peoples, where they often figure as harbingers of heaven and omens of longevity and good fortune. They are still held sacred in many places, and for good reason. Their large size and need for wilderness habitat makes them an "umbrella species" whose wellbeing assures that of other creatures and of the ecosystem at large. Moreover, the enormous spans of their migrations are a symbol of, and stimulus to, international efforts at conservation. <br><br>In <i>The Birds of Heaven</i>, Peter Matthiessen has woven together journeys in search of the fifteen species of cranes in Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Australia. As he tracks them (and their declining numbers) in the company of scientists, conservationists, and regional people encountered along the way, he captures the dilemmas of a planet in ecological crisis, and the deeper loss to humankind if these beautiful and imposing creatures are allowed to disappear. The book includes color plates by renowned wildlife artist Robert Bateman.<br></p><p>Acclaimed writer Peter Matthiessen, a self-professed "craniac," has been observing and studying all kinds of birds most of his life, but his pursuit of cranes is closer to a spiritual quest than a naturalist's exercise. These majestic, mythic, and notoriously shy birds, capable of soaring at heights of 20,000 feet, are often fond of remote and rugged places, so just locating the birds can be difficult enough, determining an accurate number often impossible. Some locales, such as the breeding grounds on the Platte River in Nebraska, boast flocks half a million strong--"by far the greatest crane assemblies on earth"; other areas support only a precious few. Matthiessen's search for 15 different species of cranes has taken him to hidden corners of Siberia, China, Mongolia, Tibet, Sudan, and Australia (where Atherton cranes were not even discovered until 1961). Despite his many years of adventure and wide travels, each crane sighting is still a thrill for him, and his curiosity and contagious enthusiasm bring the book alive. But <i>The Birds of Heaven</i> also serves as an ecological warning: "Perhaps more than any other living creatures, they evoke the retreating wilderness, the vanishing horizons of clean water, earth, and air upon which their species--and ours, too, though we learn it very late--must ultimately depend for survival." <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i><b>Peter Matthiessen</b> is a naturalist and explorer whose many works of nonfiction include <i>The Tree Where Man Was Born</i>, which was nominated for a National Book Award and <i>The Snow Leopard</i>, which won it.

She is a member of the board of directors of the Council for Spiritual and Ethical Education.<p><b>Chapter 2: The Blessing of Acceptance:</b> </p><p> <i>Discovering Your Unique and Ordinary Child</i> </p><p> I recently read a third-grade school newsletter that used the word <i>special</i> five times on two pages. The Thanksgiving Sing was special. So was the Spellathon. The Emerging Artists exhibition was special. Even the unassuming Pie Drive was, for reasons not clearly revealed by the newsletter coverage, special indeed. And, finally, this year's third-grade class was in itself a very, very special group. </p><p> I wondered, Is it possible? So much specialness concentrated in one place? A cosmic coincidence? Or was this really an extraordinary school with unusually dazzling children, committed teachers, generous and energetic families? In fact, this school is a fine and good one. The children are intelligent and well behaved, the teachers care, the parents give of their time and money. But it is not a terribly unusual school, and I questioned the benefit of believing otherwise. </p><p> The third-grade newsletter was not unique. At nearly every campus I visit, the staff, the posters on the walls, and the overall atmosphere emphasize that this is not merely a place of learning, it's a breeding ground for enlightened, compassionate champions. The schools are not to blame for their hubris. Parents, with their grand expectations for their children, have sparked the outbreak of specialness. </p><p> My friend Paula, who runs a terrific elementary school, told of taking a mother on a prospective parents' tour of the campus. The mom said that her daughter Sloane had a strong interest in science. "At another school I visited, the kindergarten teachers put streamers in the trees to demonstrate the properties of wind to the students," she reported. "I'm hoping you would do that here too. I wouldn't want Sloaner to miss out." </p><p> "We have leaves on our trees," Paula responded. "They do the same thing. Can't guarantee we'll be using streamers." Sloane's mother sent her daughter to the school with the streamers. </p><p> The principal of another school complained to me about his frustration with parents' expectations: </p><p> Too many parents want everything fixed by the time their child is eight. They want academic perfection, a child as capable as any other child in the Western hemisphere. Children develop in fits and starts, but nobody has time for that anymore. No late bloomers, no slow starters, nothing unusual accepted! If a child doesn't get straight A's, his parents start fretting that he's got a learning disability or a motivation problem. The normal curve has disappeared. Parents seem to think that children only come in two flavors: learning disabled and gifted. Not every child has unlimited potential in all areas. This doesn't mean most kids won't be able to go to college and to compete successfully in the adult world. Almost all of them will. Parents just need to relax a little and be patient. </p><p> What's going on here? Why does the newsletter shout hosannas? Why is Sloane's mother so anxious for her daughter to experience a miniature physics lab in kindergarten? Why can't parents let their eight-year-olds develop at a natural, raggedy pace? </p><p> When I began studying Judaism, one of the first things that struck me was how directly it spoke to the issue of parental pressure. According to Jewish thought, parents should not expect their children to be anyone other than who they are. A Hasidic teaching says, "If your child has a talent to be a baker, don't tell him to be a doctor." Judaism holds that every child is made in the divine image. When we ignore a child's intrinsic strengths in an effort to push him toward our notion of extraordinary achievement, we are undermining God's plan. </p><p> If the pressure to be special gets too intense, children end up in the therapist's office suffering from sleep and eating disorders, chronic stomachaches, hair-pulling, depression, and other ailments. They are casualties of their parents' drive for perfection. It was children such as these who spurred me to look outside standard therapeutic practices for ways to help. In Judaism I found an approach that respects children's uniqueness while accepting them in all their ordinary glory. <br> </p><p> MISSION: PERFECTION </p><p> In Chapter 1 I described my surprise and confusion when, after conducting tests and telling parents that their child was "within normal limits," the parents were frequently disappointed. In their view, a diagnosable problem was better than a normal, natural limitation. A problem can be fixed, but a true limitation requires adjustment of expectations and acceptance of an imperfect son or daughter. Parents feel hope if their restless child is actually hyperactive, their dreamy child has ADD, their poor math student has a learning disorder, their shy child has a social phobia, their wrongdoing son has "intermittent explosive disorder." If there is a diagnosis, specialists and tutors can be hired, drugs given, treatment plans made, and parents can maintain an illusion that the imperfection can be overcome. Their faith in their child's unlimited potential is restored. </p><p> Why are parents so anxious to be raising perfect children? The answer is twofold: pride and fear of the future. </p><p> <br> <i>My Child, My Masterpiece</i> </p><p> Janet asked for advice from me and the other members of our parenting class about how to "talk sense" to her older son. </p><p> Do you know about the Johns Hopkins Talent Search? They offer sixth graders the chance to take the SAT. If a student scores in the same range as the average twelfth grader on either verbal or math he qualifies for a special summer academic program on a college campus. I know that Dylan would qualify in math but he says he doesn't want to sit for the test. This is crazy because the school wouldn't even know his score and if he makes it and enters the talent search program it would look great on his transcript. </p><p> Laypeople call it bragging; psychologists describe it as "achievement by proxy syndrome." Some parents use their children's achievements for their own sense of security, personal glory, or the fulfillment of unfulfilled dreams. Even parents who don't use their children as a hedge against existential fears or a badge of their own worth can find it hard not to succumb to the fever of competition. </p><p> It wasn't always this way. In the past, parents produced children for their work value (hands to labor on the farm). Today many parents see their children's achievement as an important family "product." This attitude leads to an upside-down, child-centered perspective where we cater to children's whims yet pressure them to achieve at all costs -- academically, socially, and athletically. But this pressure can backfire. </p><p> Children who feel that they are expected to surpass their parents' already high level of achievement or to demonstrate skills that are beyond their capabilities will suffer. Some children are one-trick ponies, and trying to get them to master a broad variety of skills is futile and destructive. Keep at it, and they'll even forget their one trick. Other children begin to feel as if they are working only for their parents' satisfaction, and they openly rebel. Some respond to the pressure by losing their intrinsic enjoyment of mastering skills, and still others use psychosomatic symptoms to get out of the running. By exaggerating their defects, these children hope to avoid failure and to have their progress measured by more individual, realistic standards. </p><p> Your child is not your masterpiece. According to Jewish thought, your child is not even truly "yours." In Hebrew there is no verb for possession; the expression we translate as "to have," <i>yesh li,</i> actually means "it is there for me" or "there is for me." Although nothing belongs to us, God has made everything available on loan and has invited us to borrow it to further the purpose of holiness. This includes our children. They are a precious loan, and each one has a unique path toward serving God. Our job is to help them find out what it is. </p><p> <br> <i>Conquering the Future with Brave Little Generalists</i> </p><p> If children were required to excel only in certain areas, they might be better able to cope with their parents' expectations. Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we make unfairly "generic" demands on our adolescents: "It is the only period in your life when you're expected to do all things well. Adults don't hold themselves to those standards. We don't interview the pediatrician about whether he can throw a basketball, or quiz our accountant on biology before we let her do our taxes. In elementary and high school we celebrate the generalist, but in the real world there is no room for the generalist except on Jeopardy!" </p><p> The age at which we expect children to become very good at everything is getting lower. Part of the reason for this is parents' fears of an uncertain future, one that is hurtling at us more quickly than ever before. The computer bought today can be replaced by a cheaper, lighter, snappier-looking one with a faster modem by the time we get it out of the box. Parents worry that in this hyperpaced world, only the child who excels at everything will survive. If young Maya can't design her own Web site, stay at the very top of her class, run a marathon, and speak confidently before large groups, she'll be left in the dust. </p><p> Our attempts to prepare our children for the future are limited by our own imaginations of what the future will be like. We're apprehensive, but our children are not. The high-tech, rapidly changing world that seems so mind-bending to us is normal to them. "Preparing" our children for this new world by turning them into supercompetitive generalists is useless because we can't second-guess the skills they will need twenty years from now. The only things that are certain to be valuable are character traits such as honesty, tenacity, flexibility, optimism, and compassion -- the same traits that have served people well for centuries. </p><p> <br> <i>Fear of the Ordinary: Lake Wobegon Parenting</i> </p><p> Remember Lake Wobegon, the fictional town created by Garrison Keillor, where "all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average"? That sunny, statistics-defying state of mind is familiar turf for elementary school teachers. They describe hearing the same song every year when it's time for parent conferences. One weary middle school director told me, </p><p> Parents are so nervous. If their child is doing well in everything it's like a badge for them that everything is OK. If their child is, God forbid, average, they panic. That's why so many teachers have started giving "Lake Wobegon" report cards. Teachers are afraid that if they give anything less than an A, parents will blame their child's poor achievement on the teacher's lack of skill rather than on the child's limitations. This is a shame, because real problems get glossed over or missed until fourth grade, when there's no more hiding it and the child's weaker areas show up on standardized tests. </p><p> Some parents can maintain the specialness myth with their children long past fourth grade. Is this good for the child's self-esteem? Listen to Isabel, a student I interviewed at an elite private school. Isabel will be entering the eleventh grade next year. She told me that she was having a hard time socially. The last two boys she wanted to have as boyfriends hadn't been interested in her. Her teachers seemed to favor other students. She felt confused and hurt: </p><p> I know why this is so hard for me. My mom and dad always, always made me feel like I was the best: the most beautiful, the smartest, the most charming. And mostly I've done well in everything. But, now I'm finding out that I'm not that unusual. Maybe I'm good enough, but I don't know anymore. </p><p> Like so many parents, Isabel's mother and father were afraid their daughter would think she was ordinary. Whether they were also reluctant to admit to themselves that their child was "merely" average, I don't know. But their Lake Wobegon attitude has not benefited Isabel. They've put her on a pedestal and now she's stuck up there, unable to find out what level she would reach if she had a chance to bob around with everybody else. </p><p> <br> <i>Boys and Girls: Equal but Different</i> </p><p> There is another aspect of contemporary child-rearing that places still more pressure on our children. Over the past twenty years, teachers and social scientists have downplayed the differences between boys and girls. It's been done as a corrective to a history of inequality, but the result is that we've come to expect boys to behave like girls and girls like boys in circumstances where this is difficult for them. There's no question that all children should be encouraged to pursue whatever field interests them, but a gender-blind approach can sometimes increase the stress on our overstressed kids. Gone are the gender-based safe havens of the past; now both sexes have the opportunity -- the obligation -- to excel in every arena, from academics to sports, from being a good listener to being a leader. </p><p> God is the original maker of distinctions: light from darkness, the seventh day of rest from the six days of labor, sacred from profane. While remaining aware of the potential for discrimination, we can also remain respectful of innate distinctions between boys and girls. For example, their interests and developmental stages are often different. Instead of trying to ignore or flatten these differences, we can pay attention to the ways they are revealed in our children's behavior. If you fear that acknowledging any gender differences will lead to unfair treatment, your children may miss out on getting what they need. In order to treat our daughters and sons fairly it is sometimes necessary to treat them differently. Honoring distinctions can lead to equal opportunity. </p><p> <br> <i>Inappropriate Expectations of Boys</i> </p><p> Laurie's son, Noah, was born when her daughter, Rachel, was four. "I was amazed at the differences from the start," she said. "When Noah was a baby he shouted 'Ball!' whenever he saw the letter O. He insisted that I walk on the trafficky side of the street instead of the lovely tree-lined residential side so he could see the trucks up close. He called out to every one, 'Rrruuum! Rrruuum!'" </p><p> Noah concentrated so hard that he could do only one thing at a time. If Laurie wanted him to listen to her, she had to hold his three-year-old face in her hands. She couldn't take him with her on errands because he'd run away. Laurie and her husband, Mark, decided that they would never allow Noah to have toy guns or to watch TV, only educational videos. That didn't stop Noah from shooting at everything -- he'd just cock his finger or make a gun out of his toast or a graham cracker. </p><p> What will happen when this truck-loving, hyperfocused, shoot-'em-up guy gets to kindergarten? When he has to sit still at a table for a chunk of the day and practice printing upper- and lowercase letters? When he has to cooperate nicely <i>all day long?</i> When no fart noises or finger guns are permitted? ("Noah, I know you remember how to use your words, right, Noah?") </p><p> Here's what his teacher might tell Laurie: "Noah h...</p></p><h2>Fabric Art Collage: 40+ Mixed Media Techniques</h2><p>Everything you ever wanted to know about mixed-media fabric collage.

His son, Leto Atreides II, sees the path that his father Muad&#39;Dib had also seen, a future that secures the continuation of human life throughout the universe. That future, however, requires an aberrant act of selflessness: becoming a hybrid of man and sandworm. At the end of Children of Dune, Leto II accepts this mantle of godhead from the Fremen and transforms himself into a monster of the desert, a sandworm, that will dominate the ecology of the planet Arrakis (known as Dune) for millennia. This is an act his father had been unwilling to do. Leto essentially accepts the terrible price of saving humanity which his father had rejected. God Emperor of Dune chronicles Leto&#39;s attempts to consummate the Golden Path, which delivers the volition of humanity by scattering it beyond the perceived safety of the Imperium&#39;s known universe, and also by destroying the possibility of the Imperium&#39;s control by any single entity, including himself.</p><p></p><h2>Eerdmans Handbook to the Bible</h2><p>Authoritative, factual, and accessible, this fully-illustrated reference volume, prepared by a team of leading biblical scholars, offers a comprehensive, section-by-section guide to the Bible, with notes on difficult areas, and numerous background articles on the Bible.

Only the day before, he had received an urgent message from the Russian embassy in Havana that his friend Pribluda was missing and asking that he come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Cubans insisted that this corpse floating in an inner tube was Pribluda, but Arkady wasn't so sure. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> "You don't investigate assault, you don't investigate murder. Just what do you investigate?" Arkady asks Ofelia Osorio, a detective in the Polic�a Nacional de la Revoluci�n. "Or is it simply open season on Russians in Havana?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The comrades of the Cold War have parted bitterly, and the Russians who used to swarm through Havana's streets are now as rare as they are despised, much more so than Americans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Havana is overrun with color, music, and suspicion. The Revolution's heroes have outlived idealism. The Com-munist world has shrunk to Cuba. Paradise has become a stop on sex tours. It is a city of empty stores and talking drums, Karl Marx and sharp machetes, where an American radical rides around in Hemingway's car to tout island investments and a Wall Street developer on the run from the FBI flies a pirate flag.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"A dead Russian, a live Russian," Ofelia says. "What's the difference?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But the dead Russian is followed by the murders of a Cuban boxer and a prostitute. Although none of them is supposed to be investigated, Arkady cannot be stopped. He speaks no Spanish, knows nothing about Cuba, and, as a Russian, is a pariah. However, there is something about this faded, lovely, dangerous city--the rhythms of waves against the seawall, the insinuation of music always in the air, and, finally, Ofelia herself--that plunges Arkady back into life.<br><br>"What ultimately sets the Renko books apart is the careful writing, and, more important, the knowledge of the human heart that is carried through it, through them, first to last."<br>--Chicago Tribune</p><p>In this fourth book in Martin Cruz Smith's splendid series, an amiable Irish American gangster explains to Arkady Renko what he and the other 84 wanted Americans hiding out in Cuba do with themselves. "We try to stay alive. Useful. Tell me, Arkady, what are <i>you</i> doing here?" "The same," says Renko--and it's true. His life as a Russian cop has become so bleak and lonely that he takes any opportunity to shake things up, even spending his own savings to fly to Havana when an old colleague is found dead--floating inside an inner tube after night-fishing in Havana Bay. Renko sets out to make himself useful in this shabby, fascinating, haunted country whose inhabitants look on Russians with the cold disdain of survivors of a nasty divorce.<p> As he did so well in <i>Gorky Park</i>, Smith again makes Renko very much a classic Russian hero in temperament and tradition, but also the eternal outsider. He is at times close to the edge of despair--but his trip to Havana restores his natural curiosity and life force.</p><p> In this hot Havana, ripe with the fruity smell of sex, Renko keeps his Moscow overcoat on--until an equally idealistic and out-of-place young female cop gets him to loosen up. There's an unusually complex plot, even for the sly strand-spinner Smith. He raises baffling questions: Why would a group of military plotters order illegal lobsters in a fancy restaurant and then not eat them? And his descriptions of Cuban life are dead-on, reminding us on every page what a superb stylist he is. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>10 cds</p><h2>Lonely Planet Greece (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s leading travel guide publisher</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet <i>Greece </i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

His shoulders were relaxed, his hands loose, warm, and ready inside thin leather gloves. He could feel his heart beat a slow, steady cadence, feel the adrenaline shooting so high he could fly. His breath puffed white in the frigid morning air, not unexpected on an early January morning in London. There was nothing like a hostage situation to get one&#x2019;s blood pumping, and he was ready. </p><p>He took in the scene as he&#x2019;d been trained to do, complemented by years of experience: shooters positioned on the roofs in a three-block triangular radius, sirens wailing behind shouts and screams, and a single semiautomatic weapon bursting out an occasional staccato drumbeat. The streets were shut down in all directions. A helicopter&#x2019;s rotors whumped overhead. His team was lined up be�hind him, waiting for the go signal. </p><p>His suspect was thirty yards away, tucked out of sight, ten feet from the left of the entrance to the Victoria Street Underground, and not shy about letting them know his position. He&#x2019;d been told the guy was a nutter&#x2014;not a surprise, given he&#x2019;d been wild-eyed in his demands for money from a second-rate kiosk at dawn. Instead of making a run for it, he&#x2019;d grabbed a woman and was now holed up, shooting away. Where he had found a semiautomatic weapon, plus enough ammunition to take out Khartoum, Nicholas didn&#x2019;t know. He didn&#x2019;t care about the answer, only wanted this to end peaceably. </p><p>At least the hostage hadn&#x2019;t been killed yet. She was a middle-aged woman, now lying on her side maybe six feet from the shooter, trussed up with duct tape. They could see her face, leached of color and terrified. He could imagine her screams of terror if her mouth weren&#x2019;t taped. </p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t dead. Yet. Which presented a problem&#x2014;one wrong move and a bullet would go into her head. </p><p>Nicholas glanced over his shoulder at his second, Detective In�spector Gareth Scott, tucked against the curb, his expression edgy, a flash of excitement in his eyes. He clutched his Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 against his chest. His Glock 17 was in its shoulder holster. </p><p>The suspect stopped firing his weapon, and there was sudden blessed silence. Nicholas didn&#x2019;t think the guy had run out of bul�lets. Had the gun jammed? They should be so lucky. What was he thinking? Planning? </p><p>Nicholas dropped down beside Gareth. &#x201c;We have ourselves a crazy. Brief me on the rest.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We have a photo, taken from the eastern rooftop. It&#x2019;s blurred, but Facial Recognition did their magic. The guy&#x2019;s name is Es�posito, out of prison only a month. I guess he woke up real early and decided he needed some excitement in his life and went on this little rampage.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What set him off?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know. He took four quid out of the kiosk till, all the guy had at this hour of the morning, and grabbed the woman when the police showed up.&#x201d; </p><p>Esposito raised his weapon again and blasted half a dozen bul�lets into the foggy morning air. </p><p>Nicholas saw a brief glimpse of the man&#x2019;s head, but the angle made it impossible for the snipers to take him out. He wouldn&#x2019;t give them permission to fire anyway, not if there was a chance of hitting the woman. He had to make a decision&#x2014;time was run�ning short. </p><p>Nicholas glanced at his watch. 5:16 a.m., an ungodly hour in winter, barely light enough to see. At least it wasn&#x2019;t raining, but clouds were fat and black overhead. All they needed to make this a real party. </p><p>Esposito continued shooting, then stopped mid-blast and shouted, &#x201c;You stupid coppers back off or she&#x2019;s dead, you hear me? I&#x2019;ll let her go as soon as I&#x2019;m clear!&#x201d; </p><p>There was return gunfire, and Esposito screamed, &#x201c;Shoot at me again and I swear I&#x2019;ll kill her. Back off. Back off!&#x201d; </p><p>Nicholas shouted, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll back off. Don&#x2019;t hurt the woman.&#x201d; </p><p>Esposito&#x2019;s answer was a bullet that flew a couple of feet over Nicholas&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; Nicholas said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You want him alive?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; Nicholas said. &#x201c;We need a better angle. Follow me.&#x201d; </p><p>They duck-walked across the street, then flattened, faces to the ground, just before fusillade of bullets kicked up gravel two feet away from their earlier position. Gareth cursed. &#x201c;At least the guy&#x2019;s a lousy shot.&#x201d; </p><p>Silence again, except for their fast breaths. Nicholas didn&#x2019;t think Esposito had seen them move. &#x201c;Keep still and stay down,&#x201d; he whis�pered. They were only twenty yards downwind now, sheltered by the construction in front of the station&#x2019;s fa�ade. A good spot, though if Esposito moved, turned, he might very well see them and they&#x2019;d be dead. </p><p>Almost as if he knew what they were doing, Esposito grabbed the woman, held her in front of him as a shield and dragged her fifteen feet before pulling her down behind a big metal construc�tion bin. Now Esposito was facing away from them, a good thirty feet from their position. He was squatted down behind the bin, leaning around the side to check for threats, ready to fire. </p><p>And Nicholas thought, This is surely a gift from the Almighty. He was staring at the bottom of the construction bin. Its base was at least three inches off the ground. He smiled as he smoothly rolled onto his belly and pulled his Glock 17 from his shoulder holster. He aimed at those three precious inches on the underside of the bin, sighting carefully. The guy had big feet in shiny white Nikes, a bull&#x2019;s-eye target if there ever was one. </p><p>Nicholas squeezed the trigger. The man yelped and hopped away from the bin, stumbled, and went down hard on the&nbsp; pavement. </p><p>&#x201c;Take him now!&#x201d; Nicholas yelled into his shoulder radio. He jumped to his feet as he spoke. &#x201c;And do mind his weapon, people.&#x201d; </p><p>His team rushed to surround Esposito, who&#x2019;d fallen five feet from his hiding place behind the bin. He saw them running at him and slammed his weapon to the ground, threw his arms up in surrender, and the standoff was over. And no one was dead, or even badly hurt. </p><p>A metallic horn rang out signaling the engagement was over. </p><p>Gareth clapped his boss on the shoulder. &#x201c;Nice one,&#x201d; he said, then called out, &#x201c;A-Team, to me.&#x201d; </p><p>A smattering of applause made Nicholas turn, but before he could holster his Glock, a voice boomed over the loudspeaker. &#x201c;Detective Chief Inspector Drummond. You have broken the rules of engagement, and are hereby disqualified. Report to me immediately.&#x201d; </p><p><br></p></p><h2>Blood, Bread, and Roses: How Menstruation Created the World</h2><p>The feminist author of Another Mother Tongue offers a mythographic study of the interconnections among ancient menstrual rites and the development of agriculture, mathematics, writing, calendars, and other realms of knowledge.</p><p>Judy Grahn, a poet, is author of &#34;Another Mother Tongue,&#34; &#34;The Queen of Wands,&#34; and &#34;The Queen of Swords,&#34; among others.In native and prehistoric cultures around the world, a menstruating woman carried out rituals in which she was secluded--not allowed to see light--but emerged triumphantly at the end of her period. Grahn ( Another Mother Tongue ) believes these rites taught women principles of separation and synchronic relationship (reinforced by women's awareness that the menstrual cycle was in rhythm with the moon's phases). This "menstrual logic," she adds, was transmitted to men, who extended it. Stretching the evidence thin to fit her theory, Grahn uses menstrual ritual and "menstrual consciousness" to explain the orignis of mathematics, astronomy, marriage rites (the bride's dress in Europe was once red), cosmetics, cooking and mourning customs. Her intriguing excursion through folklore, myth, religion, anthropology and history bespeaks a feminist conviction that male origin stories must be balanced by a recognition of women's central role in shaping civilization. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The London Ritz Book of Afternoon Tea</h2><p><p>Afternoon tea is the english meal-time institution, a social as well as a culinary event.</p><p>It is precisely this atmosphere which is embodied in the Palm Court Tearoom at the Ritz in London, which for many years has been one of the most delightful and traditional places to take tea.</p><p><em>The London Ritz Book of Afternoon Tea</em> captures the essence of this traditional British occasion and provides the reader with all the Ritz expertize in the ceremony as well as over 50 recipes, illustrated with passages from Dickens to Oscar Wilde and charming drawings.</p></p><p><p>After five years at Oxford, where she gained a M.

And there is never an ordinary day when you&#x2019;ve got a best friend like Lena.</b><br><br>Hardly a day passes without Trille and Lena inventing some kind of adventure that often ends in trouble. Whether it&#x2019;s coaxing a cow onto a boat or sledding down the steepest and iciest hill with a chicken, there is always a thrill&#x2014;and sometimes an injury&#x2014;to be had. Trille loves to share everything with Lena, even Auntie Granny&#x2019;s waffles. But when Lena has to move away and Auntie Granny leaves the world, it sometimes seems like nothing will ever be right again. The warmth of friendship and the support of family suffuse this lightly illustrated novel, proving that when times are tough, a little taste of sweetness can make all the difference.</p><p><b>Maria Parr</b> is a writer and high-school teacher. <i>Adventures with Waffles,</i> her debut novel, has been translated into twenty languages and won several awards around the world. Maria Parr lives in Norway with her family.<br><br><b>Guy Puzey</b> began translating Norwegian literature after studying the language at the University of Edinburgh and now works at the university as a researcher and teacher.Gr 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;In this delightful Norwegian import, two friends, a boy nicknamed Trille and his best friend, Lena, get into some hair-raising, frequently hilarious, and, sometimes, injury-inducing escapades over the course of a year. Narrated by Trille in a realistically childlike, first-person voice, the novel is fresh and fast-paced. While readers will chuckle at the friends' adventures&#x2014;and marvel at their chutzpah&#x2014;their mouths will also water at the frequency with which waffles, clearly a popular Norwegian treat, figure into the story. Children will relate to Trille's anxiety about whether he is Lena's best pal, a worry extinguished in a final, harrowing episode that, fortunately, ends well. Silhouettes, featured on the charming cover, also highlight chapter openings and provide a cozy, friendly feel. Readers may occasionally be put off by Lena's portrayal as too proud, stubborn, and reckless for her own good, but they'll appreciate her resourcefulness and strength of character anyway. Purchasers should note some religious overtones and Christian references.

But she was beginning to feel a sense of longing for a family and for home. When she interviewed a dynamic young farmer, her world changed. Kristin knew nothing about growing vegetables, let alone raising pigs and cattle and driving horses. But on an impulse, smitten, if not yet in love, she shed her city self and moved to five hundred acres near Lake Champlain to start a new farm with him. <i>The Dirty Life </i>is the captivating chronicle of their first year on Essex Farm, from the cold North Country winter through the following harvest season&#x2014;complete with their wedding in the loft of the barn. <br><br>Kimball and her husband had a plan: to grow everything needed to feed a community. It was an ambitious idea, a bit romantic, and it worked. Every Friday evening, all year round, a hundred people travel to Essex Farm to pick up their weekly share of the "whole diet"&#x2014;beef, pork, chicken, milk, eggs, maple syrup, grains, flours, dried beans, herbs, fruits, and forty different vegetables&#x2014;produced by the farm. The work is done by draft horses instead of tractors, and the fertility comes from compost. Kimball&#x2019;s vivid descriptions of landscape, food, cooking&#x2014;and marriage&#x2014;are irresistible. <br><br>"As much as you transform the land by farming," she writes, "farming transforms you." In her old life, Kimball would stay out until four a.m., wear heels, and carry a handbag. Now she wakes up at four, wears Carhartts, and carries a pocket knife. At Essex Farm, she discovers the wrenching pleasures of physical work, learns that good food is at the center of a good life, falls deeply in love, and finally finds the engagement and commitment she craved in the form of a man, a small town, and a beautiful piece of land <br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Kristin Kimball&nbsp;is a farmer and a writer living in northern New York.&nbsp;Prior to farming, Kimball worked as a freelance writer, writing teacher, and as an assistant to a literary agent in New York City. A graduate of&nbsp;Harvard University and the author of <i>The Dirty Life</i> and <i>Good Husbandry</i>, she and her husband Mark have run Essex Farm since 2003, where they live with their two&nbsp;daughters.&nbsp;&#x201c;<i>The Dirty Life</i> is a delightful, tumultuous, and tender story of the author's love affair with the man who becomes her husband and the farm they work together to restore. With wisdom and humor, Kristin Kimball describes how she abandoned her career in New York City, leaving behind everything she thought was important for a hard, distinctly unglamorous existence that turns out to be the most fulfilling thing she&#x2019;s ever done.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>JEANNETTE WALLS, author of <i>Half Broke Horses </i>and <i>The Glass Castle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Dirty Life</i> is a wonderfully told tale of one of the most interesting farms in the country.

Influenced by his friend Lord Henry Wotton, he is drawn into a corrupt double life; indulging his desires in secret while remaining a gentleman inthe eyes of polite society. Only his portrait bears the traces of his decadence. The novel was a succ�s de scandale and the book was later used as evidence against Wilde at the Old Bailey in 1895. It has lost none of its power to fascinate and disturb.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Georgia O&#39;Keeffe: A Life</h2><p>The first biography written with the full cooperation of the O&#39;Keeffe family examines the artist&#39;s long and distinguished career, her personal relationships, and her significance in terms of American art and the women&#39;s movement</p><p>6 x 9 1/4 trim. 94 illus.

When spirited redhead Molly Murphy was growing up a peasant on the coast of Ireland she always imagined there was something more in store for her. She couldn't have known how right she was until the day she became a murderer, albeit in self-defense. Under drastic circumstances, Molly is forced to strike out into a new world. With the police right behind her, Molly's only chance at escape is a false identity and a steamship that will take her far, far away: to America. <br><br>When her ship sails into New York Harbor, with the majestic figure of the Statue of Liberty providing comfort and inspiration, Molly is sure her whole life is in front of her. But she's got one last hurdle to clear: Ellis Island. She is just one among thousands of immigrants on the tiny island, awaiting their fate with anxiety and hope. Unfortunately for Molly, before she is able to leave the island a man is brutally murdered, his throat cut from ear to ear, and coincidence and fate make her a suspect in a crime she didn't commit. Under a cloud of suspicion, and due largely to a growing mutual attraction between Molly and the handsome police captain in charge of the case, she is allowed to leave Ellis Island for Manhattan. Unfortunately, she's got a mission she couldn't have anticipated: clear her own name of murder. Alone in a new country with no one to lean on, Molly hits the vibrant streets of New York intent on finding out what really happened. After all, if she can't, she'll be sent back to Ireland, where the dreaded gallows await. <br><br>With the sweeping skyline of 19th century New York and the gritty, pulsating underworld of recently arrived immigrants forming a vivid backdrop, Rhys Bowen transports readers back in time to America's not-so-distant past. The first entry in the Molly Murphy series is a fascinating look at our immigrant history as well as an intensely absorbing page-turner. <br></p><p>Molly Murphy is a very different character from Constable Evans in my other series. She's brash, flamboyant and doesn't always know when it is good to keep her mouth shut. <p>She is thus destined for a life of trouble, and fun. </p><p>Fans seem to identify strongly with her.</p><p>Praise for author Rhys Bowen</p><p>"For pure entertainment value, Rhys Bowen simply cannot be beat. . .Her skill as a storyteller is almost unmatched."&#x2015;Robin Agnew, <i>Ann Arbor Living</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Bowen does a splendid job of capturing the flavor of early 20th-century New York and bringing to life its warm and human inhabitants."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Bowen tells a phenomenal story."&#x2015;<i>Romantic Times</i> (Top Pick)</p></p><h2>C is for Corpse (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries)</h2><p>Used.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Grade 2-6-- Finding a princess who is the ``king's equal'' in comeliness, intelligence, and wealth is an order that confounds the wisest, most loyal councilors in this distant realm. Finding a book equal in quality and brilliance to this one is an even more formidable task. Paterson weaves her story within the structure of familiar fairy tales; she includes romance, repetition of language, the number three, and a moral of goodness and love triumphing over selfishness and greed. Her careful attention to the beauty and variety of descriptive language is evident on every page. The story gains dimension with the inclusion of ``the Wolf.'' At first glimpse, he seems a menacing, negative force, but he is revealed ultimately to be the purveyor of magic, and even the perfect matchmaker. He never intrudes upon court life in the capital city, but remains in his remote mountain lair, an enigmatic character to ponder at the story's end. Vagin's illustrations are exquisite, luminous in color, clarity, and precision. Readers are drawn into the courtly world of a wealthy kingdom through details of costume, architecture, furniture, and decorations. Because there are six chapters, the book is a lengthy read-aloud. This is, however, no drawback; young listeners will be a spellbound and appreciative audience, and should want to return to the book again and again. --Martha Rosen, Edgewood School, Scarsdale, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent Over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn&#39;t Commit</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller!</b><br><br>On Halloween 1975, Martha Moxley was found brutally murdered outside her home in swanky Greenwich, Connecticut. Twenty-seven years after her death, the State of Connecticut spent some $25 million to convict her friend and neighbor, Michael Skakel, of the murder. At Michael&#x2019;s criminal trial, the State offered no physical or forensic evidence, no fingerprints or DNA, no eyewitness linking Michael to the killing.

He chronicles how Skakel was, nevertheless, railroaded amidst a media frenzy by the devious actions of a crooked cop, a trio of mendacious writers, a treacherous family lawyer nursing a secret grudge, a narcissistic defense attorney obsessed by the spotlight, a craven prosecutor gone rogue, and a parade of perjuring witnesses. These colorful characters leap off the pages like seedy villains in a dime-store crime novel But it&#x2019;s all true.<br><br>Kennedy also shows how he tracked down the likely killers, a pair of ghosts who moved in and out of Greenwich and whose presence was detected by neither police nor press during 30 years of costly yet shoddy investigation. Today, those men walk free.<br><br>This startling expose an explosive exploration of murder and fame is the tragic true story of Skakel&#x2019;s conviction that the public has never heard.

The creating, supporting, nurturing aspect held by the goddess Ceres, the universal mother, brings us to how we feel nurtured and how we function with our roles of mother-child. She embodies the principle of unconditional love. Pallas Athena is our Warrior Goddess, a woman in a man&#39;s world, carrying the principle of creative intelligence. Vesta, our goddess of Focus and Commitment, is our High Priestess. Juno, the Queen of Heaven and Divine Consort, is our capacity for meaningful relationships. Understanding the themes that each goddess holds enriches our understanding of that function and expression in our lives.</p><p>Demetra George, halds a B.A. in Philosophy and M.A. Classics, received the 2002 Marion D.

Crist explores each of racing&#x2019;s so-called exotic wagers, including exactas, trifectas, superfectas, doubles, pick threes, pick fours, and pick sixes. Drawing on his personal experiences as a bettor and as a racing journalist and executive, Crist outlines both the common mistakes made by the betting public and some alternative approaches that can lead to more profitable returns and to greater enjoyment of an endlessly intricate and fascinating game.</p><p>Crist, known as the King of the Pick Six for his exploits in that jackpot wager, also explores a wide range of practical issues, including the advantages and pitfalls of betting on the sport&#x2019;s biggest events, such as the Triple Crown and Breeders&#x2019; Cup, and the unfairly onerous requirements imposed on exotic bettors by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re a two-dollar bettor considering his first exacta or a high roller regularly chasing seven-figure jackpots, Exotic Betting will forever change the way you look at and wager on horse racing.</p><p> Steven Crist has been playing the races and writing about them since a chance trip to Wonderland Greyhound Park in 1976 put a quick end to studying 18th-century English literature. He was the horse-racing columnist for The New York Times from 1981 through 1990; founding editor-in-chief of The Racing Times in 1991-92; a New York racetrack executive from 1994 to 1997; and in 1998 assembled an investment group that purchased Daily Racing Form, where he served as the chief executive until 2002 and remains as the chairman and publisher. Crist is the author of the books Offtrack, The Horse Traders, and Betting on Myself.</p>"Steve Crist became an extremely successful pick-six player by recognizing this truth: How you bet is at least as important as whom you bet. His book Exotic Betting will change teh way horseplayers think about the pick six, pick four, and other multiple wagers." Andrew Beyer Washington Post columnist <p>"With so many exotics on the wagering menu these days, players are stuck in teh quandary of exactly what pools to dive into to get the best bang for their buck. With his facile bent toward mathematics and teh understanding of odds, payots, takeouts, etc., Crist succeds in breaking down teh pluses and minuses of doubles, exactas, tris, supers, etc. in a logical way. This book is a plus for anyone who takes this difficult game seriously." Bob Neumeier NBN Sports </p><p>"In a sport known for ups and downs, Steve Crist is a beacon of consistency. Besides his intelligent horse-racing commentary, he simplifies teh complexities of exotic wagering better than anyone. Crist would be my first choice as professor in teh classroom of betting strategy."

Scammell, a free-lancer who writes about aerospace, medicine, and archaeology, was assisted by Douglas Ubelaker, a ``bone man'' from the Smithsonian, in writing this true-crime expos&#x201a; that reads more like an adventure in evidence-gathering. Revolving around Carl Drew--a Satanist and pimp with Manson-like powers who ordered his followers to kill two young prostitutes and 20-year-old Karen Marsden, whose skull fragment is the main piece of evidence in the forensic jigsaw puzzle--the ``lurid metaphysics'' of devil worship and ritual sacrifice take back seat here to detailed accounts of how police and prosecutors made sense out of a murder case with no body. Instead, they had to rely on bones, hair clumps, torn clothing, and the contradictory testimonies of the accused and his accomplices. Unfortunately, Scammell often resorts to the Dragnet- style Q&amp;As to integrate the mounds of interrogation transcripts. He is most interesting when he wanders from the narrative path and treats us to brief histories of skeletology, religious cults, and even Lizzie Borden's life. For the most part, though, Scammell's misplaced emphasis on technicalities makes us forget the real hideousness of the case. Though neatly written and edited, Scammell's story of sex, slaughter, and Satanism is too dry to live up to its subject. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this story of ritual murder in Fall River, Massachusetts in the late 1970s, the victims and suspects are pimps and prostitutes who practice satanic worship. While this book works best when detailing dogged police efforts to solve the murders, it is less compelling when describing the killers and their victims. The Manson-like character at the center of the book seems to be playing out dark and dangerous fantasies with victims who are passive to the point of inertia. One young mother goes to her death frightened but resigned. Little space is devoted to describing the rituals or even making the cult seem real. The book may not help anyone gain insight into the mind of satanic worshippers because one is left suspecting the satanic rituals were merely a way to embellish murders that would have taken place anyway.

King on <i>The Language of Bees</i></strong><br> <p>As a writer, I court serendipity.</p> <p>Another way to say that would be, as a writer, I really don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing.</p> <p>In a stand-alone novel it doesn&#x2019;t much matter that I pursue my plot-line in a dark attic with a failing flashlight, because in the early drafts I simply put everything down, then spend the rewrite peeling away whatever makes no sense or isn&#x2019;t absolutely necessary. And when I&#x2019;m finished with the novel, I&#x2019;m finished--with the book and with the characters.</p> <p>A series novel is a different animal. What I wrote in 1993, I have to live with in 2008, even if I no longer have the faintest idea what I had in mind back then. Sometimes this creates ridiculously convoluted problems, and I spend hours and hours paging through to find what color someone&#x2019;s eyes were or if I credited them with a certain skill, and I end up wishing I could just recall all copies of the earlier book and make people forget about that line on page 238. Other times, well, I&#x2019;d like to take credit for being such a genius planner, but as I said, I really don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing.</p> <p>However, some deep, distant, well-hidden part of my brain does, and when that Organizing Principle takes charge, things turn out in interesting ways.</p> <p>Take my newest book, <i>The Language of Bees</i>. This, the ninth Russell and Holmes novel, is set in the summer of 1924, and its central character (apart from the series regulars) is a young Surrealist artist by the name of Damian Adler. And for those readers who are up on their Conan Doyle, yes, it&#x2019;s THAT Adler. </p> <p>Back in 1994, I wrote a book called <i>A Monstrous Regiment of Women</i>, the second in the series. In one scene, Russell is trying to get away from Holmes for a while so she can think about her future without him looking over her shoulder. When a friend conveniently presents her with a drug-addled fianc� in need of assistance, Russell seizes the opportunity to shove the young man&#x2019;s problems onto Holmes and send them both away. One of the weapons she uses to force Holmes into agreement is a reference to his long lost son: </p><p>&#x201c;And if he were your son? Would you not want someone to try?&#x201d; It was a dirty blow, low and unscrupulous and quite unforgivably wicked. Because, you see, he did have a son once, and someone had tried. </p> <p>And this is pretty much the only appearance of this mythic entity, the son, despite queries and entreaties and speculations from readers. I could not even have said for certain why I inflicted the master detective with paternity, other than Russell&#x2019;s need for a weapon strong enough to bully Holmes into obedience, combined with the feeling that this drug-addled young officer needed to have a deeper meaning for Holmes than just a nursing job.</p> <p>But the Organizing Principle in the back of my mind knew why he was there.</p> <p>The &#x201c;lovely, lost son&#x201d; was glimpsed in <i>Monstrous Regiment</i> so that fourteen years later, I could sit down to write <i>The Language of Bees</i> and craft a situation as significant for Holmes as the psychic trauma of the previous book had been for Russell. <i>Locked Rooms</i> forced Russell to confront a past she had hidden from herself. <i>The Language of Bees</i> gives Holmes a second chance to know the son he had lost.</p> <p>(I should, perhaps, mention that this idea of Holmes having a son by Irene Adler--&#x201c;The woman&#x201d;--is not mine alone. W. S. Baring Gould, whose definitive biography of the master detective was recently updated by Leslie Klinger in <i>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i>, suggested the presence of a son. The boy, under the name Nero Wolfe, himself became a rather well-known detective.)</p> <p>As soon as my mind dangled the idea of Holmes&#x2019; son returning, a world of possibilities blossomed: Where had the young man been? (perhaps... Shanghai?) Why come back now? (A wife disappeared, and a murder, and--what about a child!) And since one of the Conan Doyle stories refers to the art in Holmes&#x2019; blood (his grandmother&#x2019;s brother was the artist Vernet) and since Irene Adler was an opera singer, why not make the son an artist--one of the Surrealists, just to put a twist in his relationship with the ultra-rational Holmes?</p> <p>I&#x2019;d like to say I had all this in mind back in 1995 when I had Mary Russell drop mention of Holmes&#x2019; son, but I prefer to save fiction for my novels. </p> And as I said at the beginning, as a writer, I court serendipity. I may not know what I&#x2019;m doing, but it makes for a more exciting journey, getting there. --<i>Laurie R. King</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Seth Affoumado)</p>Laurie R.

Historian John Thompson guides us through annotated selections of Smith's most important and compelling writings, adding authoritative perspective and commentary to round out the picture. The volume includes some of the earliest primary source accounts of life in colonial Virginia, including excerpts from <i>Proceedings of the English Colony of Virginia (1612), Generall Historie of Virginia (1624),</i> and <i>The True Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith (1630). </i> <br><br>Readers share eyewitness accounts of Smith's capture and imprisonment by the Indians, his explorations of the Chesapeake Bay region, and various other adventures and exploits in the New World. We get a firsthand look at Smith's pivotal role in the founding and governance of colonial Jamestown and his attempts to establish trade relationships with the Native Americans. We also learn the real facts behind Smith's relationship with Pocahontas&#x2014;an American legend that pervades our popular culture, from the animated Disney classic to the critically acclaimed 2005 film starring Colin Farrell. <br><br>With the upcoming 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, a whole new generation of readers and history buffs will be seeking more information about Smith and his fellow colonists. This lively, illustrated edition will be a valuable resource&#x2014;providing a fresh, accessible look at a key historical figure and conveying a vivid sense of what life in the New World was like.</p><p>Captain John Smith (1580-1631) was a founding member and, later, president of the governing council of the Jamestown settlement.

The music was too loud, the liquor was bottom-shelf, and the crowd was too young and rowdy to do anything but give him a headache. It was the last kind of place you&#x2019;d find a man like him. The last kind of place he wanted to be. Tonight, it suited his needs to a T. The place was dark and anonymous&#x2014;and no one would remember him.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d received four notes so far, each becoming progressively more disturbing. He discovered the first in his mailbox last week. <i>I know what you did.</i> The second was taped to the windshield of his Lexus. <i>I know what all of you did.</i> He found the third note lying on the threshold inside the storm door off the kitchen. <i>Meet me or I go to the police.</i> Each note was written in blue ink on a sheet of lined notebook paper that had been torn in half. He&#x2019;d found the fourth note earlier this evening, taped to the front door. <i>Hochstetler farm. 1 a.m. Come alone.</i></p> <p>At first he&#x2019;d tried to convince himself he didn&#x2019;t understand the meaning of the messages. There were a lot of crazies out there. He was a successful man, after all. He had a nice home. Lived a comfortable lifestyle. Drove an expensive car. In the eyes of a few, that made him fair game. A target because someone else wanted what he had, and they were willing to do whatever it took to get it.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d crumpled the notes and tossed them in the trash. He&#x2019;d done his best to forget about them. But he knew the problem wasn&#x2019;t going to go away.</p> <p><i>I know what all of you did.</i></p> <p>Someone knew things they shouldn&#x2019;t. About him. About the others. About that night. They knew things no one could possibly know.</p> <p><i>Unless they&#x2019;d been there,</i> a little voice added.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d racked his brain, trying to figure out who. There was only one explanation: Someone was going to blackmail him. But who?</p> <p>Then two nights ago, he saw her, walking alongside the road near his house. But when he&#x2019;d stopped for a better look, she was gone, leaving him to wonder if he&#x2019;d seen anything at all. Or maybe it was his conscience playing tricks on him.</p> <p>It had been years since he spoke to the others. But after receiving the third note, he&#x2019;d done his due diligence and made the calls. None of them admitted to having received any sort of suspicious correspondence, but promised to let him know if that changed. If any of them knew more than they were letting on, they didn&#x2019;t let it show.</p> <p>After finding the latest note, he&#x2019;d gone about his business as usual the rest of the evening. He&#x2019;d ordered Chinese takeout and watched a movie. Afterwards, he&#x2019;d broken the seal on the bottle of Macallan Scotch whisky his daughter gave him for Christmas two years ago. At eleven thirty, restless and edgy, he&#x2019;d opened the gun cabinet, loaded the Walther .380 and dropped it into the inside pocket of his jacket. Grabbing the keys to his Lexus, he drove to the only place he knew of that was still open: the Brass Rail Saloon.</p> <p>Now, sitting at a back booth with chain saw rock echoing in his ears and two shots of watered-down Scotch burning a hole in his gut, he stared at the clock on the wall and waited.</p> <p><i>I know what all of you did.</i></p> <p>Watching two young girls who didn&#x2019;t look old enough to drink head toward the dance floor, he tugged his iPhone from his pocket and scrolled down to the number he wanted. It was too late to call, especially a man who was little more than a stranger to him these days, so he drafted a text instead.</p> <p><i>Meet is on. Will call 2 let you know outcome.</i></p> <p>He sat there for a moment before pressing Send, staring at the phone, assuring himself there was no way anyone could know what he&#x2019;d done. It had been thirty-five years. A lifetime. He&#x2019;d married, built a successful real estate firm, raised four children, and gone through a divorce. He was semi-retired now. A grandfather and respected member of the community. He&#x2019;d put that night behind him. Forgotten it had ever happened. Or tried to.</p> <p><i>Someone knows.</i></p> <p>A knife-stab of dread sank deep into his gut. Sighing, he dropped the phone back into his pocket and glanced up at the clock again. Almost 1 A.M. Time to go. Finishing his drink, he grabbed his keys off the table and then made for the door.</p> <p>Ten minutes later he was heading north on Old Germantown Road. Around him the rain was coming down so hard, he could barely see the dividing lines.</p> <p>&#x201c;Keep it between the beacons,&#x201d; he muttered, taking comfort in the sound of his own voice.</p> <p>All these years, he&#x2019;d believed the past no longer had a hold on him. Sometimes he almost convinced himself that night had never really happened. That it was a recurring nightmare and an overactive imagination run amok. But on nights like this, the truth had a way of sneaking up on you, like a garrote slipping over your head. And he knew&#x2014;he&#x2019;d always known&#x2014;somewhere inside the beating, cancerous mass that was his conscience, that some sins could never be forgiven. He owed penance for what he&#x2019;d done. And he&#x2019;d always known that someday fate or God&#x2014;or maybe Satan himself&#x2014;would see to it that he paid his debt.</p> <p>Gripping the steering wheel, he leaned forward so that his nose was just a few inches from the windshield. The rain drumming against the roof was as loud as a hail of bullets against tin siding. On the stereo Jim Morrison&#x2019;s haunting voice rose above the roar. There was something reassuring about music on nights like this. It was a sign of life and reminded him there were other people out there and made him feel less isolated and a little less alone. Tonight, he swore to God that was the same song that had been playing that night.</p> <p>Glancing away from the road, he reached down and punched the button for another station. When he looked up, she was there, on the road, scant yards from his bumper. He stomped the brake hard. The Lexus skidded sideways. The headlights played crazily against the curtain of rain, the black trunks of the trees. The car spun 180 degrees before jolting to a halt, facing the wrong direction.</p> <p>For the span of several heartbeats, he sat there, breathing heavily, gripping the wheel hard enough to make his knuckles ache. He&#x2019;d never believed in ghosts, but he knew there was no way in hell he could have seen what his eyes were telling him. Wanetta Hochstetler had been dead for thirty-five years. It had to be the booze playing tricks on him.</p> <p>Fearing a cop would happen by and find him sitting in his car in the dead of night with his hands shaking and the smell of rotgut whiskey on his breath, he turned the vehicle around. But he couldn&#x2019;t leave. Not without making sure. He squinted through the windshield, but his headlight beams revealed nothing on the road or shoulder. A quiver of uneasiness went through him when he spotted the old mailbox. The thing had been bashed in a dozen times over the decades&#x2014;by teenagers with beer bottles or baseball bats&#x2014;and even peppered with holes from shotgun pellets. But he could still make out the name: HOCHSTETLER.</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t have a slicker or flashlight, but there was no avoiding getting out of the vehicle. He was aware of the pistol in his pocket, but it didn&#x2019;t comfort him, didn&#x2019;t make him feel any safer. Leaving the engine running, he turned up the collar of his jacket and swung open the door. Rain lashed his face as he stepped into the night. Water poured down his collar, the cold clenching the back of his neck like cadaver fingers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; he called out.</p> <p>He went around to the front of the vehicle and checked the bumper and hood. No dents. No blood. Just to be sure, he rounded the front end and ran his hands over the quarter panel on the passenger side, too. Not so much as a scratch. He hadn&#x2019;t hit anything, human or otherwise. Just his tired eyes playing tricks&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>He was standing outside the passenger door when she stepped out of the darkness and fog. The sight of her paralyzed him with fear. With something worse than fear. The knowledge that he&#x2019;d been wrong. That time never forgot, no matter how badly you wanted it to&#x2014;and the reckoning had finally come.</p> <p>Her dress clung to a body that was still slender and strong and supple. The pouring rain and darkness obscured the details of her face. But she still had that rose-petal mouth and full lips. Long hair that had yet to go gray. He knew it was impossible for her to be standing there, unchanged, after all these years. After what happened to her. After what they <i>did</i> to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be you.&#x201d; The voice that squeezed from his throat was the sound of an old man on his deathbed, gagging on his own sputum, begging for a miracle that wasn&#x2019;t going to come.</p> <p>Her mouth pulled into a smile that turned his skin to ice. &#x201c;You look surprised to see me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d; He scraped unsteady fingers over his face, blinked water from his eyes. But when he opened them, she was still there, as alive and familiar as the woman who&#x2019;d been visiting his nightmares for thirty-five years. &#x201c;How&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p> <p>Never taking her eyes from his, she opened the driver&#x2019;s-side door, and killed the engine. Keys in hand, she went to the rear of the vehicle and pressed the trunk release. The latch clicked and the trunk sprang open.</p> <p>&#x201c;Get in,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>When he didn&#x2019;t move she produced a revolver and leveled it at his chest. He thought of the Walther in his pocket, wondered if he could get to it before she shot him dead.</p> <p>He raised his hands. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p> <p>Stepping closer, she jabbed the revolver at him so that the muzzle was just two feet from his forehead. Her arm was steady, her finger inside the guard, snug against the trigger. &#x201c;Do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shaking uncontrollably, he climbed into the trunk and looked up at her. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t mean it. <i>I swear we didn&#x2019;t mean it.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t hear the shot.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Belinda Harrington stood on the porch of her father&#x2019;s house and knocked on the door hard enough to rattle the frame. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; She waited a minute and then used the heel of her hand and gave the wood a dozen hard whacks. &#x201c;<i>Dad?</i> You home?&#x201d;</p> <p>She&#x2019;d been trying to reach him for two days now, but he hadn&#x2019;t returned her calls. That wasn&#x2019;t unusual; the man was independent to a fault. He&#x2019;d been known to ignore calls when it suited him. Still, two days was a long time. Even for Dale Michaels.</p> <p>Wishing she&#x2019;d remembered to bring her umbrella, she scanned the driveway through the cascade of water coming off the roof. His Lexus was parked in its usual spot; he had to be here somewhere. She wondered if he&#x2019;d found himself a lady friend and they were holed up at her place or a hotel up in Wooster. Belinda wouldn&#x2019;t put it past him. Mom hadn&#x2019;t come right out and said it, but she let Belinda know in no uncertain terms that fidelity had never been one of Dale Michaels&#x2019;s strong points.</p> <p>Cupping her hands on either side of her mouth, she called for him. &#x201c;Dad!&#x201d;</p> <p>Her eyes wandered to the barn twenty yards away, and for the first time, she noticed the sliding door standing open a couple of feet. Though he&#x2019;d never been burglarized, her father was a stickler about security. He wouldn&#x2019;t leave the barn door open, especially if he wasn&#x2019;t home. The initial fingers of worry kneaded the back of her neck. Had he gone out to feed the chickens and fallen? Was he lying there, unable to get up and waiting for help? He wasn&#x2019;t accident prone, but she supposed something could&#x2019;ve happened. What if he&#x2019;d had a heart attack?</p> <p>Tenting her jacket over her head, she jogged across the gravel. The rain was really coming down, and by the time she reached the barn, her shoes and the hem of her pants were soaked. Shoving open the barn door another foot, Belinda stepped inside and shook rain from her jacket. The interior was dark and smelled of chicken poop and moldy hay. A few feet away, three bantam hens scratched and pecked at the floor. Stupid things. She wondered why her father kept them. Half the time, they didn&#x2019;t lay eggs and spent their days tearing up the petunias she&#x2019;d planted for him last spring. Pulling her jacket closed against the cold, she flipped the light switch, but the single bulb didn&#x2019;t help much.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad? You out here?&#x201d;</p> <p>Belinda listened for a response, but it was difficult to hear anything above the incessant pound of rain against the tin shingles. There were a dozen or so places where water dripped down from the leaky roof to form puddles on the dirt floor. At least the chickens had plenty to drink.</p> <p>The barn was a massive structure with falling-down horse stalls and high rafters laced with cobwebs. As kids, she and her brother had played out here; they&#x2019;d even had a pony once. But neither she nor her brother had been interested in animals, and once her father had gotten his real estate company up and running, the place became a workshop where he tinkered with cars. The workbench with the Peg-Board back was still there, but the tools were covered with dust. A dozen or so boards were stacked haphazardly against the wall. The old rototiller stood in silhouette against the window where dingy light bled in. When her brother was twelve years old, he&#x2019;d nearly taken his foot off with that thing.</p> <p>The loose dirt from the floor stuck to her shoes as she crossed to the workbench. Belinda called out for him one final time and started for the door. She was midway there when something to her right, on the other side of a fat beam caught her attention. Cautiously, she moved closer and looked up, found herself staring at the leather soles of shoes and the hems of slacks. She stumbled back, her eyes taking in legs and then the torso of a man. One arm hanging down. Neck bent at an unnatural angle.</p> <p>A sound she didn&#x2019;t recognize tore from her throat.

She has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in society and law from Purdue University.One<br><br> Not Quite Scotland<br><br> It was a land of shadows and ice.<br><br> Of gray. And grayer. And black.<br><br> Deep in the shadows lurked inhuman creatures, twisted of limb and hideous of countenance. Things one did well to avoid seeing.<br><br> Should the creatures enter the pale bars of what passed for light in the terrible place, they would die, painfully and slowly. As would he-the mortal Highlander imprisoned within columns of sickly light-should he succeed in breaking the chains that held him and seek escape through those terrifying shadows.<br><br> Jagged cliffs of ice towered above him. A frigid wind shrieked through dark labyrinthine canyons, bearing a susurrus of desolate voices and faint, hellish screams. No sun, no fair breeze of Scotland, no scent of heather penetrated his frozen, bleak hell.<br><br> He hated it. His very soul cringed at the horror of the place.<br><br> He ached for the warmth of the sun on his face and hungered for the sweet crush of grass beneath his boots. He would have given years of his life for the surety of his stallion between his thighs and the solid weight of his claymore in his grip.<br><br> He dreamed-when he managed to escape the agony of his surroundings by retreating deep into his mind-of the blaze of a peat fire, scattered with sheaves of heather. Of a woman's warm, loving caresses. Of buttery, golden-crusted bread hot from the hearth. Simple things. Impossible things.<br><br> For the son of a Highland chieftain, who'd passed a score and ten in resplendent mountains and vales, five years was an intolerable sentence; an incarceration that would be withstood only by force of will, by careful nurturing of the light of hope within his heart.<br><br> But he was a strong man, with the royal blood of Scottish kings running hot and true in his veins. He would survive. He would return and reclaim his rightful place, woo and win a bonny lass with a tender heart and a tempestuous spirit like his mother, and fill the halls of Dun Haakon with the music of wee ones.<br><br> With such dreams, he withstood five years in the hellish wasteland.<br><br> Only to discover the dark king had deceived him.<br><br> His sentence had never been five years at all, but five faery years: five hundred years in the land of shadow and ice.<br><br> On that day when his heart turned to ice within his breast, on that day when a single tear froze upon his cheek, on that day when he was denied even the simple solace of dreaming, he came to find his prison a place of beauty.<br><br> "My queen, the Unseelie king holds a mortal captive."<br><br> The Seelie queen's face remained impassive, lest her court see how deeply disturbing she found the messenger's news. Long had the Seelie Court of Light and the Unseelie Court of Dark battled. Long had the Unseelie king provoked her. "Who is this mortal?" she asked coolly.<br><br> "Aedan MacKinnon, son and heir of the Norse princess Saucy Mary and Findanus MacKinnon, from Dun Haakon on the Isle of Skye."<br><br> "Descendent of the Scottish king, Kenneth McAlpin," the queen mused aloud. "The Unseelie king grows greedy, his aim lofty, if he seeks to turn the seed of the McAlpin to his dark ways. What bargain did he strike with this mortal?"<br><br> "He sent his current Hand of Vengeance into the world to bring death to the mortal's clansmen yet bartered that if the mortal willingly consented to spend five years in his kingdom, he would spare his kin."<br><br> "And the MacKinnon agreed?"<br><br> "The king concealed from him that five years in Faery is five centuries. Still, as grandseed of the McAlpin, I suspect the MacKinnon would have accepted the full term to protect his clan."<br><br> "What concession does the king make?" the queen asked shrewdly. Any bargain between faery and mortal must hold the possibility for the human to regain his freedom. Still, no mortal had ever bested a fairy in such a bargain.<br><br> "At the end of his sentence, he will be granted one full cycle of the moon in the mortal world, at his home at Dun Haakon. If, by the end of that time, he is loved and loves in return, he will be free. If not, he serves as the king's new Hand of Vengeance until the king chooses to replace him, at which time he dies."<br><br> The queen made a sound curiously like a sigh. By such cruel methods had the Unseelie king long fashioned his deadly, prized assassin-his beloved Vengeance-by capturing a mortal, driving him past human limits into madness, indurating him to all emotion, then endowing him with special powers and arts.<br><br> Since the Unseelie king was barred entrance to the human world, he trained his Vengeance to carry out his orders, to hold no act too heinous. Mortals dared not even whisper the icy assassin's name, lest they inadvertently draw his merciless attention. If a man angered the Unseelie king, Vengeance punished the mortal's clan, sparing no innocents. If grumblings about the faery were heard, Vengeance silenced them in cruelly imaginative ways. If the royal house was not amenable to the fairy world, Vengeance toppled kings as carelessly as one might sweep a chessboard.<br><br> Until now, it had been the Unseelie king's wont to abduct an insignificant mortal, one without clan who would not be missed, to train as his Vengeance. He went too far this time, the Seelie queen brooded, abducting a blood grandson of one of fair Scotia's greatest kings-a man of great honor, noble and true of heart.<br><br> She would win this mortal back.<br><br> The queen was silent for a time. Then, "Ah, what five hundred years in that place will do to him," she breathed in a chilling voice. The Unseelie king had named the terms of his bargain well. Aedan MacKinnon would still be mortal at the end of his captivity but no longer remotely human when released. Once, long ago and never forgotten, she'd traversed that forbidden land herself, danced upon a pinnacle of black ice, slept within the dark king's velvet embrace . . .<br><br> "Perhaps an enchanted tapestry," she mused, "to bring the MacKinnon the one true mate to his heart." She could not fight the Unseelie king directly, lest the clash of their magic too gravely damage the land. But she could and would do all in her power to ensure Aedan MacKinnon found love at the end of his imprisonment.<br><br> "My queen," the messenger offered hesitantly, "they shall have but one bridge of the moon in the sky. Perhaps they should meet in the Dreaming."<br><br> The queen pondered a moment. The Dreaming: that elusive, much-sought, everforgotten realm where mortals occasionally brushed pale shoulder to iridescent wing with the fairy. That place where mortals would be astonished to know battles were won and lost, universes born, and true love preordained, from Cleopatra and Mark Antony to Abelard and Heloise. The lovers could meet in the Dreaming and share a lifetime of loving before they ever met in the mortal realm. It would lay a grand foundation for success of her plan.<br><br> "Wisely spoken," the queen agreed. Rising from her floral bower with fluid grace, she raised her arms and began to sing.<br><br> From her melody a tapestry was woven, of faery lore, of bits of blood and bone, of silken hair from the great, great-grandson of the McAlpin, of ancient rites known only to the True Race. As she sang, her court chanted:<br><br> Into the Dreaming lure them deep<br><br> where they shall love whilst they doth sleep<br><br> then in the waking both shall dwell<br><br> 'til love's fire doth melt his ice-borne hell.<br><br> And when the tapestry was complete, the queen marveled.<br><br> "Is this truly the likeness of Aedan MacKinnon?" she asked, eyeing the tapestry with unmistakable erotic interest.<br><br> "I have seen him, and it is so," the messenger replied, wetting his lips, his gaze fixed upon the tapestry.<br><br> "Fortunate woman," the queen said silkily.<br><br> The faery queen went to him in the Dreaming, well into his sentence, when he was quite mad. Tracing a curved nail against his icy jaw, she whispered in his ear, "Hold fast, MacKinnon, for I have found you the mate to your soul. She will warm you. She will love you above all others."<br><br> The monster chained to the ice threw back his dark head and laughed.<br><br> It was not a human sound at all.<br><br> Two<br><br> Present Day Oldenburg, Indiana<br><br> Jane sillee had an intensely passionate relationship with her postman.<br><br> It was classic love-hate.<br><br> The moment she heard him whistling his way down her walk, her heart kicked into overtime, a sappy smile curved her lips, and her breathing quickened.<br><br> But the moment he failed to deliver the acceptance letter extolling the wonders of her manuscript, or worse, handed her a rejection letter, she hated him. Hated him. Knew it was his fault somehow. That maybe, just maybe, a publisher had written glowing things about her, he'd dropped the letter because he was careless, the wind had picked it up and carried it off, and even now her bright and shining future lay sodden and decomposing in a mud puddle somewhere.<br><br> Just how much could a federal employee be trusted, anyway? she brooded suspiciously. He could be part of some covert study designed to determine how much one tortured writer could endure before snapping and turning into a pen-wielding felon.<br><br> "Purple prose, my ass," she muttered, balling up the latest rejection letter. "I only used black ink. I can't afford a color ink cartridge." She kicked the door of her tiny apartment shut and slumped into her secondhand Naugahyde recliner.<br><br> Massaging her temples, she scowled. She simply had to get this story published. She'd become convinced it was the only way she was ever going to get him out of her mind.<br><br> Him. Her sexy, dark-haired Highlander. The one who came to her in dreams.</p><h2>Sole Survivor</h2><p>A catastrophic, unexplainable plane crash leaves three hundred and thirty dead&#x2014; no survivors. Among the victims are the wife and two daughters of Joe Carpenter, a Los Angeles Post crime reporter.<br><br>A year after the crash, still gripped by an almost paralyzing grief, Joe encounters a woman named Rose, who claims to have survived the crash. She holds out the possibility of a secret that will bring Joe peace of mind. But before he can ask any questions, she slips away.<br><br>Driven now by rage (have the authorities withheld information?) and a hope almost as unbearable as his grief (if there is one survivor, are there others?), Joe sets out to find the mysterious woman. His search immediately leads him into the path of a powerful and shadowy organization hell-bent on stopping Rose before she can reveal what she knows about the crash.<br><br>Sole Survivor unfolds at a heart-stopping pace, as a desperate chase and a shattering emotional odyssey lead Joe to a truth that will force him to reassess everything he thought he knew about life and death&#x2014;a truth that, given the chance, will rock the world and redefine the destiny of humanity.</p><p>Joe Carpenter, the hero of Dean Koontz's newest novel, <i>Sole Survivor,</i> is a man nearly paralyzed by grief. One year earlier, his wife and two children had been among the 230 victims of a plane crash that left no survivors. So when Joe encounters a woman who claims to have been aboard that plane and survived the catastrophe, and then she almost immediately disappears, he is understandably riled up. In the course of trying to track this woman down, Joe finds himself entangled in a web of shadowy conspiracy and perilous secrets. <p> In this latest book, Koontz pumps up the volume and gives his readers what they've come to expect from him: an expert mix of cover ups, cults, bizarre suicides, and a shocking twist at the end that keeps <i>Sole Survivor</i> racing along from one improbable but undeniably thrilling event to the next.</p>Critical acclaim for SOLE SURVIVOR<br><br>"Masterfully styled serious entertainment. These are Koontz's great years."<br>--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"This is a book about hope . . . to keep you awake reading long into the night, but for once not afraid to turn out the light. Nice one, Mr. Koontz."<br>--London Times<br><br>"Koontz, as did John Milton before him, has used autobiography and image, human life and imaginative fiction, time and eternity, to justify the ways of God to men.

And that's all right by me, because I just love throwing birthday parties for my family and close family friends. Because some months have multiple birthdays, I've found that it was easier if I picked one Sunday in each month and celebrated all the birthdays for that month on the same day. Take March, for example. This past March we had five birthdays, which meant five cakes, because one of the rules is "Everybody has his own cake." For this I have to confess I just go to the local grocery store, head straight for the bakery department, and order each guest of honor a personalized birthday cake. Then I bake a homemade pound cake and serve it along with fresh sweetened strawberries, ice cream, and fresh whipped cream. That gives everybody a traditional cake as well as that scrumptious, scrumptious homemade cake. Well, I'm really getting ahead of myself with this story, though, because before anyone can sing, blow out their candles, and eat birthday cake, there are a lot of things that have to happen first!<br><br>A few years back, I realized that our childhoods were getting further and further behind us, and that made me sad. So I set out to find a way to step back in time and recapture a small piece of that time when our lives were worry free. I decided one way to do this was through the wonderful, silly games we all played at our childhood birthday parties. Well, needless to say, when I announced that this birthday celebration was going to involve games, the moans and groans commenced. All the adult children said, "But we don't want to play games," and my response was, "If you're physically able, you must play the games, or no cake for you." Well, it took all of about three minutes for the hoots and hollers of laughter to begin. To this day, I cannot tell you who had the most fun -- Jamie and Bobby playing pin the tail on the donkey, or Michelle and Anthony running the three-legged race. I also found that the guys love bashing a pi�ata.<br><br>So I'm happy to say, now on Birthday Sundays, when I clap my hands and yell, "Okay, let the games begin," everybody is eager to play. I also found that these games really work up a hearty appetite. So after the games and before the birthday cake we all share a scrumptious meal together. Michael and I always make sure to plan a meal that is easy to prepare for a large crowd. Michael does the outside cooking while I prepare the inside dishes. It's really a toss-up between the most requested meal, but it's almost always a low-country boil or a Beer-in-the-Rear Chicken.<br><br>Michael and I would like to share with y'all one of our Birthday Bash menus and hope that your family and friends enjoy it as much as ours do.<br><br><b>Beer-in-the-Rear Chicken</b><br><br>1. Wash and drain the chicken and pat dry. Coat the chicken inside and out with seasoned salt and House Seasoning. Refrigerate until ready to cook.<br><br>2. Prepare the charcoal grill. When the coals are hot and glowing, carefully push them over to the sides of the grill, leaving an open space in the middle of the grill. Open the can of beer and pour off approximately 1/4 cup. Insert the sprig of rosemary into the can, then place the beer can, keeping it upright, into the rear cavity of the chicken. Carefully place the chicken, standing up on the beer can, in the center of the grill, facing one of the banks of coals, making sure not to spill the beer. Cover the grill and cook the chicken for approximately 1 hour, or until done, rotating the chicken as necessary. The chicken is done when the juice runs clear when pierced with a fork.<br><br>3. Carefully remove the beer can from the chicken using mitts and discard the can. Cut the chicken into halves or quarters. I personally don't want any sauce on this chicken, but I always offer barbecue sauces and hot sauces to my guests.<br><br><i>One chicken serves 2 to 4, depending on appetites. My crowd can all eat half a chicken each, easy.</i><br><br><b>Bacon-Wrapped Grilled Corn on the Cob</b><br><br>1. Gently pull back the husks, completely exposing the kernels, but do not remove the husks. Remove the corn silk and use a brush to make sure all the silk is removed. In a large pot filled with water, soak the corn for 30 minutes.<br><br>2. Preheat the grill to medium.<br><br>3. Remove the corn from the water and pat dry. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it spiral-fashion around an ear of corn. Fold the husk back over the corn and bacon. Tie the husk with butcher string. Repeat the process for each ear of corn. Place the corn on the hot grill and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is cooked and the corn is tender, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The bacon will not be brown, which doesn't bother me one bit, but if it bothers you, gently pull the husks back and run the corn under the broiler for a few minutes until the bacon is brown. Serve with butter!<br><br><i>Serves 8</i><br><br><b>Green Beans with New Potatoes</b><br><br><i>My children's favorite green beans were cooked by their Great-Grandmother Paul. She used very little water and always wilted them. It dawned on me a couple of months back that while I had been cookin' these like Grandmama Paul did for years, I didn't have an exact formula. So the other day, I went into the kitchen at the restaurant and wrote down exactly everything I did. Well, I brought home that pot of beans and potatoes for Michael's supper. I served them alongside of Lace Hoecake Corn Bread and sliced tomatoes with onions. We fixed our plates and started eating, when all of a sudden Michael put down his fork, looked at me, and said, "Paula, those are the best green beans I have ever eaten." Needless to say, that little statement made me very happy, and once again proved that Grandmama Paul was a fabulous teacher.</i><br><br>1. Remove the ends from the beans. Snap the beans in two, place into a colander, wash, and set aside to drain.<br><br>2. Meanwhile, in a large cast-iron Dutch oven, lightly brown the salt pork in the bacon grease over medium heat, turning often, for approximately 10 minutes.<br><br>3. Toss the green beans into the pot, stirring them with a wooden spoon to coat well with the pork fat. Add the stock and House Seasoning. Cook over medium-low heat, covered tightly, for approximately 30 minutes, or until the beans are half done.<br><br>4. While the beans are cooking, peel a center strip from each new potato with a potato peeler. At the end of 30 minutes, add the potatoes and onion to the beans; add 1/4 cup more broth if needed. Cook, covered tightly, until the potatoes are tender, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, periodically checking the pot to make sure a small amount of liquid remains. When the potatoes are tender, tilt the lid slightly, off to the side of the pot, and continue to cook until the green beans are wilted, approximately 15 minutes.<br><br><i>Serves 8 to 10</i><br><br><i>My tips for cooking phenomenal green beans: Stir often. Add additional chicken broth in small amounts as needed, but don't drown your beans.</i><br><br><b>Lace Hoecake Corn bread</b><br><br>1. Combine the cornmeal, salt, and 2 1/2 cups water and allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes.<br><br>2. Spray a flat hoe skillet with vegetable oil cooking spray and drizzle with approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil. Heat the skillet over medium heat. Pour about three 2-ounce ladlefuls of the batter onto the skillet. The batter will sizzle and have a lacy appearance. If the batter gets too thick, add a bit of water. When the edges are slightly brown, place a wet glass plate over the hoecake. With a pot holder, grab the handle of the pan and flip the plate and pan so the hoecake falls onto the plate. Slide the hoecake off the plate back into the pan to cook the other side, and cook until golden brown. <br><br>3. Stir the batter and add additional oil to the pan before making your next hoecake.<br><br><i>Makes 8 to 10 large hoecakes, or 24 to 36 small hoecakes</i><br><br><b>note:</b> If you do not have a hoe skillet, make small (2- to 3-inch) hoecakes in a flat, cast-iron skillet.<br><br><b>Roasted Carrots</b><br><br><i>This is my son Jamie's favorite way to eat carrots. I buy the baby carrots already peeled and cleaned; they are uniform in size and cook evenly; but you can peel and quarter large carrots if you prefer. This dish is so simple, yet so delicious.</i><br><br>1. Preheat the oven to 350�F.<br><br>2. In a large bowl, coat the carrots with the olive oil. Toss with the House Seasoning and place in a 13-by-9-inch roasting pan. Roast until tender, approximately 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss the carrots with the butter and chopped parsley.<br><br><i>Serves 6 to 8</i><br><br><b>Buttermilk Biscuits</b><br><br><i>Do yourself a huge favor and pick up frozen Pillsbury Oven Baked Buttermilk Biscuits. Hide the bag and take the bows!</i><br><br><b>Buttermilk Pound Cake</b><br><br><i>Buttermilk gives this cake its delicious tang.</i><br><br>1. Preheat the oven to 325�F. Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.<br><br>2. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and set aside.<br><br>3. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter, shortening, and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk alternately to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Add the vanilla and mix well.<br><br>4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 13/4 hours, or until the cake is done. (The cake will pull away from the sides of the pan when ready, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake will come out clean.) Remove the cake from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a cake plate and serve each big slice of cake topped with strawberries and whipped cream.<br><br><i>Serves 8</i><br><br><b>Fresh Strawberries</b><br><br>Dissolve the sugar in 1/3 cup warm water, add to the strawberries, and toss.

Drawing on new scholarship in the social sciences, Betty Friedan attacked a wide range of institutions&#x2015;among them women&#x2019;s magazines, women&#x2019;s colleges, and advertisers&#x2015;for promoting a one-dimensional image of women as happy housewives. This image, Friedan suggested, created a &#x201c;feminine mystique,&#x201d; a belief that &#x201c;fulfillment as a woman had only one definition for American women after 1949&#x2015;the housewife-mother.&#x201d; The book soon became a national best seller, with over a million copies sold.<br><br> This Norton Critical Edition of Friedan&#x2019;s phenomenal book traces its cultural and historical significance over its first fifty years. The text of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> is accompanied by an introduction and is fully annotated.<br><br> Friedan&#x2019;s book is the product of her early life as an activist, a student, and an intellectual while also drawing on her own experiences as a wife and mother. &#x201c;Origins and Influences&#x201d; includes writings that helped shape the author&#x2019;s ideas about women and society. These works are topically organized: &#x201c;Childhood World,&#x201d; &#x201c;Intellectual Influences,&#x201d; &#x201c;Domesticity and &#x2018;Momism&#x2019; during the Cold War,&#x201d; &#x201c;Popular-Front Feminism,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Power of the Feminine Mystique on Betty Friedan?,&#x201d; and finally, &#x201c;Female Labor Force Participation Trends in the Twentieth Century.&#x201d; Among the authors included are Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd, Friedrich Engels, Margaret Mead, Amram Scheinfeld, and Simone de Beauvoir.<br><br> The 1960s was a time of great upheaval in America with sweeping changes throughout society including women&#x2019;s rights, civil rights, peace movements, environmental movements, student activism, and the sexual revolution. It was also a time when a number of American Jewish intellectuals, including Friedan, made comparisons between American life and Nazi destruction. &#x201c;The Turn of the Sixties: Political, Intellectual, and Cultural Ferment&#x201d; provides readers with an understanding of <em>The Feminine Mystique&#x2019;s</em> contemporary context through relevant U.S. government documents and through the voices of, among others, Eleanor Roosevelt, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Helen Gurley Brown, and Bruno Bettelheim.<br><br> More impressive than even <em>The Feminine Mystique&#x2019;s</em> best-seller status and the debate it sparked in the national press is its broader cultural significance. Hundreds of women wrote to Friedan about how the book affected them personally. &#x201c;Impact&#x201d; includes a selection of these letters from the Betty Friedan Papers, along with feminist writings from the second (Pauli Murray, Robin Morgan, Bella Abzug) and third (Rebecca Walker, Naomi Wolf, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards) waves of feminism, and the backlash against the movement and <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> (Phyllis Schlafly).<br><br> The book also includes a section on the scholarship on <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, with excerpts from scholars such as Daniel Horowitz, Joanne Meyerowitz, Ruth Rosen, and Stephanie Coontz. Analyses of Betty Friedan as a historian, the evolution of her ideas, and the legacy of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> on its fiftieth anniversary are included.<br><br> A Chronology of Betty Friedan&#x2019;s life and work and a Selected Bibliography are also included.</p><p>First published in 1963, <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> ignited a revolution that profoundly changed our culture, our conciousness, and our lives. Today it newly penetrates to the heart of isuues determining our lives -- and sounds a call to arms against the very real dangers of a newe feminine mystique in the economic and political turbulence of the 1990s.<p> Three decades later, the underlying issues raised by Betty Friedan strike at the core of the problems women still face at home and in the marketplace. As women continue to struggle for equality, to keep their hard-won gains, to find fulfillment in their careers, marriage and family, <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> remains the seminal conciousness-raising work of our times.</p>Betty Friedan (1921&#x2013;2006), a transformational leader of the women&#x2019;s movement, founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) and authored many works, including The Second Stage, The Fountain of Age, and Life So Far.</p><h2>Fables Vol. 10: The Good Prince</h2><p>Collecting issues #60-69 of the hit series, collecting the epochal &#34;Good Prince&#34; storyline.

During that time, he's had work published by nearly every comics publisher in the business, and he's created many critically acclaimed comic book series, including <i>Elementals, Coventry, Proposition Players</i>, and of course the seminal Vertigo series <i>Fables</i>, as well as its spin-off series <i>Fairest, Jack of Fables</i> and <i>The Literals</i>. His work has been nominated for many awards, including the Eisner, Harvey, and Ignatz comic industry awards and the International Horror Guild award.

In addition to illustrating all of Neil Gaiman's run on the post-Alan Moore <i>Miracleman</i> in the early 1990s, Buckingham contributed inks to <i>The Sandman</i> and its related miniseries <i>Death: The High Cost of Living</i> and <i>Death: The Time of Your Life</i> as well as working on various other titles for Vertigo and Marvel through the end of the decade. In 2002 he took over as the penciller for Bill Willingham's <i>Fables</i>, which has gone on to become one of the most popular and critically acclaimed Vertigo titles of the new millennium. When not in Clevedon, Buckingham can be found with his wife Irma in the Asturias region of northern Spain.This long arc of the epical Fables continuum unfolds the story of how Fabletown janitor Flycatcher, who was a frog for a while, returns to the kingdom of which he was prince and sets up a haven within the Homelands for fables seeking refuge from the oppressive rule of the emperor and the Adversary&#x2014;a haven, moreover, that is impregnable, for no armed violence may be done in it. A very satisfying arc made more so by the merry collateral tale that interrupts it, which is snappily drawn by Aaron Alexovich (Serenity Rose, 2005), a cuter, cartoonier artist than Fables&#x2019; fine chief limner, Mark Buckingham. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Little Red in the City</h2><p>From innovative designer Ysolda Teague comes Little Red in the City.

But when the Waybournes, the boy's family, refuse to answer the police's questions, Inspector Pitt begins to wonder what secrets they were trying to hide. His wife and helpmeet, Charlotte, is determined to find out--even it if means tearing down the facades of an oh-so-proper family....<br>"The period detail remains fascinating, and [Perry's] grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes."<br>THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the William Monk novels, including <b>Dark Assassin </b>and <b>The Shifting Tide</b>, and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <b>Buckingham Palace Gardens </b>and <b>Long Spoon Lane</b>. She is also the author of the World War I novels <b>No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, Angels in the Gloom, At Some Disputed Barricade,</b> and <b>We Shall Not Sleep</b>, as well as six holiday novels, most recently <b>A Christmas Grace</b>. Anne Perry lives in Scotland.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Perry's Inspector Pitt novels are steeped in a meticulous, if somewhat grim, Victorian atmosphere. In this society, aristocratic parents can flat out refuse to answer police questions when their son's naked, violated body turns up in a London sewer. The frustration felt by the investigating detective as he is thwarted at every turn, not the least by his own superiors, translates to the listener. Add to this the conviction of the wrong person as a cover-up, and the pace seems a bit glacial at times. However, there's no denying Perry's work is true to the time period. And then there's Davina Porter, a performer par excellence. Porter makes the material her own in a way few others can. She gives just the right pitch, accent, and presence to the characters to make them utterly believable. Despite its weight, she moves the story forward and turns in her usual stellar presentation.

The cliffhanger ending might compel many young readers to pick up the next installment in the series, but it fails to satisfy. The dialogue is quick moving to the point of being hard to follow&#x2014;readers may have to double back to catch everything. The black-and-white manga artwork mirrors the breakneck speed of the dialogue. The small scale of the panels, paired with the abrupt jumps in perspective, occasionally leads to confusion.

Rodrigo Borgia-Pope Alexander VI-the first man to have clearly bought himself the papacy, and two of his infamous illegitimate children-Cesare and Lucrezia-were the three central figures of the Borgia dynasty, notorious for seizing power, wealth, land, and titles through bribery, marriage, and murder. Marion Johnson plots the dynasty&#39;s dramatic rise from its beginnings in Spain to its occupation of the highest position in Renaissance society, examining how far the myth of the Borgias is borne out by historical facts. Behind the gaudy horrors, she concludes, lie people of great talent and achievement, possessors, even, of moderate virtues.</p><p>Marian Johnson made her home in Rome in 1944 while working for the British Foreign Office and she soon discovered that the Borgia legend still flourished in the Eternal City.</p><h2>India: A History</h2><p>John Keay&#39;s India: A History is a probing and provocative chronicle of five thousand years of South Asian history, from the first Harrapan settlements on the banks of the Indus River to the recent nuclear-arms race. In a tour de force of narrative history, Keay blends together insights from a variety of scholarly fields and weaves them together to chart the evolution of the rich tapestry of cultures, religions, and peoples that makes up the modern nations of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Authoritative and eminently readable, India: A History is a compelling epic portrait of one of the world&#39;s oldest and most richly diverse civilizations.</p><p>The history of what is now India stretches back thousands of years, further than that of nearly any other region on earth. Yet, observes historian John Keay, most historical work on India concentrates on the period after the arrival of Europeans, with predictable biases, distortions, and misapprehensions. One, for example, is the tendency to locate the source of social conflict in India's many religions--to which Keay retorts, "Historically, it was Europe, not India, which consistently made religion grounds for war."<p> Taking the longest possible view, Keay surveys what is both provable and invented in the historical record. His narrative begins in 3000 B.C., with the complex, and little-understood, Harappan period, a time of state formation and the development of agriculture and trade networks. This period coincides with the arrival of Indo-European invaders, the so-called Aryans, whose name, of course, has been put to bad use at many points since. Keay traces the growth of subsequent states and kingdoms throughout antiquity and the medieval period, suggesting that the lack of unified government made the job of the European conquerors somewhat easier--but by no means inevitable. He continues to the modern day, his narrative ending with Indian-Pakistani conflicts in 1998.</p><p> Fluently told and well documented, Keay's narrative history is of much value to students and general readers with an interest in India's past and present. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>John Keay is a writer, broadcaster and historian whose books include `Into India&#39;, `India Discovered&#39;, `When Men and Mountains Meet&#39;, `Highland Drove&#39;, `The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company&#39;, `The Great Arc&#39;, `China: A History&#39; and (with his wife, Julia Keay) the `Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland&#39;.

(General Fiction)</p><p>I first read this book back in 1984, long before I was in the publishing business. I was traveling through Greece with a friend and our hotel had shelves of books that other guests had left behind and were free for the taking.. I picked up Dinner.... knowing absolutely nothing about it. What a wonderful surprise and discovery!. I felt I had never read anything quite like it.The characters were so real, so familiar that I felt I did actually know them. In fact, for weeks after I finished the book, I had dreams about Ezra, one of the characters in the book and the owner of the Homesick Restaurant. In the dreams, he was my brother and he was just as sweet and vulnerable as he was in the book. I never re-read books because I'm usually disappointed the second time around because the sense of newness and discovery is gone. But I did read Dinner.... again and loved it as much, and even found new things I hadn't noticed before.

And such knowledge should be available to all who sincerely desire it, no matter how messed up, no matter how great their sin or crimes. Neither you nor I want to be among those who are banished from heaven because we were on the wrong path. We should welcome, rather than fear, an examination of our convictions. Christ taught that our eternal destiny is dependent on what we believe and on what we do with those beliefs. So we must approach these questions with an open mind and a willingness to learn and have our convictions challenged. Someday many will have our convictions challenged. Someday many will have to admit ruefully that misplaced faith is worse than no faith at all. The question is not whether a path looks good or even feels right. The question is: Is it God&#39;s way, or is it what I think is God&#39;s way? Stay tuned.

Still, that was his fate one night, and it brings Inspector Barnaby to the scene to investigate. What Barnaby doesn't know is that before his death, Charlie witnessed what might have been the suicide--or murder--of a young woman whose troubles with the law have landed her in the home of a local retired minister and his none-too-pleased wife. Now a man is dead, a girl is missing, and a town is in chaos as long-kept secrets begin to unravel, with deadly repercussions. <br></p><p>Caroline Graham&nbsp;was born in Warwickshire, England. Her first Inspector Barnaby novel, <i>The Killings at Badger's Drift</i>, was selected as one of the Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the Crime Writers' Association.When young and troubled Carlotta disappears from ex-vicar Lionel Lawrence's house, blackmail and murder follow. It's up to Chief Inspector Barnaby to dig through the layers of trouble before more occurs. British writer Graham serves up another of her likable mysteries, which have also been adapted for television. Narrator Hugh Ross, who has read other Graham books featuring Barnaby, has an unusually calm demeanor; this is a reading, rather than a performance. His deliberate style doesn't excite, but it does keep the listener from losing track of the complicated plot. All in all, a comfortingly good listen.

He won his most recent Emmy for his costarring role on Zach Galifianakis&#x2019;s <i>Baskets</i>. <i>Hey Mom</i> is his fourth book.Hey Mom It&#x2019;s About Time<p></p> <br>Hey Mom!<br> <br>I already talk about you a lot but lately I&#x2019;ve been speaking to you directly, too, so I figured it was time I wrote. I often wonder how you&#x2019;re doing. Is there an afterlife? Heaven? That&#x2019;s the million-dollar question. Or billion-dollar question. Or in this day and age, I guess the trillion-dollar question. A million&#x2019;s not even a million anymore. A million was really a million back in your day, Mom.<br> <br>I could say I&#x2019;m writing now to tell you about this great role I got in a great TV show, which just got &#x201c;picked up,&#x201d; in which I play a mom&#x2014;that&#x2019;s right, Mom, a mom, not a dad&#x2014;of four grown sons, and the character is so much like you! Her name is Christine Baskets and playing her comes so naturally because I keep channeling you. What would Mom say? What would Mom do? What would Ora Zella Anderson do?<br> <br>So of course I want to let the inspiration for the character know about it, even if she died a quarter-century ago.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not the only reason I feel the need to write. I have so many questions and so many things I&#x2019;ve been meaning to say to you. Stuff that&#x2019;s on my mind a lot, and I wanted to get it down someplace. There were questions I neglected to ask Dad when he was still around but that&#x2019;s easier to explain. There were so many things he wouldn&#x2019;t talk about. He was angry, an angry alcoholic. Sometimes I just didn&#x2019;t want to be around him, and neither did any of your other ten children.<br> <br>But why didn&#x2019;t I ask you the things I want to ask you now, back when I had the chance? You had no trouble talking, Mom. &#x201c;Blah, blah, blah,&#x201d; Dad said many times about your &#x201c;going on.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m so much more like you than him, in that way. You never yelled or punished or expressed disappointment, only love. Sometimes I wish you&#x2019;d been harder, more disapproving. Maybe you were and I didn&#x2019;t notice. Anyway, it kills me that I didn&#x2019;t ask you a bunch of things I think about more and more these days.<br> <br>I often think about childhood and our family and the things that make us who we are. I&#x2019;ve always thought about that stuff. You know this, Mom, but so much of my comedy act over the years has been based on our family, and you, and what growing up was like. That was a lot of my best material, still is. As a young comic, I mostly made fat jokes at my own expense, or maybe I should say I did lots of fat jokes about this fat character I played onstage (though I played a fat person offstage, too). That was the common denominator. But it&#x2019;s come to be less of my act. Maybe it&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t see myself anymore as a fat person but a person who happens to be fat.<br> <br>Anyway, you were still around when I was doing material about family and it always got laughs, but then I got a little darker and maybe more real with it, and got some of the biggest laughs of the set. A different kind of laugh. It opened up something in me and I started digging. Roman DiCaire, an older comedian I admired and who saw me perform, told me, &#x201c;Louie, if you do that material about your family and have a completely clean act, you&#x2019;ll be famous.&#x201d; I lacked direction then and I was looking for someone to tell me something. He turned out to be 100 percent right. Decades later, Mom, I make jokes about the family, and they land, and land hard, because they&#x2019;re so true for everyone, though I still think our family was way more screwed up than most. &#x201c;A stress test&#x2014;you know what that is? It&#x2019;s where you have your whole family over to the house.&#x201d; Stuff like that often gets the most unguarded laugh of the night.<br> <br>So here I am, Mom, on the verge of basically playing you for a national TV audience, with the pursed lips, the disapproving judgmental glances&#x2014;in the nicest way&#x2014;that I picked up from you. You know that side glance that could say a million things&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t do that, Put that down, What are you doing? Don&#x2019;t make us look bad, Oh, Louie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? That&#x2019;s there.<br> <br>Yet even though I understand some things about you and me, I want to understand more.<br> <br>Which brings me to tonight, Sunday night, this hotel suite desk, in Room 117&#x2014;eleven and seven, two good numbers if you&#x2019;re from Las Vegas, Mom, which is where I now live&#x2014;of the Hilton Garden Inn in Erie, Pennsylvania, having just come from finishing my sixth show in four days (one show Thursday night, two each Friday and Saturday nights, and tonight&#x2019;s), my fifty-eighth comedy set of the year. I&#x2019;m writing to tell you about how it&#x2019;s going, and keeping you even more alive with me. I have so much to report, about so many things, some good stuff, some not so good. But it&#x2019;s a lot, and who knows, maybe one day it will all turn into a book. If it does, I know what I want to call it: Hey Mom, because so many times since you&#x2019;ve been gone I&#x2019;ve looked up and said out loud, &#x201c;Hey Mom, what do you think of this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey Mom, get a load of this guy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey Mom, how&#x2019;d I get into this mess?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey Mom, what am I doing with my life?&#x201d;<br> <br>I think we all do a subconscious &#x201c;Hey Mom&#x201d; a lot of the time. I guess I must believe in the afterlife if I&#x2019;m writing to you and I talk to you and my face is always turned up to the sky. If there is an afterlife, I hope there&#x2019;s a big comfortable chair, because I know you like that, and good creamer for your coffee, and a TV showing old reruns.<br> <br>The last time I had a moment like this, where I absolutely needed to write down what was on my mind, was 1987, when I was touring the Midwest and doing Summerfest in Milwaukee. Thousands and thousands of people were taking in the different acts, drinking beer, eating bratwurst. When my set was over, I wanted to head back to the hotel, so I got a lift from a festival volunteer. I climbed into the back seat of the car&#x2014;a Buick. Mom, you always loved Buicks, such big beautiful cars. All around us were so many drunks wobbling and staggering to their cars, then getting into their cars and trying to avoid hitting other drunks. My first thought was amazement at the inner gyroscope of drunks, how the alcohol takes over and they look like they&#x2019;re going to fall over but somehow they don&#x2019;t&#x2014;amazing! A lot of them, mostly men, made wrestling noises. Ooo! OOOOO!<br> <br>But I had a bigger thought: The whole scene was a metaphor for my life, me swerving and trying to avoid the damage that alcohol did to me, did to all of us, does to all kinds of people. That it did to you, Mom, though you yourself hated to drink. As soon as I got to my room at the Pfister Hotel, a beautiful old hotel in Milwaukee that&#x2019;s supposedly haunted, I sat down at the desk, just like I&#x2019;m doing here with you, and I wrote a letter to Dad. He was already seven years dead at that point, and it all just spilled out of me, letter after letter in my journal, and I kept writing, and crying, in search of some better understanding, any understanding, for why Louis William Anderson was such a cruel, difficult alcoholic father. Those letters eventually got collected into a book, Dear Dad: Letters from an Adult Child, that you got to see, Mom, but just barely, because you died without warning a few months later.<br> <br>Like I said, so much has happened since then, and I want to keep you up-to-date. I wish you had seen the professional success I&#x2019;ve enjoyed in the twenty-five years since you died. You deserve a lot of the credit, partly because I talk so much about you and the family in my act, partly because of the reservoir of love and kindness you doled out to me and to all of us, which gave me the strength to not quit. Because you never quit, never gave up, never gave in, always put one foot in front of the other. In a couple years it will be forty years for me as a stand-up comic. A clown, really, but a clown who&#x2019;s making good money. Can you believe that, Mom? Forty! Anyway, I could not have gotten this far in my career if I gave up easily. Dad was also stubborn. All us Andersons are. We won&#x2019;t give in, we won&#x2019;t give up, we won&#x2019;t even take care of ourselves.<br> <br>There are other things I wish. I wish I would have had you come live with me later in life. I wish I&#x2019;d been more open to the idea. I know you would have adored that. I would have, too, eventually. I was selfish then, much more than I think&#x2014;I hope&#x2014;I am now. I wish I would have done it and I&#x2019;m glad to say it here even though it&#x2019;s too late. I also know we have to let go of regrets or it drags us through the mud for all the things we didn&#x2019;t do.<br> <br>I need to tell you about the family&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s late and I&#x2019;m wiped out from the show, so I&#x2019;ll say good night for now. I&#x2019;ll write tomorrow.<br> <br>Love,<br> <br>Louie</p><h2>The Sandcastle Girls: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>The Sandcastle Girls</i></b> is a sweeping historical love story steeped in Chris Bohjalian's Armenian heritage.<br>When Elizabeth Endicott arrives in Aleppo, Syria she has a diploma from Mount Holyoke, a crash course in nursing,&nbsp; and only the most basic grasp of the Armenian language.&nbsp; The year is 1915 and she has volunteered on behalf of the Boston-based Friends of Armenia to help deliver food and medical aid to refugees of the Armenian genocide.&nbsp; There Elizabeth becomes friendly with Armen, a young Armenian engineer who has already lost his wife and infant daughter.&nbsp; When Armen leaves Aleppo and travels south into Egypt to join the British army, he begins to write Elizabeth letters, and comes to realize that he has fallen in love with the wealthy, young American woman who is so different from the wife he lost.<br>Fast forward to the present day, where we meet Laura Petrosian, a novelist living in suburban New York.&nbsp; Although her grandparents' ornate Pelham home was affectionately nicknamed "The Ottoman Annex," Laura has never really given her Armenian heritage much thought.

The men are detouring around the square near the base of the citadel because they don&#x2019;t yet want her to see the deportees who arrived here last night--there will be time for that soon enough--but she fears she is going to be sick anyway. The smell of rotting flesh, excrement, and the July heat are conspiring to churn her stomach far worse than even the trip across the Atlantic had weeks earlier. She feels clammy and weak-kneed and reaches out for her father&#x2019;s elbow to steady herself. Her father, in turn, gently taps her fingers with his hand, his vague and abstracted attempt at a comforting gesture.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Endicott, do you need to rest? You look a little peaked,&#x201d; the consul says, and she glances at him. His brown eyes are wide and a little crazed, and already there are thin rivulets of sweat running down both sides of his face. He is wearing a beige linen jacket, which she imagines to be infinitely more comfortable than her father&#x2019;s gray woolen suit. She brings her free hand to her own face and feels the moisture there. She nods in response to his question; she does need to sit, though it embarrasses her to admit this. Still, it may be a nonissue. She can&#x2019;t see where she might on this squalid street. But Ryan quickly takes her arm and guides her from her father, leading her to a stoop on the shady side of the thin road. He wipes off the squat step with his bare hand. There is a ramshackle wooden door behind the stoop, shut tight against the midmorning heat, but she presumes that whoever lives there won&#x2019;t mind if she sits. And so there she rests and breathes in deeply and slowly through her mouth, watching the women in their headscarves and long, loose robes--some hide all but their eyes behind burqas--and the men in their ornate blazers, their voluminous, shapeless trousers, and their flowerpot-like fez hats. Some of the men glance at her sympathetically as they pass, others with a brazen want in their eyes. She has been warned.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nice breeze today,&#x201d; Ryan says cheerfully, and while she appreciates the slightly cooler air, wafting along with it is the stench from the square. &#x201c;Before you arrived, the heat was just unbearable.&#x201d;<br><br>She can&#x2019;t imagine it being hotter. At the moment, she can&#x2019;t imagine anywhere being hotter. And yet she found their apartment last night unexpectedly comfortable after the endless weeks aboard a ship, then a horse-drawn carriage, and finally two train cars that boasted only wooden seats. It was warm, but she had stood at her window for nearly half an hour in the middle of the night, gazing out at the row of statuesque cypress on the hill beyond the American compound and the bower of trees just inside the walls. She saw more stars than she ever saw in Boston, and the half moon seemed to dangle eerily, beautifully close to the earth.<br><br>Her father is surveying the rows of sand-colored two-story buildings that curl toward an alley, his arms folded across his chest, his face stern, and then she notes him arch his back suddenly and stand up a little straighter. Ryan sees what he sees and murmurs just loud enough for her to hear, &#x201c;Oh, Jesus, no. Not more.&#x201d; Both Ryan and her father glance down at her, but they realize there is absolutely nothing they can do; there is not a way in the world to shield her from what is coming. Besides, this is why she is here, isn&#x2019;t it? Didn&#x2019;t she volunteer to be a part of this aid mission? To chronicle what she sees for their organization, the Friends of Armenia, and to volunteer at the hospital--to do, in essence, whatever she could to help? Still, discomfort leaches from both men like perspiration, and she finds it interesting that they are as embarrassed as they are disgusted. If they had been here alone--if she had remained back at the American compound--her father and the American consul now would be experiencing only rage. And so she presses the palm of her hand against the wall of the house, the stone unexpectedly cool, and rises.<br><br>Approaching from down the street is a staggering column of old women, and she is surprised to observe they are African. She stares, transfixed. She thinks of the paintings and drawings she has seen of American slave markets in the South from the 1840s and 1850s, though weren&#x2019;t those women and men always clothed--if only in rags? These women are completely naked, bare from their feet to the long drapes of matted black hair. And it is the hair, long and straight though filthy and impossibly tangled, that causes her to understand that these women are white--at least they were once--and they are, in fact, not old at all. Many might be her age or even a little younger. All are beyond modesty, beyond caring. Their skin has been seared black by the sun or stained by the soil in which they have slept or, in some cases, by great yawning scabs and wounds that are open and festering and, even at this distance, malodorous. The women look like dying wild animals as they lurch forward, some holding on to the walls of the stone houses to remain erect. She has never in her life seen people so thin and wonders how in the name of God their bony legs can support them. Their breasts are lost to their ribs. The bones of their hips protrude like baskets.<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth, you don&#x2019;t need to watch,&#x201d; her father is saying, but she does. She does.<br><br>Herding the women forward through the town are half a dozen young men, two on horseback who look nearly as weak as the women, and four walking beside the group. All of them have rifles slung over their shoulders. They, too, don&#x2019;t look any older than Elizabeth, and it crosses her mind that the pair nearest her can&#x2019;t be more than fifteen or sixteen; their moustaches are wisps, a boy&#x2019;s attempt to look like a man.<br><br>Just before the group reaches them, the gendarmes guide the women down the narrow street that will lead eventually to the square beneath the citadel, where they will be deposited with the deportees who arrived here yesterday. The men are short-tempered and tired. They strike the women when they move slowly or clumsily. They yank them back to their feet by their hair when they collapse. Elizabeth tries to count the women as they turn to the right and disappear into the alley, but reflexively she looks away whenever one of the skeletons meets her eye. Still, she guesses there are at least 125 of them. She verbalizes the number aloud without thinking.<br><br>&#x201c;I assure you, Miss Endicott,&#x201d; says Ryan, &#x201c;when that group left Zeitun or Adana or wherever, there were at least a thousand of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did the Turks take their clothes?&#x201d; she asks him.<br><br>He shakes his head. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t usually--unless they&#x2019;re planning to kill them. Sometimes they take the men&#x2019;s clothes immediately before executing them; they worry the clothes of the dead are defiled. But I have no idea why they did in this case. Degrade the survivors, maybe. Perhaps increase the chances they&#x2019;ll die on their own in the sun. But don&#x2019;t look for reason in any of this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And where are the men?&#x201d;<br><br>He dabs at his forehead with a handkerchief. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s safe to assume they&#x2019;re dead. Either they were--&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t finish because her father glares at the consul to be silent. To be still. Her father is hoping to introduce her to this world gradually. In increments. They discussed it little on either the ship or the train. Generalities of Ottoman history only.<br><br>Later this month, the two doctors in their party will arrive and they will start work. They--along with a returning missionary named Alicia Wells--telegrammed that their ship was going to be delayed leaving Boston, and might then take a more roundabout course to avoid U-boats. But whether the physicians are delayed two weeks or three might make all the difference in the world for some of the survivors who are brought here. These women, she presumes, will be long gone by then, marched back into the desert to one of the resettlement camps to the southeast. So will the group that is already in the square, the women and children who staggered in from the desert yesterday.<br><br>In the meantime, Elizabeth can&#x2019;t imagine what in the name of God she--what anyone--can do for them. Still, after catching her breath, she and her father and the American consul decide that instead of spending lunch discussing the conditions in Aleppo and planning for the arrival of the rest of their group, they will follow these woeful deportees down the alley and into the square, and there see what they can do to help.<br><br>Ryan Martin leaves to find rags for the women to wear, but by the time he returns with a wagon of tattered dresses and blouses--remnants from the dead who have passed through Aleppo that summer--the newly arrived deportees already have been clothed by the other refugees. In the meantime, Elizabeth and a nurse from the hospital pick at the vermin on the women and clean the gaping wounds on their legs and ankles and feet. They ration the little calamine lotion and olive oil they have for those women whose sunburns have not seared deep into their flesh, and gently wash the wounds of those whose skin--especially on their shoulders and backs--has peeled off like a snake&#x2019;s. Within minutes they finish off the one large bottle of iodine the nurse has brought. Elizabeth gives the deportees water and bowls of thin bulgur soup to eat, because it is all they can scare up at the moment. There may be bread tomorrow. She feels helpless. When she was given her nursing training back in Boston, no one prepared her for dysentery. For gangrene. For feet with bones splintered from weeks of walking barefoot, the toes and heels swollen and mangled and deformed.<br><br>Most of the women are clustered underneath makeshift tents--canvas pulled tight on tottering wooden poles--but there are more women than there is room, so they spread out beyond the tent when the sun is no longer overhead and there are long stripes of comforting black shade. The children--among whom the only males in this new group can be found--remind her of dead sea horses she once saw on the beach at Cape Cod: The children, like the sea horses, are curled up on their sides and their bones seem as brittle and sharp as the shells of the dried pipefish. Perhaps a quarter mile away is a hospital, primitive by Boston standards, but a hospital nonetheless. It infuriates Elizabeth that there is, apparently, no room for these women there, and so far not a single doctor has emerged from the building and offered to help. Ryan has tried to mollify her by telling her that the vast majority of the beds there are filled with Armenian women and children, but this reality too has left her seething inside.<br><br>The number of deportees who speak either English or French surprises Elizabeth, though most are too tired right now to talk. Nevertheless, there is a woman who looks to be in her fifties but Elizabeth suspects is actually half that age, who murmurs &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; in English as she takes the bowl of soup and brings it to her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Elizabeth says. &#x201c;I wish it were a more substantial meal.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman shrugs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re American,&#x201d; she observes, a statement. She is wearing a man&#x2019;s shirt and a skirt that balloons around her like a sack.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. My name is Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Nevart,&#x201d; the Armenian offers, and Elizabeth carefully rolls the name around in her mind. A small girl sleeps beside the woman, the child&#x2019;s collarbone rising and falling ever so slightly with each breath. Elizabeth guesses that she is seven or eight. &#x201c;Where in America?&#x201d; Nevart asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Boston,&#x201d; Elizabeth answers. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the state of Massachusetts.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s nails are as brown as her skin. &#x201c;Sip that soup slowly,&#x201d; she adds.<br><br>Nevart nods and places the bowl in her lap. &#x201c;I know where Boston is,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I heard you speaking Armenian a minute ago. How much do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little. Very little, actually. I know mostly vocabulary. I know words, not grammar.&#x201d; Then Elizabeth asks the woman, &#x201c;How did you learn English?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My husband went to college in London. He was a doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth thinks about this, imagining this wraith of a woman living in England. As if Nevart can read her mind, the deportee continues, &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t with him most of the time. I have been to London, but only for a visit.&#x201d; She sighs and looks into Elizabeth&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to die,&#x201d; she murmurs, and she almost sounds disappointed.<br><br>&#x201c;No, of course, you won&#x2019;t. I know that.&#x201d; Elizabeth hopes she sounds reassuring. She honestly isn&#x2019;t sure whether this woman will live.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that.

Like me, she is unkillable.&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth wants to ask about the woman&#x2019;s husband, but she doesn&#x2019;t dare. The man is almost certainly dead. Likewise, she wonders if Nevart has lost her children as well, but again she knows no good can come from this inquiry. Wouldn&#x2019;t the Armenian have said something about her own children if they were with her now--if they were alive?<br><br>Over the woman&#x2019;s shoulder Elizabeth spies her father in the distance. He is ladling out the soup from a black cauldron and handing it to the women strong enough to stand and bring it to those who are collapsed under the tent. His sideburns and his beard, so much thicker and grayer than the thin whorls of cinnamon atop his scalp, look almost white in this light. They are expecting flour and sugar and tea in the next day or so--the first of two shipments they have arranged this month--though Ryan has warned her father and her that it is likely only a small fraction of what they have acquired will actually arrive in Aleppo.<br><br>&#x201c;Where do we go next?&#x201d; Nevart asks her. &#x201c;They brought us here, but they won&#x2019;t let us stay.&#x201d;</p><h2>Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible</h2><p>This stand-alone, in-depth reference work is the culmination of the author&#39;s thirty-plus years of study, teaching, and research.

His great-�grandfather was Augustus II, king of Poland; and his grandfather was Maurice de Koenigsmark, later called the Mar�chal de Saxe when he was the most exalted field marshal in Napoleon&#x2019;s army. This mar�chal was renowned not only for his cunning and bravery upon the battlefield but for a particular kind of bonhomie he demonstrated in war. For instance, he commonly arranged for women and theater for himself and his men to enjoy after a good day of battle&#x2014;�never, he believed, would they appreciate such things more. All of France knew his name.</p><p>And so it was in my father&#x2019;s blood, his great love of the military, and he joined the army in 1798, when he was twenty years old, never mind his mother twisting her handkerchief. Two years later, he was transferred to Milan, Italy, as an aide-�de-�camp, and it was there that he met my mother.</p><p>She was Antoinette-�Sophie-�Victoire Delaborde, called Sophie, a courtesan currently living with a general who&#x2019;d been smitten by her great beauty, her passion, and her gaiety. As was my father. He stole her away from the general, apparently with little ill will, for he was later promoted.</p><p>In many letters written to his mother at this time, my father spoke of his love for his fine mistress, and my grandmother worried and fretted, frightened to death that her son might marry someone so far beneath him. She knew that my mother was four years older than Maurice and of a lower class, born to a poor man who sold songbirds on the quays of the Seine, and that in addition to working as a camp follower, she had a young daughter. It was not the match my grandmother had in mind for her beloved son.</p><p>There was in this no small measure of hypocrisy. My grandmother may have had illustrious aristocrats in her family, but she came from a long line of illegitimate births, including her father&#x2019;s. And she herself was illegitimate&#x2014;�her mother, ironically, was a courtesan who had captured the Mar�chal de Saxe&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>My father went on to distinguish himself in battle, as his grandfather had, but then he was captured by the enemy and held for two months as a prisoner of war. In May 1801, after his release, he returned home to my grandmother at Nohant. His normally buoyant personality had changed; he had about him an air of melancholy. One would expect such a change after a man is subjected to the ills of imprisonment&#x2014;�vile treatment, near starvation, and only straw upon the ground for a bed. Add to this the mental distress of my father coming to understand that he was perhaps not destined always to be lucky, as he had often told his mother&#x2014;�he was as vulnerable as anyone else. But what beleaguered my father most in those days was the thought that he would have to choose between two women, both of whom he loved.</p><p>My grandmother had been my father&#x2019;s only parent since, when he was nine years old, his father died, leaving the little family enough of a fortune that my grandmother had a comfortable yearly income. In 1793, when the eleven months of the Reign of Terror began and the ruling Jacobins were ordering mass executions by guillotine in order to compel obedience to the state, she had fled her apartment in Paris and bought a peaceful country estate 150 miles south of the city. It was in the Berry region, a gently hilly, largely agricultural area of central France, and the estate lay just outside the little village of Nohant-�Vic, population 272. Nohant was situated between the larger towns of Ch�teauroux and La Ch�tre.</p><p>The house itself, done in the style of Louis XVI, was commodious without being ostentatious. It had once been the site of a fourteenth-�century feudal castle, and the bell tower still stood, its dusty, tile-�lined belfry serving as a gathering place for doves. On the estate&#x2019;s acreage were the smaller houses of peasants, tenant farmers who worked the land. With its fields, expansive gardens, acres of forests, and the Indre River running through it, it was a beautiful place in which to grow up.</p><p>In the absence of his own father, my father displayed toward his mother the protective attitude that is understandable in such situations. Their correspondence to each other revealed a mutual affection and appreciation as well as a deep level of trust; and oftentimes the language my father used in expressing his longing to see his mother bordered more than a little on the romantic.</p><p>But Sophie! Literally from the time my father first saw her, he was obsessed with her. He had had plenty of opportunities to delight in the charms of highborn, beautiful, and cultured women. Sophie offered something different, something more. He&#x2014;�and many others, I might add&#x2014;�found her irresistible. The more time he spent with her, the more his love intensified.</p><p>After he&#x2019;d been released from prison, my father had gone to see Sophie in Paris. At that time, she was again living with a general, but she begged my father to take her with him when he went back to Nohant. Because he was at that point a penniless soldier (he did not then or ever like to rely upon his mother for his support), she even offered to lend him money to fund the trip. My father&#x2019;s response was that my mother should think carefully and without his influence about whether she truly wanted to be with him, leaving behind a man who kept her in a manner most comfortable. My father&#x2019;s charm would not buy bread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took almost no time for my mother to make her decision: she elected to throw in her lot with my father, the man she truly loved. And so the two of them set out for Nohant.</p><p>My father had a plan: rather than introducing the two women right away, he would set Sophie up three miles away in La Ch�tre, at an inn called the T�te Noire. When the time was right, he would make the introduction.</p><p>After he spent a few days at Nohant, my father began disappearing for long stretches of time, telling his mother he was visiting relatives. But she suspected he was seeing a woman and finally confronted her son.</p><p>My father admitted that it was Sophie he was seeing, that he was keeping her at the inn. He said, &#x201c;She has sacrificed everything in order to be with me. I am full of gratitude toward her, full of joy that she has chosen to be by my side.&#x201d;</p><p>My grandmother&#x2019;s feelings were hardly the same. Bosom heaving, lace cockade trembling at the top of her head, she told her son that she refused to meet Sophie. She berated him for the scandal such a woman&#x2019;s presence would cause and requested that he immediately send Sophie back to Paris, without him.</p><p>&#x201c;For so many long days and nights I turned away food, I could not sleep, for worry about you,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I rejoiced that when you came home on leave you would be with me until you had to return to the service. Now even when you are with me, you are not; your thoughts are always with her. Please, I beg you, send her away; give yourself time to think carefully about your future!&#x201d;</p><p>My father&#x2019;s response was uncharacteristically strident. &#x201c;You ask me to turn her away as though she were a vulgar mistress, when I tell you over and over again that in fact I adore her! Was it not you who made me an acolyte of Jean-�Jacques Rousseau, who said that we are all born good and capable of self-�improvement? Have you not all your life taught me to appreciate the noble attributes of people regardless of their class?&#x201d;</p><p>My grandmother only stared at him, helpless to explain the difference between what is in a mother&#x2019;s head and what is in her heart.</p><p>They went round and round, each wounded, each hoping the other would come to understand their version of the irrefutable truth. The dinner table, once gay with stories and laughter, was now all but silent, the clinking of silverware and the murmur of the servants the only sounds.</p><p>It was Jean-�Fran�ois Des�chartres who finally resolved the issue in a bold move, one that came with dire consequences.</p><p>Des�chartres was my father&#x2019;s tutor. He was a secularized cleric, having studied for the priesthood without being ordained, and he was under my grandmother&#x2019;s employ. He was inordinately devoted to both my father and her.</p><p>He was an odd man, very thin and tall, pale of skin and eye. He kept his tonsured hairstyle, and he favored wearing knee breeches and stockings and yellow gaiters. In cold weather, he always wore the same ancient brown coat. He had a stutter that was more pronounced when he was nervous, and he was occasionally excitable in the way of an old woman. He had, too, an air of perpetual distractibility, as though he held the Almighty in one hand and you in the other and could never quite decide to whom he should give his complete attention.</p><p>But Des�chartres was also highly intelligent, an expert in teaching a great variety of subjects. He had no understanding of love or passion, however. He looked upon such emotions as something that must be tolerated in his fellow human beings, a kind of tic of personality he felt fortunate not to be burdened by.</p><p>Hearing the arguments between my father and my grandmother must have distressed Des�chartres greatly; he had never before seen them behave toward each other in this way. And so early one morning, while the rest of the household was asleep, he went to see Sophie. He intended to persuade her, for the good of all, to leave immediately.</p><p>He picked a bouquet of flowers before he left, and on the ride over, he practiced in his mind what he would say to her. When he got to the inn, he quickly climbed the stairs to her room and knocked at the door.</p><p>No response.</p><p>He knocked again, loudly now, and heard a low voice, sweet in tone, say, &#x201c;Maurice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is I, Fran�ois Des�chartres, Maurice&#x2019;s tutor.&#x201d; He felt a sudden rush of blood to his head, an outbreak of perspiration. He wiped his upper lip and leaned forward to speak authoritatively into the crack of the door. &#x201c;I have come with an important message for you.&#x201d; He put his ear to the crack to listen for her response and heard Sophie walk quickly across the floor. There were sounds of rapid dressing, and then she flung open the door.</p><p>Upon seeing her, Des�chartres was at first speechless: she had been sleeping, and there was a soft pink flush to the cheeks of her heart-�shaped face. Her eyes were wide and dark and very beautiful, direct in their gaze. She was barefoot, and her black hair was not done up but loose around her face, cascading over her shoulders. Her bosom was ample, her waist narrow, and she had about her an air of sultry grace.</p><p>He asked if he might come in.</p><p>&#x201c;Bien s�r,&#x201d; she said, most pleasantly, and stepped aside to let him pass. She was very small in stature, and it must have given even dry-�souled Des�chartres pause to think about delivering such a stern directive to one so tiny.</p><p>He offered her the bouquet, and she took it without looking at it. &#x201c;Has something happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only this,&#x201d; Des�chartres said. &#x201c;Your presence here has made for a great rift in the relationship between Maurice and his mother, whom, as you must know, he loves more than any person on earth. Every day they argue bitterly, and I can tell you most assuredly that this is not their way; they have always been unusually close. I have come to ask you to go back to Paris. Maurice says you love him; what better way can you prove it than to spare him the terrible pain you are now causing him? Give him distance, give him time, do not subject him any longer to such terrible strain, especially when he has so recently been freed from prison. Surely, without any need for elaboration, you can see that you are not meant for each other. He is in need of peace and care and quiet. Now, if you will kindly collect your things, I shall arrange&#x2014;�&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Out of my sight, you fool!&#x201d; Sophie cried, flinging the bouquet to the floor. &#x201c;Go back to kissing the withered feet of your benefactress! Do not spoil Maurice&#x2019;s and my happiness with such a ridiculous demand. Do you imagine that I do not know what Maurice needs now? You may rest assured it is not his mother!&#x201d;</p><p>And then, small as she was, she forced Des�chartres from the room, slamming and locking the door after him.</p><p>An outraged Des�chartres knocked again and again, to no avail. Finally, he said, &#x201c;Have it your way, then, ignorant girl! You leave me with no choice but to call upon the authorities. Then we shall see how long you stay here spinning your web! You are a common prostitute, rightfully worthless in the eyes of respectable people, and you do not belong here!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave this pedestrian place all right,&#x201d; Sophie shouted. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll take Maurice with me, you&#x2019;ll see! You have no idea how much he loves me. Every day, he begs me to marry him! I&#x2019;ll take him with me and we will never return!&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Medieval Feast</h2><p><p>The King is coming to visit!

Her talent for drawing, first recognized by her kindergarten teacher, was encouraged by her parents and other teachers she will never forget.<p></p><p>After graduating from the Philadelphia College of Art, she started a career in advertising art. She married Franz Brandenberg and lived in Switzerland for three years, where she wrote and illustrated her first book, <i>The Story of William Tell</i>.</p><p>After they moved to New York, she wrote <i>My Five Senses</i>, the book that changed her career and her life. Besides her own books, Aliki has illustrated many by other authors, including Franz. Their children, Jason and Alexa, who have artistic careers of their own, appear in many of Aliki's books as cats, mice, or themselves.</p><p>Aliki loves music, theater, films, museums, reading, and digging in her garden in London, where she lives. She travels frequently to the United States, Greece, Switzerland, and other countries, many of which are reflected in her books.</p>NOTES FROM ALIKI<p>0nce, when I was reading one of my books to Jason, who was just learning words, I asked him, "What is my name?" He said, "Byaliki." I laughed. But in many ways I am a bi-Aliki. Greek and American. Bilingual. Author and illustrator. Writer of fiction and nonfiction-books that come from inside out (feeling books), and outside in (research books).</p><p>I had no thought of becoming a writer until it happened. But early on, I developed a lifelong habit of writing down my feelings. I realized it helped me understand my hurt, anger, bewilderment, or happiness. Words flowed out into poetry, letters, and journals. It was practice for later on.</p><p>I wrote <i>The Two of Them</i> when my father died. I wrote <i>We Are Best Friends</i> when we moved from New York to London. I wrote about my childhood seaside vacations in <i>Those Summers</i>. In fact, it was on one such family vacation that I was born unexpectedly (in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey -- but we never lived there)!</p><p><i>Marianthe's Story</i>, two books in one volume, is very much my own. In one of its two parts -- Painted Words -- Mari is lucky to have such an understanding teacher and the ability to express herself through pictures (as was 1). In Spoken Memories, the villagers are composites of family and friends, and the voice is often my grandmother's. She cared passionately about education and passed it on to us.</p><p><i>All by Myself!</i> -- snapped after watching my nephew Peter, who was just learning to dress himself. We can take nothing for granted. All skills -- from the simplest to the most complicated -- are learned. They take patience, perseverance, and determination. With some, a little talent helps. Life is one big challenge. I'm still trying to learn to swim.</p><p>My research books come from a fascination with a subject I know only a glimmer about. It can take three years to read, delve, dig, write, and repeat the process for the illustrations. It can be torture, because Virgos don't like to make mistakes.</p><p>To write <i>My Visit to the Aquarium,</i> I visited eleven aquariums -- the most fun research ever. But then I had to get the right fish into the right tank. <i>My Visit to the Zoo</i> was even harder. Nine zoos, hundreds of books, magazines, and related matter. And with all due respect to the author, the illustrator has twice the work. I call it hard fun.</p><p>All books -- read or made -- change lives. None more than <i>William Shakespeare &amp; the Globe</i>. I was challenged by wanting to compress 40.0 years into 38 pages, to tell (in words and pictures) a story that comes full circle. It didn't help that we know very little about Shakespeare the man. But I was enveloped by his words -- which brought him to life. When I finally finished, the pain of loss -- which lasted months -- was like parting from a beloved friend.</p></p><h2>A Creed in Stone Creek (The Creed Cowboys)</h2><p><br><br>When single attorney Steven Creed becomes guardian of an orphaned five-year-old boy, he trades his big-city law firm for a ranch near his McKettrick kin in the close-knit community of Stone Creek, Arizona.

One by one, the mental tumblers clicked into place:<br><br>Room 6. Happy Wanderer Motel and Campground.

A bundle&#x2014;probably his favorite toy, a plush skunk named Fred, rolled up in his blanket&#x2014;rested beside him, and the boy's tiny frame was rimmed in an aura of silvery-gold moonlight.<br><br>Something tightened in Steven's throat at the poignancy of the sight.<br><br>Poor kid. It wasn't hard to guess who he was waiting for.

That they wouldn't be coming to pick him up, no matter how hard he hoped or how many stars he wished on, that night or any other.<br><br>Steven's eyes burned, and he had to swallow the hard ache that rose in his throat.<br><br>Jillie had succumbed to a particularly virulent form of breast cancer a year and a half ago, and Zack had only lasted a few months before the grief dragged him under, too&#x2014;however indirectly.<br><br>"Hey, Tex," Steven said, trying to sound casual as he sat up on the thin, lumpy mattress of the foldout sofa&#x2014; he'd given the bed to the child when they checked in that evening. Steven shoved a hand through his own dark blond hair. "What's the trouble?" His voice was hoarse. "Can't sleep?"<br><br>Matt looked back at him, shook his head instead of answering aloud.<br><br>He looked even smaller than usual, sitting there in the expanse of that wide-open doorway.<br><br>Steven rolled out of bed, shirtless and barefoot, wearing a pair of black sweatpants that had seen better days.<br><br>He crossed the scuffed linoleum floor, stepped over the threshold and sat down beside Matt on the step, interlacing his fingers, letting his elbows rest on his knees. There was enough of a chill in the air to raise goose bumps wherever his skin was bare, so he figured Matt had to be cold, too, sitting there in his cotton pajamas. With a sigh, Steven squinted to make out the winding sparkle of the nearby creek, sprinkled in starlight, edged by oak trees, with night-purple mountains for a backdrop.<br><br>Matt leaned into him a little, a gesture that further melted Steven's already-bruised heart.<br><br>Carefully, Steven put an arm around the boy, to lend not only reassurance, but warmth, too. "Having second thoughts about turning rancher this late in your life?" he teased, thinking he couldn't have loved Matt any more if he'd been his own child, instead of his best friend's.<br><br>In the morning, Steven would attend the closing over at the Cattleman's Bank, and sign the papers making him the legal owner of a fifty-acre spread with a sturdy though run-down two-story house and a good well but not much else going for it. The rickety fences had toppled over years ago, defeated by decades of heavy snow in winter and pounding rain come springtime, and the barn was unsalvageable. Yet something about the place had reached out to him and grabbed hold, just the same.<br><br>The small ranch had been a home once, and it could be one again, with a lot of elbow grease&#x2014;and a serious chunk of change. Fortunately, money wasn't a problem for Steven, which wasn't to say there weren't plenty of other things to chap his figurative hide.<br><br>Sometimes, he felt just as lost as Matt did.<br><br>Matt's mouth quirked up at one side in a flimsy attempt at a smile, all the more touching because of the obvious effort involved. "I'm <em>only </em>five years and three months old," he said, in belated reply to Steven's question, in that oddly mature way of his. "It's not late in my life, because my life just got <em>started." </em>The little guy had skipped the baby-talk stage entirely; he hadn't even <em>tried </em>to talk until he was past two, but he'd spoken in full sentences from then on.<br><br>"Five, huh?" Steven teased, raising one eyebrow. "If you weren't so short, I'd say you were lying about your age. Come on, admit it&#x2014;you're really somebody's grandfather, posing as a kid."<br><br>The joke, a well-worn favorite, fell flat. Matt's small shoulders moved with the force of his sigh, and he leaned a little more heavily into Steven's side.<br><br>"Feeling lonesome?" Steven asked, after clearing his throat.<br><br>Matt nodded, looking up at Steven. His eyes were huge and luminous in the predawn darkness. "I need a dog," the boy announced solemnly.<br><br>Steven chuckled, ruffled Matt's hair, gleaming dark as a raven's wing in the night. Relief swelled inside him, flailed behind his chest wall like a living thing doing its best to escape. A dog was something he could manage.<br><br>"Soon as we're settled," he promised, "we'll visit the animal shelter and pick out a mutt."<br><br>"Do they have ponies at the shelter, too?" The question cheered Steven; Matt was pushing the envelope, so to speak, and that had to be a good sign.<br><br>They'd already had the pony discussion&#x2014;repeatedly.<br><br>"You know the deal, Tex," he reminded the little boy quietly. "The fences need to be replaced before we can keep horses, and the barn, too."<br><br>Matt sighed again, deeply. "That might take a long time," he lamented, "since you'll be working in town every day."<br><br>Steven fully intended to settle down in Stone Creek, build a normal life for his young charge and for himself. And to him, <em>normal </em>meant showing up somewhere on weekday mornings and putting in eight hours&#x2014;whether he needed the paycheck or not.<br><br>He'd had to fight just to get through high school, let alone prelaw in college, and then earn the graduate degree that had qualified him to take the bar exam&#x2014;a frustrating variety of learning disorders had all but crippled him early in his life. Although they'd been corrected, thanks to several perceptive teachers, he'd had a lot of catching up to do.<br><br>Still felt as if he was scrambling, some of the time.<br><br>Steven ruffled Matt's hair. "Yep," he agreed. "I'll be working."<br><br>"What about me? Where will I be when you're gone?"<br><br>They'd already covered that ground, numerous times, but after everything&#x2014;and everybody&#x2014;the little guy had lost over the past couple of years, it wasn't surprising that he needed almost constant reassurance. "You'll be in day camp," Steven said. "Until you start first grade in the fall, anyhow."<br><br>Matt's chin jutted out a little way, the angle obstinate and so reminiscent of Zack that the backs of Steven's eyes stung again. Zack St. John had been his best friend since middle school, a popular athlete, excellent student and all-around good guy. Losing Jillie had been a terrible blow, knocking Zack for the proverbial loop&#x2014;he'd gone wild and finally died when, driving too fast down a narrow mountain road, he'd lost control somehow and laid his motorcycle down.<br><br>"Couldn't I just go to the office with you?" the boy asked, his voice even smaller than he was. "I might not like day camp. Anyhow, it's summer. Who goes to day camp in <em>summer?</em>"<br><br>Steven sighed and got to his feet. "Lots of kids do," he said. "And you might just wind up thinking day camp is the greatest thing since 3D TV." He extended a hand. "Come on, Tex. Let's get you back to bed. Tomorrow might be a long day, and you'll need your rest."<br><br>Matt reached for the stuffed skunk, and wound up in the now-tattered blanket he always kept close at hand. Jillie had knitted that herself, especially to bring her and Zack's infant son home from the hospital in, but the thing had been through some serious wear-and-tear since then.<br><br>Steven supposed that Matt was too old to be so attached to a baby blanket, but he didn't have the heart to take it away.<br><br>So he watched as the little boy got to his feet, trundled back inside, took a brief detour to the bathroom and then stood in the middle of the small room, looking forlorn.<br><br>"Can I sleep with you?" he asked. "Just for tonight?"<br><br>Steven tossed back the covers on the sofa bed and stretched out, resigned to the knowledge that he probably wouldn't close his eyes again before the morning was right on top of him. "Yeah," he said. "Hop in."<br><br>Matt scrambled onto the bad mattress and squirmed a little before settling down.<br><br>Steven stretched to switch off the lamp on the bedside table.<br><br>"Thanks," Matt said, in the darkness.<br><br>"You're welcome," Steven replied.<br><br>"I dreamed about Mom and Dad," Matt confided, after a silence so long that Steven thought he'd gone to sleep. "They were coming to get me, in a big red truck. That's why I was sitting on the step when you woke up. It took me a little while to figure out that it was just a dream."<br><br>"I thought it was something like that," Steven said, when he could trust himself to speak.<br><br>"I really miss them," Matt admitted.<br><br>"Me, too," Steven agreed, his voice hoarse.<br><br>"But we're gonna make it, right? You and me? Because we're pardners till the end?"<br><br>Steven swallowed, blinked a couple of times, glad of the darkness. "Pardners till the end," he promised. "And we are definitely gonna make it."<br><br>"Okay," Matt yawned, apparently satisfied. For the moment, anyhow. He'd ask again soon. "'Night."<br><br>"'Night," Steven replied.<br><br>Soon, the child was asleep.<br><br>Eventually, though he would have bet it wouldn't happen, Steven slept, too.<br><br>Melissa O'Ballivan whipped her prized convertible roadster, cherry-red with plenty of gleaming chrome, up to the curb in front of the Sunflower Bakery and Cafe in downtown Stone Creek, shifted into Neutral and shoved open the door to jump out.<br><br>It was a nice day, one of those blue-sky wonders, so she had the top down.<br><br>Setting the emergency brake and then leaving the engine running, she dashed into the small restaurant, owned and operated by her brother-in-law Tanner Quinn's sister, Tessa, and made her way between jam-packed tables to the counter.<br><br>Six days a week, Melissa breakfasted on fruit smoothies with a scoop of protein powder blended in, but most Fridays, she permitted herself to stop by the popular eatery for her favorite takeout&#x2014;Tessa made a mean turkey-sausage biscuit with cheese and egg whites.<br><br>"The usual?" Tessa grinned at her from behind the counter, but she was already holding up the fragrant brown paper bag.<br><br>Melissa returned the cheerful greetings of several other customers and nodded, fishing in her wallet for money as she reached the register. Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a face she didn't recognize&#x2014;a good-looking guy with dark blond hair, a little on the shaggy side, perched on one of the stools in front of the counter. He wore black slacks and an expensive sports shirt that accented the periwinkle-blue of his eyes.<br><br>For some reason Melissa couldn't have explained, she was suddenly picturing him in old jeans, beat-up boots and the kind of Western-cut shirt most of the men around Stone Creek wore for every day.<br><br>She looked away quickly&#x2014;but not quickly enough, going by the slight grin that tugged at a corner of the stranger's mouth as he studied her. Who <em>was </em>this? Melissa wondered, while she waited impatiently for Tessa to hand back change for a ten-dollar bill.<br><br>Just somebody passing through, she decided, completing the transaction and noticing, somewhat after the fact, that the mystery man wasn't alone. A small boy sat beside him, busily tucking into a short stack of Tessa's incomparable blueberry-walnut pancakes.<br><br>Melissa accepted her change and her breakfast and turned on one high-heeled shoe, consulting her watch in the same motion. Her meeting with Judge J. P. Carpenter was due to start in just fifteen minutes, which meant she'd have to gobble down the sandwich instead of savoring it at her desk while she listened to her voice mail, as she usually did on Fridays.<br><br>Even without looking, she knew the stranger was watching her leave the cafe; she could feel his gaze like a heartbeat between her shoulder blades, feel it right through her lightweight green corduroy blazer and the white cotton blouse and lacy bra beneath.<br><br>Outside, Alice McCoy, the oldest meter maid in America, by Melissa's reckoning, had pulled up beside the roadster in her special vehicle, a rig resembling a three-wheeled golf cart. A yellow light whirled slowly on the roof as, ticket book in hand, mouth pursed with disapproval, Alice scribbled away.<br><br>"Not another traffic citation, Alice," Melissa protested. "I was only gone for two seconds&#x2014;just long enough to pick up my breakfast!" She held up her sandwich bag as evidence. <em>"Two seconds," </em>she repeated.<br><br>Alice bristled. "This is a no parking zone," she pointed out firmly. "Two seconds or two hours, it makes no never-mind to me. A violation is a violation." She made a little huffing sound and tore off the ticket, leaning to snap it in under one of the windshield wipers, even though Melissa was standing close enough to reach out and take the bit of paper directly from the woman's hand. "You're the county prosecutor," Alice finished, still affronted. "You should know better." She shook her head. "Leaving your car running like that, too. One of these days, it's bound to get stolen and <em>then </em>you'll be piping a different tune, young lady."<br><br>Melissa sighed, retrieved the ticket from her windshield, and stuffed it unceremoniously into the pocket of her blazer. "This is Stone Creek, Arizona," she said, knowing this was an argument she couldn't possibly win but unable to avoid trying. She was, after all, a lawyer&#x2014; and a card-carrying O'Ballivan. "Not the inner city."<br><br>"Crime is everywhere," Alice remarked, with a sniff. "If you ask me, the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket. I shouldn't have to tell <em>you </em>that, of all people."<br><br>Melissa gave up, climbed into the sports car and set her bagged breakfast on the other seat, on top of her briefcase. She drove to the single-story courthouse, a brick building that also served as the local DMV, town jail and sheriff's office, parked in her customary spot in the shade of a venerable old oak tree and hurried inside, juggling her purse, the briefcase, and her rapidly cooling sandwich.<br><br>Melissa's official headquarters, barely larger than her assistant Andrea's cubicle, opened off the same corridor as the single courtroom and the two small cells reserved for the rare prisoner.<br><br>Andrea, at nineteen, wore too much eye makeup and constantly chewed gum, but she could take messages and field phone calls well enough. Because those things comprised her entire job description, Melissa kept her opinions to herself.<br><br></p><h2>The Edge: The Guide to Fulfilling Dreams, Maximizing Success and Enjoying a Lifetime of Achievement</h2><p>The Edge: The Guide to Fulfilling Dreams, Maximizing Success and Enjoying a Lifetime of Achievement...........................................................&#34;The whole idea is to somehow get an edge .

Exhausted from your armchair travels to Paris? Despairing of ever finding a place that speaks to you beyond reason? You are ripe for a journey to Brittany, where author Mark Greenside reluctantly travels, eats of the cr�pes, and finds a second life. <br> <br> When Mark Greenside -- a native New Yorker living in California, doubting (not-as-trusting-as Thomas, downwardly mobile, political lefty, writer, and lifelong skeptic -- is dragged by his girlfriend to a tiny Celtic village in Brittany at the westernmost edge of France, in Finist�re, "the end of the world," his life begins to change. <br> <br> In a playful, headlong style, and with enormous affection for the Bretons, Greenside tells how he makes a life for himself in a country where he doesn't speak the language or know how things are done. Against his personal inclinations and better judgments, he places his trust in the villagers he encounters -- neighbors, workers, acquaintances -- and is consistently won over and surprised as he manages and survives day-to-day trials: from opening a bank account and buying a house to removing a beehive from the chimney -- in other words, learning the cultural ropes, living with neighbors, and making new friends. <br> <br> <i>I'll Never Be French (no matter what I do)</i> is a beginning and a homecoming for Greenside, as his father's family emigrated from France. It is a memoir about fitting in, not standing out; being part of something larger, not being separate from it; following, not leading. It explores the joys and adventures of living a double life.</p><p><b>Mark Greenside</b> holds B.S. and M.A. degrees from the University of Wisconsin. He has been a civil rights activist, Vietnam War protestor, anti-draft counselor, Vista Volunteer, union leader, and college professor. His stories have appeared in <i>The Sun</i>, <i>The Literary Review</i>, <i>Cimarron Review</i>, <i>The Nebraska Review</i>, <i>Beloit Fiction Journal</i>, <i>The New Laurel Review</i>, <i>Crosscurrents</i>, <i>Five Fingers Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Long Story</i>, as well as other journals and magazines, and he&nbsp;is the author of the short story collection, <i>I Saw a Man Hit His Wife</i>.<br><br>He presently lives in Alameda, California, where he continues to teach and be politically active, and Brittany, France, where he still can&#x2019;t do anything without asking for help.<p><b>Getting There</b></p><p>It begins with a girl. It always begins with a girl, and even though we don't make it through the summer -- through even <i>half</i> the summer -- she gets me there and changes my life. It doesn't matter what happened or why, it's one of the best gifts I've ever been given.</p><p>It happened like this.</p><p>It's 1991 and I'm in her apartment, living her third of our bicoastal relationship (one-third in New York, one-third in California, one-third apart), probably the only person in Manhattan looking forward to a summer in the city, when she says, "Honey, let's go to France."</p><p>I close my book and listen, petrified. I hate to fly and don't speak French. This isn't a good idea. I was in Paris in 1966, and they loathed me, and I don't think I've changed that much. "Let's go to Saskatchewan."</p><p>"It's not the same."</p><p>"I know. They speak English and we can drive."</p><p>"Don't worry. I'll take care of everything."</p><p>It's late May, a beautiful spring in New York, and this is her busiest time at work. As far as I can see, there's no need to start studying French.</p><p>That's my second mistake.</p><p>One week later, she announces she's found the perfect place. "It's special, magical, enchanted." She's a poet. Everything she says is exaggerated.</p><p>"Where?" I ask, thinking Paris, Nice, Cannes, Antibes.</p><p>"Brittany. It's as far west as you can go. Finist�re."</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>"The end of the world."</p><p><i>That's</i> when I panic. I go to the bookstore and read in a guidebook that Bretons aren't French but Celtic -- linked by language and culture to the Irish, Scots, Cornish, and Welsh -- so maybe I do have a chance. On the other hand, they've been French since 1532, why chance it? I go to the Caf� des Artistes and write her a note. "Great work. Could you ask if the place is on-a-country-road quiet, sunny, and large? Does it have a good bed, hard mattress, running water, hot running water [remembering my stay in Paris], a TV, stereo, car, separate studies for writing, a coffeemaker, shower, bath, at least two floors, farm animals in the vicinity, a washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher, a bar in the village, a boulangerie, a market, a post office, bikes, and neighbors who want Americans living next door?" I leave it on her desk, thinking, Saskatchewan, here we come.</p><p>The next day she leaves me a message on her answering machine. "We have it -- a thousand a month, with a car."</p><p>I wait a minute, put on my happy voice, and call her at work. "Hi...got your message."</p><p>"Ouiiiiiii," she sings.</p><p>"Does it have all those things I asked about?</p><p>"Certainement. The last thing I need is to listen to you complaining every day."</p><p>"It <i>really</i> has all those things?"</p><p>"That's what the lady said. Her name's Sally. She's English and just returned from the house. She lives in Massachusetts, you can ask her yourself."</p><p>So I do. I call her, and she says yes to everything. There's no way out. I'm going to France.<br></p><p>We book our flight on Air France. All I can think of is a joke I recently heard. "In Heaven, the French are the cooks, Italians are the lovers, English are the police, Swiss are the managers, and Germans are the engineers. In Hell, the English are the cooks, Swiss are the lovers, Italians are the engineers, Germans are the police, and the French are the managers." I know I'm going to die -- but if I do, I'm going in comfort and style. The food on the flight is scrumptious, and we're flying economy. The meal begins with a printed menu and a choice ofboeuf Bourguignon or filet de sole bonne femme. The wine is French -- C�te du Rh�ne, Burgundy, Beaujolais -- and is good and free and limitless. The front of the menu has a lovely little poem by La Fontaine. Mine is "Lion." Hers is "Swan." I look around and see four other poems. Everything about this is class. <i>Joie de vivre, savoir-faire, je ne sais quoi</i>. The movies, the nibbles and snacks, the pampering. If this is France, this is going to be all right, I think -- until we get to the baggage claim, which brings me back to the joke.</p><p>The flight was wonderful, the landing superb. We took off and landed on time. The stewards and stewardesses were everything you'd want them to be in appearance, demeanor, humor, efficiency. I've slept. I'm full. I'm in Paris. I have everything I need -- except my luggage. The good news is, nobody else has theirs either. The worst news is, an hour and a half later, it's still the same. Six and a half hours of relaxing comfort and pleasure getting here, and an hour and a half of standing up, nowhere to go, sit, eat, rest, drink, or relax.</p><p>It's baffling. Everything about Charles de Gaulle Airport is space-age, high-tech modern: tubes, lights, tunnels; escalators running up, down, sideways. The French love gadgets and gadgetry (think guillotine), and everything that can be is automated, everything except labor.</p><p>Two and a half hours later -- 9:30 on the dot -- we're on the bus to Paris. We sit in the seat directly behind the driver. Kathryn takes the window and spends the next hour oohing and aaahing over the architecture and skyline. I spend it in awe of the driver, watching him alternately race to 130 kilometers per hour, then slow down to 30, only to race back to 130 and never once move more than eighteen inches away from the vehicle directly in front of us. He does this for fifty minutes, all the way from Charles de Gaulle A�roport to downtown Paris, where he stops in front of a brasserie.</p><p>"Let's go," Kathryn says.</p><p>"Go where?"</p><p>"To the station."</p><p>For some reason -- and I'm sure there is one, because there always is one, a reason, or rule, or <i>normalement</i> -- the bus stop is across the street from the train station. Across two big busy streets in a city and a country not known for its kind, safe, considerate, California, pedestrian-has-the-right-of-way drivers. A phalanx of cars and trucks whizzes by and shakes the bus.</p><p>"Let's wait," I say.</p><p>"For what? This is the stop. Let's go." She pulls my hand. </p><p>I hesitate, then leap and run to the doorway of the brasserie to wait.</p><p>When everybody is off the bus and milling about, the driver pushes himself out of his seat, lumbers to the side of the bus, raises the panels, and lugubriously begins unloading the luggage. He does it with the seriousness and concentration of a brain surgeon. It's then that I notice his uniform bears no name. No "Hi, I'm Jacques, I'm your driver for the day." No "My name's Pierre. If I drive like a maniac or smash your bag, here's how you can report me." This bothers me, because in a second or two, whatever his name, he's going to hate us.</p><p>Everyone else's bags are relatively small and lightweight, but we're writers and staying for the summer. Between us we have nine heavy bags and two luggage carts. I have a computer. She has a typewriter. We each have a bag filled with books and another with files and notebooks and paper. She has lots and lots of shoes and clothes, something for any occasion. I have three bottles of twelve-year-old Macallan and a jacket and shoes for every kind of weather from blizzards and hurricanes to drought. The driver doesn't know any of this because someone else loaded the bags at the airport. Now, as he pulls them out, he begins to grumble. The fourth bag he yanks and drops on the sidewalk. The fifth he tosses at me. The sixth he throws. The seventh is Kathryn's typewriter. She taps him on the arm and tells him in flawless French that she's a poet and that's her typewriter and asks him to please be careful. He lifts it and puts it down gently, as gently as if it were a quail's egg, the last quail's egg in the world and he's the hungriest man alive. Then he starts talking to her about poetry, quoting Verlaine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and Poe, while I crawl into the luggage bin and tear my pants as I get my computer. When he finally finishes cooing and leaves, she's beaming. "La belle France, la belle France. <i>That's</i> why I love it here."</p><p>That's also when it starts to rain.</p><p>She unzips her backpack and removes an umbrella. I'm amazed and delighted by her forethought. My rain gear is all packed on the bottom of the one bag I have that isn't waterproof. I wait in grateful anticipation as she unsheathes her umbrella and opens it. It's Barbie's umbrella. Thumbelina's. The tiniest little umbrella in the universe. An umbrella for one. I wipe the water from my glasses and glare at her.</p><p>She shrugs.</p><p>I gather our bags as quickly as I can, balance and tie them to our luggage carts, and wait for a lull in the traffic. There is none. You'd think with the rain coming down harder and us standing there getting wet, someone might slow down. Not a chance. The morning Paris commute is a crazed Le Mans. I'm astonished. Can these be the same people who took two and a half hours to unload our bags?</p><p>Kathryn takes two steps into the street. I watch, as miraculously one car stops, then another, and another, and another. It's like royalty entering a room. The stillness is almost palpable. I follow in her wake through the traffic, across the streets, all the way into Gare Montparnasse, feeling unbeatable, like Napoleon must have felt just before Waterloo.</p><p>Gare Montparnasse is huge, gargantuan, signifying grandeur, power, control, direction, order, authority, a plan. The first floor, the one we're standing on, is a big wide-open space. In the middle of this space, slowly, inexorably, moving up and down, is a bank of escalators. On either side of the escalators are stairs.</p><p>I push my luggage cart around in ever-widening circles, looking for the elevator.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"Looking for the elevator."</p><p>"I don't think there is one. I'll ask."</p><p>How can that be? This is a train station. A huge modern train station, the point of departure for all points west in France. How could old people, disabled people, people in wheelchairs, people carrying five heavy bags of luggage like me, get from this floor to the next without an elevator?</p><p>"Nope. No elevator. We have to take the escalator or the stairs."</p><p>"Ask someone else. A woman this time -- an old one."</p><p>She glares at me, but she does it. She finds t...</p></p><h2>How The Reformation Happened</h2><p>At last, this is an accurate explanation of how Christendom suffered &#34;shipwreck&#34; in the Protestant Reformation.

Will it occur before, in the middle of, or after the tribulation? Drs. Feinberg (pretribulation), Archer (midtribulation), and Moo (post-tribulation) present the cases for their respective positions. They also critique each other&#x2019;s positions, and they provide a defense in response to the critiques of their fellow authors. Firmly held and clearly stated convictions are tempered by an irenic spirit. The interactive and fair-minded nature of the Counterpoints format allows the reader to consider the strengths and weaknesses of each view and draw informed, personal conclusions. Three Views on the Rapture is introduced by Richard Reiter&#x2019;s helpful essay tracing the history of this debate in American evangelicalism. The Counterpoints series provides a forum for comparison and critique of different views on issues important to Christians.

When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came through her new village, Sacagawea was offered as a guide since the explorers were heading toward Shoshone territory, where she was from. Pregnant with her first child and the only woman on the expedition, she accompanied them through the frigid winter of 1804-05 and gave birth to her son as the group traveled west. Her knowledge of the land, interpretation skills, and diplomatic manner were of great use to the team and helped ensure a successful voyage. <br><br> This child friendly narrative of Sacagawea's intrepid life contains memorable facts, history, and context, accompanied by elegant illustrations.

He studied painting and illustration at the Paier School of Art and currently does illustration for publishing companies and advertising agencies. He lives in New York City.Grade 2-5-In this brief biography, Adler decribes how Sacagawea was kidnapped at the age of 10 or 11 by an enemy tribe, was sold as a second wife to a rough white trader and trapper who served as an interpreter on the Lewis and Clark expedition to the Pacific, and assisted the expedition through her quick thinking and ability to communicate with other tribes. Unfortunately, none of the horror of her situation-being captured, her family murdered, her forced marriage-comes through in the straightforward text. Brown's illustrations are often at odds with the historical setting. The art is pure Hollywood, particularly the reunion between Sacajawea and her brother, with the young woman fully made up with lipstick and eye makeup. Faces are static, figures are awkwardly posed, and action scenes lack movement. Young readers may be interested in learning about the remarkable woman who graces the new dollar coin, but this story doesn't do her justice.<br><i>Shawn Brommer, Southern Tier Library System, Painted Post, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</h2><p><b>Now in paperback: David Graeber&#x2019;s &#x201c;fresh . . . fascinating . . . thought-provoking . . . and exceedingly timely&#x201d; (<i>Financial Times</i>) history of debt</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom: he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods&#x2014;that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.<br><br>Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like &#x201c;guilt,&#x201d; &#x201c;sin,&#x201d; and &#x201c;redemption&#x201d;) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong.

By the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air.</p><p>In 1984, Ron and Dan Lafferty murdered the wife and infant daughter of their younger brother Allen. The crimes were noteworthy not merely for their brutality but for the brothers' claim that they were acting on direct orders from God. In <i>Under the Banner of Heaven</i>, Jon Krakauer tells the story of the killers and their crime but also explores the shadowy world of Mormon fundamentalism from which the two emerged. The Mormon Church was founded, in part, on the idea that true believers could speak directly with God. But while the mainstream church attempted to be more palatable to the general public by rejecting the controversial tenet of polygamy, fundamentalist splinter groups saw this as apostasy and took to the hills to live what they believed to be a righteous life. When their beliefs are challenged or their patriarchal, cult-like order defied, these still-active groups, according to Krakauer, are capable of fighting back with tremendous violence. While Krakauer's research into the history of the church is admirably extensive, the real power of the book comes from present-day information, notably jailhouse interviews with Dan Lafferty. Far from being the brooding maniac one might expect, Lafferty is chillingly coherent, still insisting that his motive was merely to obey God's command. Krakauer's accounts of the actual murders are graphic and disturbing, but such detail makes the brothers' claim of divine instruction all the more horrifying. In an age where Westerners have trouble comprehending what drives Islamic fundamentalists to kill, Jon Krakauer advises us to look within America's own borders. <i>--John Moe</i>Jon Krakauer?s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this<b> </b>?divinely inspired? crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion,<b> </b>savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America?s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.<br><br>Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and<b> </b>Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ?plural wives,? several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents. <br><br>Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism?s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Fix It!

Meg Langslow is plying her blacksmith's trade at "Caerphilly Days," a festival inspired by her town's sudden notoriety as "The Town That Mortgaged Its Jail." The lender has foreclosed on all Caerphilly's public buildings, and all employees have evacuated &#x2015;except one. Phineas Throckmorton, the town clerk, has been barricaded in the courthouse basement for over a year.</p><p>Mr. Throckmorton's long siege has only been possible because of a pre-Civil War tunnel leading from the courthouse basement to a crawl space beneath the bandstand. The real reason for Caerphilly Days is to conceal the existence of the tunnel: the tourist crowds camouflage supply deliveries, and the ghastly screeching of the tunnel's rusty trap door is drowned out by as many noisy activities as the locals can arrange. But the lender seems increasingly determined to evict Mr. Throckmorton&#x2015;and may succeed after one of its executives is found shot, apparently from inside the basement. Meg and her fellow townspeople suspect that someone hopes to end the siege by framing Mr. Throckmorton. Unless the real killer can be found quickly, the town will have to reveal the secret of the tunnel&#x2015;and the fact that they've been aiding and abetting the basement's inhabitant. Meg soon deduces that the killer isn't just trying to end the siege but to conceal information that would help the town reclaim its buildings--if the townspeople can find it before the lender destroys it in a gut-busting caper that will have giggles and guffaws coming as fast as a four-alarm fire.</p><p>A gaggle of praise for Donna Andrews and the Meg Langslow Mystery Series:</p><p>"If you long for more fun mysteries, a la Janet Evanovich, you'll love Donna Andrews's Meg Langslow series." &#x2015;Charlotte Observer</p><p>"A long-running series that gets better all the time.

Voices roll across the desert sands to Hoshmakaka, a curmudgeonly old camel, whispering that he has been chosen for the great responsibility of carrying gifts to the new baby king. With reluctance, Hoshmakaka accepts his task. Every day in the heat crossing the desert, his pack grows ever more burdensome as the crowds of people, anxious to welcome the new king, give him their gifts to carry. He is as strong as ten horses as he proudly tells the younger camels. But, oh, his gout! Oh, his sciatica! Nevertheless, Hoshmakaka plods on until he reaches Bethlehem. In the end he realizes the great honor of his task and never again is there a burden too heavy for him to carry.<br><br>Vlasta van Kampen's gorgeous illustrations of the hot desert sands and the cool, star-filled night sky transport readers on the journey to Bethlehem to see the new baby king. The beautifully detailed illustrations of the loveable Hoshmakaka masterfully change as his pack of gifts grows impossibly huge.<br><br>The endearing Hoshmakaka is also available as a plush toy to be a companion at storytime.

He was originally commissioned to write the story for THE LAST STRAW by the Toronto Children's Chorus, which performed the piece with musical accompaniment and subsequently recorded it for the CBC. Mr. Thury's works for children's theater include One Potato Too, The Technicolour Wizard, and Behind the Wrinkles.<br><br>Mr. Thury lived in Toronto. He passed away in 2006.A grumpy camel's boast comes back to haunt him in this engaging Christmas picture-book tale, adapted from a choral libretto. Despite gout, sciatica, and general surliness, old Hoshmakaka reluctantly agrees to carry the Wise Men's gifts to the baby king. But because he incautiously puffs himself up before the younger camels, he also ends up taking jugs of milk and wine, baskets of pastries, and other presents offered along the way. Vlasa van Kampen's bright, sharply detailed watercolors depict the shaggy protagonist plodding along in stately arrogance beneath a burden that grows to comically towering proportions. When a child asks him to carry a piece of straw, Hoshmakaka refuses. He relents, however, but he realizes that if he wants to finish his trek, he'd better not stop again. Entering the stable at last, the camel falls to his knees in exhaustion, whereupon a touch of the baby's hand dispels both the burden's weight and the camel's wounded pride. The text and illustrations work unusually well together to evoke the story's humorous undertone while preserving a grand sense of occasion. <i>John Peters</i></p><h2>Edge Chronicles 9: Clash of the Sky Galleons (The Edge Chronicles)</h2><p>In the penultimate book in the <b>Edge Chronicles</b> series, Quint is travelling with his father, Wind Jackal, on a mission to track down and bring to justice Turbot Smeal, the man who started the fire that killed their family.

Steg Jambles, the harpooneer, with young Tem Barkwater, as ever, by his side. Sagbutt, the fierce flat-head goblin, his neck-rings gleaming. And Maris Pallitax, staring up from the fore-deck. They all shared the same expression - one of barely contained panic as they stared wide-eyed at their captain, looking to him for reassurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Only the newest member of the crew seemed immune to the terror of this fearful place he had brought them to. The Stone Pilot. Concealed inside the tall conical hood that she never removed, and silent as the day - only weeks earlier - when she had been rescued from the Deepwoods slave market, she tended the flight-rock, seemingly oblivious to all around her. The sight of the Stone Pilot applying the cooling rods and adjusting the blazing sumpwood burners which surrounded the flight-rock seemed to calm thecaptain, for he took the wheel from his son with a grim smile.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Forgive me, Quint,' he said, running his hands over the flight-levers. 'It's just that, after all these years, he seems so close . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A blast of wind hit the Galerider, making the sky ship shudder from stem to stern, and forcing Wind Jackal to feverishly adjust the hull-weights. His hands raced expertly over the bone-handled flight-levers on either side of the great wheel, raising this one a tad, lowering that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Sky curse this infernal wind!' he snarled, scanning the mud-clogged cliff edge. 'I can't hold her much longer. We must find somewhere to tether . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Suddenly, the strident voice of Spillins cried out from the caternest. 'Jutting rock at fifty strides!'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Thank Sky,' Wind Jackal murmured, removing his right hand from the hull-weight levers for a split second; just long enough to put the carved tilderhorn amulet gratefully to his lips. 'Hold her steady as you can, Stone Pilot. We're depending on you. Tem! Ratbit!' he bellowed. 'Man the winch! Steg, prepare to descend.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A chorus of voices and a flurry of movement erupted all round the sky ship as the crew hurried to do their captain's bidding, taking up their positions and getting to grips with the ship's heavy equipment. Ratbit barked commands at the young and lanky Tem Barkwater as the pair of them swung the winding-winch round until the great ironwood wheel was jutting out over the port side of the sky ship. Steg Jambles secured a leather harness round his midriff, seized the rope that dangled from the winch-wheel andattached one to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Jutting rock directly beneath us!' Spillins shouted down.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint and Maris scurried across the deck - skirting round Filbus Queep the thin-faced quartermaster, who had appeared from his quarters above the aft-hold - and peered over the side. Sure enough, there was the single jutting crag that Spillins had spotted, a small island of stillness and stability amidst the constantly shifting Mire. It stood proud of the oozing white mud, which swirled slowly round it, then poured over the edge in great globules that glistened for a moment, before disappearing into the eternal gloom below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint turned and looked up at the flight-rock platform. The Stone Pilot was standing to the left of the great rock, her back towards him. Since the moment they'd first met, the mysterious figure had uttered not a single word. Yet the hunched urgency with which she worked now, feverishly pumping the rock-bellows and riddling the ashes from the roaring furnace, spoke louder than any words.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Every moment the Galerider hovered here, untethered over the void, it risked being swept away and lost for ever in Open Sky. But the Stone Pilot was a natural, whose skills seemed to grow with every passing day. Under her care now, the heated flight-rockwas gradually becoming less buoyant and the Galerider was descending towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Now, Steg! Now!' bellowed the captain, his hands leaping from lever to bone-handled lever as he fought to keep the sky ship hovering motionless in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Steg Jambles didn't need telling twice. He tested the rope with a quick tug - just to be on the safe side - before stepping off the side of the ship. Tem and Ratbit took the strain and, when Steg had gathered himself, began turning the pulley-lever. Slowly, carefully, they lowered the thick-set fore-decker down through the air towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At the balustrade, Maris gripped Quint's arm and turned to look up at him, her dark eyes glistening with a mixture of awe and excitement. Ever since Wind Jackal had plucked the pair of them away from Sanctaphrax those few short weeks earlier, she had seen so much: the snow-white desolation of the Mire, the treacherous glow of the Twilight Woods, the endless canopy of the Deepwoods from above - as well as the horrors of the slave market from which both the Stone Pilot and Tem Barkwater had been rescued. But this. . . this was the most chilling place they had visited so far, and she shivered with dread.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'The great void,' she murmured tremulously. 'The realm of ghosts and demons and . . . what was it your father said?'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Half-formed things,' said Quint, staring down at the fore-decker dangling below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Stop!' Steg's bellowed command was just audible above the turbulent air.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Tem and Ratbit stopped turning the winch at once, and slid the locking bolt across. Far below, Steg gripped hold of a rough chunk of the jutting rock with one white-knuckled hand, while with the other, he unhooked the glinting rock-spike from his sky pirate coat.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'When you're ready, Master Steg!' Wind Jackal called out from the helm, battling to hold the ship steady, as the howling wind battered and buffeted it, seemingly from all sides at once. &nbsp; Steg thrust the pointed end of the spur into a narrow crack in the rock then, with a great round-bowled hammer that he'd unhooked from his belt, he pounded the spike into place with a flurry of colossal blows. As the sound of Steg's hammer blows rose up from below, Wind Jackal smiled grimly.</p><h2>Soldier of Arete</h2><p><p>The second volume of Gene Wolfe's powerful story of Latro, a Roman mercenary who, while fighting in Greece, received a head injury that deprived him of his short-term memory. In return it gave him the ability to converse with supernatural creatures, gods and goddesses who invisibly inhabit the ancient landscape.</p></p><p>Wolfe's forgetful protagonist Latro continues the odyssey through classical Greece begun in Soldier of the Mist . Serving in King Xerxes's army during the Persian attempt to conquer Greece, in the fifth century B.C., Latro received an injury that makes him forget each day's events. In compensation, he records his experiences on a scroll, the ostensible text of this book. Now a Greek slave in the service of the shipmaster Hypereides, he travels from Sestos, after its fall, to Thrace, where he fights alongside Amazons, and onto the cities of Thought (Athens) and Rope (Sparta). Accompanied by the child Io, who calls herself his slave, and by a fellow captive soldier, Latro seeks to regain his friends, his memory and his freedom. One effect of his curse, or illness, is that he can see and speak with gods, mythical creatures and the dead. The shifting perspective provided by Latro's need to relearn his life and his world every day, with incidents and people portrayed in varying terms each time he writes about them, makes for a many-layered and complex narrative. It is virtually mandatory to read the first volume, although a synopsis here might have precluded the necessity. This is a rich book and a rewarding one for the persevering reader. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Simultaneously cursed with the inability to remember his past and blessed with the ability to speak with gods, a soldier formerly in service to the Great King of Parsa (Persia) seeks answers to his many questions amid the fractured, war-torn landscape of the ancient world. Latro's second-hand view of reality lends a dreamlike quality to a story that mirrors the struggle of human consciousness to explain events beyond its comprehension. In this sequel to Soldier of the Mist, Wolfe achieves a rare blend of history and myth, forming a single shimmering vision of a world unmarked by modern preconceptions.

A mother at fourteen, she had four children by the time she was eighteen and taught herself to play the guitar. She became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1963, and the following year, her first album went Number 1. She was duet partners with Ernest Tubb and the late Conway Twitty, and recorded songs both beloved and controversial (like "The Pill" and "Rated X") as a solo artist. Her first book,<em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em>, hit the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and became an Oscar-winning film. She continues to perform and to command a devoted audience. Loretta Lynn lives in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.<br><br><strong>Patsi Bale Cox</strong> collaborated on the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling<em>Nickel Dreams</em>, the autobiography of Tanya Tucker, and on <em>The View from Nashville</em> and<em>Fifty Years Down a Country Road</em> with Ralph Emery. She is a member of the Grammy nominating committee in the liner note category and lives in Nashville, Tennessee.When asked to write her first memoir, Lynn was in her early 30s: "I hadn't never done nothing with my life except sing and have babies, and I didn't think I had a life to talk about." But Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of the dirt-poor Kentucky girl who married at 14, had four of her six children before she was 21 and went on to become one of country music's most successful recording artists, captured the American imagination. In this follow-up, Lynn mostly focuses on her marriage and the trials and pleasures of Nashville stardom, including fond recollections of friends like Conway Twitty and Tammy Wynnette. Lynn admits that the passing of her husband, Doo drunk, abusive, womanizing and yet her most loyal, trusted companion in 1996, freed her to write more openly. There are no stunning revelations here, rather a series of small, genuine ones about family and career. Though her grammar may make purists flinch ("I thought me and Doo was no longer husband and wife just because he throwed me out"), Lynn's literary voice is as natural and endearing as her songs. Many tales have a conspiratorial tone, and Lynn is quite willing to incriminate herself ("I ain't proud of that story or this next one, but this one has such a good ending I got to tell it anyway"). Honest and always entertaining, Lynn's memoir should delight country music fans and perhaps win her some new ones. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lie Down with Lions</h2><p><b>"Vintage Follett . . .

American Assassin </i>was released as a major film in 2017.The Third Option 1<p></p> <br>Through the darkness the man moved from tree to tree, working his way toward the large house. The nineteenth-century estate, forty miles south of Hamburg, Germany, spanned one hundred and twelve acres of beautiful rolling forest and farmland and was designed after the Grand Trianon at Versailles in France. It had been commissioned by Heinrich Hagenmiller in 1872 to win further favor with William I of Prussia, the newly crowned German emperor. Portions of it had been sold off over the years as it became too expensive to maintain so much land.<br> <br>The man walking silently through the woods had already studied hundreds of photographs of the property and its owner. Some of the photos were snapped from satellites orbiting the earth thousands of miles up, but most were taken by the surveillance team that had been in place for the last week.<br> <br>The assassin had arrived from America only this afternoon and wanted to see with his own eyes what he was up against. Photographs were a good start, but they were no substitute for being there in person. The collar of his black leather jacket was flipped up around his neck to ward off the bite of the cold fall evening. The temperature had dropped twenty degrees since sunset.<br> <br>For the second time since leaving the cottage, he stopped dead in his tracks and listened. He thought he had heard something behind him. The narrow path he trod was covered with a fresh bed of golden pine needles. It was a cloudy night, and with the thick canopy above, very little light reached the place where he stood. He moved to the path&#x2019;s edge and slowly looked back. Without his night-vision scope, he could see no more than ten feet.<br> <br>Mitch Rapp had been trying not to use the scope. He wanted to make sure he could find his way down the path without it, but something was telling him he wasn&#x2019;t alone. Rapp extracted a 9-mm Glock automatic from his pocket and quietly screwed a suppresser onto the end of it. Then he grabbed a four-inch tubular pocket scope, flipped the operating switch on, and held it up to his right eye. The path before him was instantly illuminated with a strange green light. Rapp scanned the area, checking not only the path but his flanks. The pocket scope penetrated the dark shadows that his eyes could not. He paid particular attention to the base of the trees that bordered the path. He was looking for the telltale shoe of someone who was seeking to conceal himself.<br> <br>After five minutes of patiently waiting, Rapp began to wonder if it wasn&#x2019;t a deer or some other creature that had made the noise. After five more minutes, he reluctantly gave in to the conclusion that he had heard an animal of the four-legged variety rather than two. Rapp put the pocket scope away but decided to keep his gun out. He had not made it to the ripe old age of thirty-two by being careless and sloppy. Like any true professional, he knew when the time was right to take chances and when to cut and run.<br> <br>Rapp continued down the path for another quarter of a mile. He could see the lights of the house up ahead and decided to go the rest of the way through the underbrush. Silently, he maneuvered through the thickets, bending branches out of his way and ducking under others. As he approached the edge of the forest, he heard the snap of a twig under his foot and quickly moved to his left, placing a tree directly between himself and the house. A kennel of hunting dogs, not more than a hundred yards away, erupted in alarm. Rapp silently swore at himself and remained perfectly still. This was why he needed to check things out on his own. Amazingly, no one had told him that there were dogs. The canines grew louder, their barks turning to howls, and then a door opened. A deep voice yelled in German for the beasts to be quiet. The man repeated himself two more times, and finally the dogs settled.<br> <br>Rapp slid an eye out from behind the tree and looked at the kennel. The hunting dogs were wired, pacing back and forth. They would be a problem. Not as bad as trained guard dogs, but their senses were still naturally keen. He stood at the edge of the forest listening and watching, taking everything in. He didn&#x2019;t like what he saw. There was a lot of open space between the forest and the house. There were some gardens that he could weave his way through, but it would be hard to stay silent on the paths of crushed rock. The dogs would make approaching from the south very difficult. Surveillance cameras covered the other avenues, and there was twice the open space to traverse. The only good news was that there were no pressure pads, microwave beams, or motion sensors to deal with.<br> <br>Officially, Mitch Rapp had nothing to do with the U.S. government. Unofficially, he had been working for the CIA since graduating from Syracuse University more than a decade ago. Rapp had been selected to join a highly secretive counterterrorism group known as the Orion Team. The CIA had honed Rapp&#x2019;s raw athleticism and intelligence into a lethal efficiency. The few people he allowed to get close to him knew him as a successful entrepreneur who had started a small computer consulting business that required frequent travel. To keep things legitimate, Rapp often did conduct business while abroad, but not on this trip. He had been sent to kill a man. A man who had already been warned twice.<br> <br>Rapp studied the area for almost thirty minutes. When he had seen enough, he started back, but not down the path. If someone was in the woods, there was no sense in walking right into a trap. Rapp quietly picked his way through the underbrush for several hundred yards to the south. He stopped three times and checked his compass to make sure he was headed in the right direction. From the intelligence summary, he knew there was another footpath due south of the one he had come in on. Both paths entered the estate from a narrow dirt road and ran roughly parallel to each other.<br> <br>Rapp almost missed the second footpath. It appeared less frequented than the first one and was overgrown. From there he worked his way back to the curving dirt road. When he reached it, he knelt down and extracted his pocket scope. For several minutes he scanned the road and listened. When he was sure no one else was about, he began walking south.<br> <br>Rapp had been doing this for almost ten years, and he was ready to get out. In fact, this probably would be his last job. He had met the right woman the previous spring, and it was time to settle down. The CIA did not want to let him go, but that was tough. He had already given enough. Ten years of doing what he did for a living was a lifetime. He was lucky to be getting out in one piece and with a marginally sound mind.<br> <br>A little more than a mile down the road, Rapp came upon a small cottage. The shades were drawn, and smoke drifted from the chimney. He approached the door, knocked twice, paused for a second, and then knocked three more times. It opened two inches, and an eye appeared. When the man saw that it was Rapp, he opened the door all the way. Mitch stepped into the sparsely furnished room and began to unbutton his leather jacket. The man who had let him in locked the door behind him.<br> <br>The cottage had knotty pine walls that had been painted white and three-inch plank floorboards that were covered with shiny green paint. Brightly colored oval throw rugs were scattered about the floor, and the furniture was old and solid. The walls were adorned with local folk art and some old black-and-white photographs. Under normal circumstances it would be a great place to spend a cozy fall weekend reading a good book by the fire and taking long walks through the forest.<br> <br>At the kitchen table a woman sat wearing headphones. On the table in front of her was about a quarter of a million dollars in high-tech surveillance equipment. All of the gear was contained in two beat-up black Samsonite suitcases. If anyone were to stop by the cottage, the cases could be closed and moved off the table in seconds.<br> <br>Rapp had never met the man and woman before. He knew them only as Tom and Jane Hoffman. They were in their mid-forties, and as far as Rapp could tell, they were married. The Hoffmans had stopped in two countries before arriving in Frankfurt. Their tickets had been purchased under assumed names with matching credit cards and passports provided by their contact. They were also given their standard fee of ten thousand dollars for a week&#x2019;s work, paid up-front in cash. They were told someone would be joining them and, as always, not to ask any questions.<br> <br>All of their equipment was waiting for them when they arrived at the cottage, and they started right in on the surveillance of the estate and its owner. Several days after arriving at the cottage, they were paid a visit by a man known to them only as the professor. They were given an additional twenty-five thousand dollars and were told they would receive another twenty-five thousand dollars when they completed the mission. He had given them a quick briefing on the man who would be joining them. He did not tell them the man&#x2019;s real name, only that he was extremely competent.<br> <br>Tom Hoffman poured Rapp a cup of coffee and brought it to him by the roaring fieldstone fireplace. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;d ya think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp shrugged his shoulders and looked at Hoffman&#x2019;s face. His complexion was neutral, not flushed like Rapp&#x2019;s from being out in the cold night air. In response to the question, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to be easy.&#x201d; Rapp had already checked the woman&#x2019;s face and shoes. Neither of these people had been outside. It must have been a deer that he had heard in the woods.<br> <br>&#x201c;It rarely is,&#x201d; noted the stocky Hoffman, who took a drink from his own mug once again while trying to get a read on the stranger before him. The six-foot-one muscular man whom he knew only as Carl moved like a big cat&#x2014;soft on his feet. There was nothing clumsy about him. His face was tanned and lined from long hours spent outdoors. His jet-black hair was thick and just starting to gray around the temples, and there was a thin scar on his cheek that ran from his ear down to his jaw.<br> <br>Rapp looked away from Hoffman and into the fire. He knew he was being sized up. Mitch had already done the same with both of them and would continue to do so up until the moment they parted. He looked back into the fire and focused on the plan. He knew the tendency in these situations was to try to come up with something that was truly ingenious&#x2014;a plan that would bypass all of the security and get him in and out without being noticed. This was not necessarily a bad path to take if you had enough time to prepare, but as of right now they had about twenty-three hours to draw the whole thing up and pull it off. With that in mind, Rapp had already begun thinking of a strategy.<br> <br>Turning away from the fire, he asked the woman, &#x201c;Jane, how many people are invited to this party tomorrow night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About fifty.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp ran a hand through his black hair, grabbed the back of his neck, and squeezed. After staring into the fire for a long moment, he announced, &#x201c;I have an idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>THE FIRST SIGNS of morning were showing in the east. The black sky was turning gray, and patches of fog wafted from ponds as the cool fall air mixed with summer&#x2019;s leftover warmth. The pristine Maryland morning was interrupted by a dull thumping noise in the distance. Two Marines walking patrol on the Jeep road by the west fence instinctively searched for the source of the sound. With M-16s slung over their shoulders, they craned their necks skyward, both knowing what was approaching without having to see it. Within seconds they also knew it wasn&#x2019;t a military bird. The telltale thumping was far too quiet. The white helicopter buzzed in over the trees and headed for the interior of the camp. The Marines followed it for a second and then continued with their patrol, both assuming the civilian bird was delivering one of the president&#x2019;s golf partners.<br> <br>The Bell JetRanger continued on an easterly heading toward the camp&#x2019;s water tower. Just in front of the tower was a clearing with a cement landing pad. The bird slowed and floated smoothly toward the ground, its struts coming to rest right on the mark. The pilot shut the turbine engine down, and the rotors began to lose momentum. A black Suburban was parked on the nearby road, and several men in dark suits and ties stood by watching as the visitor stepped out of the helicopter.<br> <br>Dr. Irene Kennedy grabbed her briefcase and headed for the truck. Her shoulder-length brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she was wearing a crisp blue shirt. Kennedy clutched the lapels of her tan suit against the cool air. When she reached the Suburban, an army officer extended his hand. &#x201c;Welcome to Camp David, Dr. Kennedy.&#x201d;<br> <br>The forty-year-old employee of the Central Intelligence Agency took the officer&#x2019;s hand and said, &#x201c;Thank you, Colonel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kennedy&#x2019;s official role was as director of the CIA&#x2019;s Counterterrorism Center. Unofficially, she headed up the Orion Team, an organization born in secrecy out of a need to go on the offensive against terrorism. In the early eighties the United States was stung hard by a slew of terrorist attacks, most notably the bombing of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. Despite the millions of dollars and assets allocated to fight terrorism, after the attacks, things only got worse. The decade ended with the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians. The Lockerbie disaster moved some of the most powerful individuals in Washington to take drastic measures. They agreed it was time to take the war to the terrorists. The first option of diplomacy wasn&#x2019;t doing the job, and the second option of military force was ill suited to fight an enemy that lived and worked among innocent civilians, so America&#x2019;s leaders were left with only one choice: the third option. Covert action would be taken. Money would be funneled into black operations that would never see the light of day, much less congressional oversight or the scrutiny of the press. A clandestine war would be mounted, and the hunters would become the hunted.<br> <br>The ride took just a few minutes, and no one spoke. When they arrived at Aspen Lodge, Kennedy got out and walked up the porch steps, past two Secret Service agents, and into the president&#x2019;s quarters. The colonel escorted Kennedy down the hall to the president&#x2019;s study and knocked on the open door frame.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. President, Dr. Kennedy is here.&#x201d;<br> <br>President Robert Xavier Hayes sat behind his desk sipping a cup of coffee and reading Friday morning&#x2019;s edition of the Washington Post. A pair of black-rimmed reading spectacles sat perched on the end of his nose, and when Kennedy entered he looked up from the print and over the top of his cheaters. Hayes immediately closed the paper and said, &#x201c;Thank you, Colonel.&#x201d; He then rose from his chair and walked over to a small circular table where he gestured for Kennedy to sit.<br> <br>Hayes was dressed for his morning golf match, wearing a pair of khaki pants, a plain blue golf shirt, and a pullover vest. He set his mug down on the table and poured a second cup for Kennedy.

THE SECRET AGENT</b></p> <p>The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling&#x2014;a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension&#x2014;becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.</p> <p>James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p> <p>He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the salle privee.</p> <p>Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each.</p> <p>Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.</p> <p>The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs.</p> <p>Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves often thousand franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p> <p>'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and then left. She executed three "bancos" of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won y and the roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes its expenses.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur Xavier.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur le President.'</p> <p>Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p> <p>And the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafes for lunch.</p> <p>As for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was not personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal killers in France, or in any other country for the matter of that.</p> <p>As he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino. Bond made up his mind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner.</p> <p>He walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the concierge who gave him his key&#x2014;No 45 on the first floor&#x2014;and took the cable.</p> <p>It was from Jamaica and read:</p> <p>KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX<br> BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE<br> INFERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL<br> CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT<br> TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU<br> REQUIRE REGARDS.<br> </p> <p>DASILVA<br> </p> <p>This meant that ten million francs was on the way to him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London asking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where Clements, the head of Bond's department, had spoken to M, who had smiled wryly and told 'The Broker' to fix it with the Treasury.</p> <p>Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica. So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p> <p>This man on the Gleaner, whose name was Fawcett, had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle fisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small Naval Intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture desk of the Gleaner.</p> <p>In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies&#x2014;Keystone, Wide-World, Universal, INP, and Reuter-Photo&#x2014;he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations 1 requiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in England.</p> <p>Fawcett's present assignment was to relay immediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency', with press-collect facilities to France and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p> <p>He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk.</p> <p>Some of this background to his cable passed through Bond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting independently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't only 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly office building near Regent's Park, being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone in London would probably know and want to know where the money had come from.</p> <p>Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and wrote his reply in capital letters:</p> <p>THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE&#x2014;BOND</p> <p>He handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's hands.</p> <p>He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't expect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p> <p>Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted the hubris of his reply to M via Jamaica. As a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway, M probably wouldn't let him have any more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p> <p>Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing-desk.</p> <p>Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper ball-cock.</p> <p>Doing all this, inspecting these minute burglar alarms, did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. He was a secret agent, an...</p></p><h2>George B.

Dunes to the right, modest commercial sprawl to the left.</p><p>Something was out of place. What?</p><p>Heading home at 5:00 p.m. after his tour had ended, he surveyed the road. The trooper didn'twrite a lot of tickets here, leaving that to the county deputies -- professional courtesy -- but he occasionally lit up somebody in a German or Italian car if he was in a mood, and this was the route he often took home at this time of day, so he knew the highway pretty well.</p><p>There...that was it. Something colorful, a quarter mile ahead, sat by the side of the road at the base of one of the hills of sand that cut off the view of Monterey Bay.</p><p>What could it be?</p><p>He hit his light bar -- protocol -- and pulled over onto the right shoulder. He parked with the hood of the Ford pointed leftward toward traffic, so a rear-ender would shove the car away from, not over, him, and climbed out. Stuck in the sand just beyond the shoulder was a cross -- a roadside memorial. It was about eighteen inches high and homemade, cobbled together out of dark, broken-off branches, bound with wire like florists use. Dark red roses lay in a splashy bouquet at the base. A cardboard disk was in the center, the date of the accident written on it in blue ink. There were no names on the front or back.</p><p>Officially these memorials to traffic accident victims were discouraged, since people were occasionally injured, even killed, planting a cross or leaving flowers or stuffed animals.</p><p>Usually the memorials were tasteful and poignant. This one was spooky.</p><p>What was odd, though, was that he couldn't remember any accidents along here. In fact this was one of the safest stretches of Highway 1 in California. The roadway becomes an obstacle course south of Carmel, like that spot of a really sad accident several weeks ago: two girls killed coming back from a graduation party. But here, the highway was three lanes and mostly straight, with occasional lazy bends through the old Fort Ord grounds, now a college, and the shopping districts.</p><p>The trooper thought about removing the cross, but the mourners might return to leave another one and endanger themselves again. Best just to leave it. Out of curiosity he'd check with his sergeant in the morning and find out what had happened. He walked back to his car, tossed his hat on the seat and rubbed his crew cut. He pulled back into traffic, his mind no longer on roadside accidents. He was thinking about what his wife would be making for supper, about taking the kids to the pool afterward.</p><p>And when was his brother coming to town? He looked at the date window on his watch. He frowned. Was that right? A glance at his cell phone confirmed that, yes, today was June 25.</p><p>That was curious. Whoever had left the roadside cross had made a mistake. He remembered that the date crudely written on the cardboard disk was June 26, Tuesday, tomorrow.</p><p>Maybe the poor mourners who'd left the memorial had been so upset they'd jotted the date down wrong.</p><p>Then the images of the eerie cross faded, though they didn'tvanish completely and, as the officer headed down the highway home, he drove a bit more carefully.</p><p>Copyright � 2009 by Jeffrey Deaver</p></p><h2>Evolving in Monkey Town: How a Girl Who Knew All the Answers Learned to Ask the Questions</h2><p>Eighty years after the Scopes Monkey Trial made a spectacle of Christian fundamentalism and brought national attention to her hometown, Rachel Held Evans faced a trial of her own when she began to have doubts about her faith. Growing up in a culture obsessed with apologetics, Evans asks questions she never thought she would ask. She learns that in order for her faith to survive in a postmodern context, it must adapt to change and evolve. Using as an illustration her own spiritual journey from certainty, through doubt, to faith, Evans adds a unique perspective to the ongoing dialogue about postmodernism and the church that has so captivated the Christian community in recent years. In a changing cultural environment where new ideas threaten the safety and security of the faith, Evolving in Monkey Town is a fearlessly honest story of survival.</p><p>"With Evolving in Monkey Town, Rachel Held Evans steps onto the stage as a gifted writer, an honest storyteller, and a compelling voice in the Christian community. She represents what is most hopeful and promising in a new generation of articulate, intelligent, and faithful young leaders. <p> "These days the stories I love to read are the ones that ask questions, that live in the tension, that allow me to bring my doubt and uncertainty and join the conversation. Rachel Held Evans' Evolving in Monkey Town is one of those stories." -- Shauna Niequist, author of <i>Cold Tangerines</i> and <i>Bittersweet</i> </p><p> "This book is an argument--Rachel argues with herself, God, the Bible, and Southern fundamentalism. Somehow, though, we are the winners in this argument because we learn and watch as a young woman emerges into a maturing faith that lets the kingdom vision of Jesus reshape her life. I found myself cheering her on." -- Scot McKnight, Karl A. Olsson Professor in Religious Studies, North Park University </p><p> "Rachel Held Evans is brilliant, gutsy, real, and hilarious, and Evolving in Monkey Town impacted my spiritual journey in ways I never imagined. I can't remember a book that I enjoyed reading more, partly because Rachel is a great writer, and partly because she so fearlessly examines the conflict between her inherited beliefs about God and the truth of her own spiritual experience. There's a certain weight to Evolving in Monkey Town that distinguishes it from the other spiritual memoir books out there." -- Jim Palmer, author of <i>Divine Nobodies</i> and<i> Wide Open Spaces</i> </p><p> "Can I tell you how much I admire Rachel Held Evans? She is smart, compassionate, funny, and relentlessly inquisitive. It is the questions she asks, not the answers she uncovers, that make Evolving in Monkey Town such a compelling read. There are many good books worth reading, but a truly remarkable book will leave you pondering matters long after the cover is closed. I loved this book. That Evans wrote a remarkable debut at such a young age makes me want to slap her, bless her heart." -- Karen Spears Zacharias, author of <i>Will Jesus Buy Me a Double-Wide?: ('Cause I Need More Room for My Plasma TV)</i> </p><p> "It's not every day that a book with the word `monkey' in the title challenges and encourages me like Rachel Held Evans' debut. She adds a fresh, courageous voice to the faith-and-doubt discussion, and it's a voice all of us need to hear." -- Jason Boyett, Author, of <i>O Me of Little Faith: True Confessions of a Spiritual Weakling</i> </p><p> "Evolving in Monkey Town is the kind of book I'll pass along. Rachel Held Evans so accurately highlights her struggles to have a genuine, life-changing, world-beautifying faith. I love her heart, her journey, her questions, and her tentative understanding of Jesus. I'll be thinking about this book and its message for months and years to come. An important read." -- Mary DeMuth, author of <i>Thin Places: A Memoir</i> </p><p> "When we find ourselves asking tough questions, sometimes we want answers, but many times we just want a friend who is asking the same questions we are. Written with refreshing honesty, Rachel Held Evans' new book Evolving in Monkey Town is going to be that friend for many people." -- Chad Gibbs, Author, of <i>God and Football: Faith and Fanaticism in the SEC</i> </p><p> "Rachel's humorous yet humble memoir of growing up in the evangelical world serves as an encouraging guide for anyone looking to navigate through that particular subculture. The story told here is both faith and doubt affirming, a beautiful reflection of a heart earnestly seeking to follow God fully." -- Julie Clawson, author of <i>Everyday Justice: The Global Impact of Our Daily Choices</i> </p><p></p>Evolving in Monkey Town: How a Girl Who Knew All the Answers Learned to Ask the Questions adds a unique perspective to the ongoing dialogue about postmodernism and the Church that has so captivated the Christian community in recent years. In a changing cultural environment where new ideas threaten the safety and security of the faith, award-winning writer Rachel Held Evans tells her fearlessly honest story of survival.Over eighty years after the Scopes Monkey Trial made a mockery of Christian fundamentalism and a spectacle of her hometown of Dayton, Tennessee, Evans explains how evangelicalism survived by successfully adapting to a modern environment. As a result of this adaptation, the conservative Christian community so embraced modern rationalism that Evans grew up in a culture obsessed with apologetics and the Apostle's call to &#x201c;always be ready with an answer&#x201d; in defense of the faith. But when rehearsed answers about religious pluralism, human suffering, biblical interpretation, science, and eternity fail to quiet her own doubts, Evans finds herself in the midst of a faith crisis that forces her to reconsider all she thought she knew about God. Evans concludes that if her faith and the faith of her generation is to survive in a postmodern world, it must once again adapt to its environment and evolve. Evolving in Monkey Town describes the cultural shift from modernism to postmodernism, using as an illustration the author's journey from certainty, through doubt, to faith.By introducing unforgettable characters like June the Ten Commandments Lady, Sam the Feminist, and Nathan the Soldier, Evans puts faces on the theoretical notions of human suffering, pluralism, hell, and hypocrisy in order to challenge her readers to reassess their approach to Christianity in the context of a postmodern environment �&#x20ac;� where knowing all the answers isn't as important as asking the questions.</p><h2>The Spiritual Combat</h2><p>A famous Catholic classic on the strategy for achieving spiritual perfection and salvation.

Doris Kearns Goodwin (No Ordinary Time) argues that FDR's ego was his greatest strength. David McCullough (Truman) concludes that HST was "honest almost to a fault." Stephen Ambrose (D-Day) calls Ike "the president with the most admired and admirable character." Richard Reeves (President Kennedy) admits that JFK "would fail most of the current political tests of character." Robert Dallek (Lone Star Rising) portrays Lyndon Johnson as a contradiction whose grandiosity both served and undermined him. Tom Wicker (One of Us) defines Richard Nixon as a shy, introverted loner struggling with feelings of inadequacy. James Cannon (Time and Chance: Gerald Ford's Appointment with History) emphasizes Ford's integrity. Hendrick Hertzberg (executive editor of the New Yorker) portrays Jimmy Carter more as moral than as political leader. Peggy Noonan, former Reagan speechwriter, contends that Ronald Reagan's emotional detachment was balanced by his "almost Lincolnian" kindness. Finally, Michael Beschloss (The Crisis Years) discusses the role George Bush's father played in developing his son's character. Editor Wilson has his own communication company in Dallas. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.When the issues are too complicated to comprehend or take too much time to sort out, voters can be expected to fall back on the personal qualities of the candidates when they go to the polls. Communications executive and producer Wilson sets out to find the qualities of character of the modern presidents from FDR to George Bush. To do so he brings together some of the most respected historians (Doris Kearns Goodwin, David McCullough, Robert Dallek, and Stephen Ambrose), journalistic heavyweights like James Cannon and Richard Reeves, Reagan speech writer Peggy Noonan, and The New Yorker's Hendrick Hertzberg. While Wilson is seeking the relationship between character and leadership effectiveness, he fails to provide some unifying definition of the word character. It seems most of the articles deal with style and world view rather than ethical matters that "character" might imply. Nevertheless, this should be of interest to both academic and general readers.?Frank Kessler, Missouri Western State Coll., St. Joseph<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mission of Art</h2><p>This is an inspirational book about art's power to bring about personal catharsis and spiritual awakening. Alex Grey's reflections combine his extensive knowledge of art history and his own first-hand experiences in creating art on the boundaries of consciousness. Included are practical techniques and exercises that can be used to explore the spiritual dimension of art. Challenging and thought-provoking, <i>The Mission of Art </i> will be enjoyed by everyone who has ever contemplated the deeper purpose of artistic expression.</p><p>Alex Grey is best known for his depictions of the human body that "x-ray" the multiple layers of reality and reveal the interplay of anatomical and spiritual forces. His paintings have been featured in venues as diverse as the album art of the Beastie Boys, <i>Newsweek </i>magazine, the Discovery Channel, rave flyers and sheets of blotter acid. Grey's artworks have been exhibited and performed throughout the world and are chronicled in the book <i>Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey. </i> He lives in New York City.In this Technicolor manifesto calling for a renewed spiritual content in modern art, Grey argues that contemporary artists have lost touch with the search for transcendence that infused the work of such masters as Michelangelo, van Gogh, Pollock and Kahlo. In a freewheeling narrative, Grey compares what he sees as the materialism and moral irresponsibility of most contemporaryart to his own creative endeavors, which draw on meditation, visualization, shamanic drumming, Taoism, yoga and Tibetan Buddhism. The book is bursting with his own mystical paintings and drawings, depicting floating cosmic eyes, the soul leaving the body of a dying person, haloed skulls, metaphysical thought-diagrams, human torsos lit from within by chakras or psychic energy centers. If this sounds reminiscent of the psychedelic 1960s, that may be because, as Grey freely admits, "sacramental" hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline have been a source of inspiration for him since the mid-1970s. He's found equal inspiration, however, in the works of Blake, Kandinsky and the drawings he made of Michelangelo's sculptures and paintings during a 1994 trip to Italy. Grey acknowledges a big debt to transpersonal psychology, the study of manifold dimensions of human consciousness, a science whose leading philosopher, Wilber, contributes the hyperbolic foreword ("Alex Grey might be the most significant artist alive"). As a hodgepodge of art-historical analysis, social commentary and spiritual philosophizing, the book is so idiosyncratic, and sometimes so preachy, that many readers will find it difficult to penetrate. But Grey's insistence that art should be a revelatory and healing force in our culture should resonate with artists in virtually any discipline. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Out</h2><p>In the Tokyo suburbs four women work the draining graveyard shift at a boxed-lunch factory. Burdened with chores and heavy debts and isolated from husbands and children, they all secretly dream of a way out of their dead-end lives. A young mother among them finally cracks and strangles her philandering, gambling husband then confesses her crime to Masako, the closest of her colleagues. For reasons of her own, Masako agrees to assist her friend and seeks the help of the other co-workers to dismember and dispose of the body. The body parts are discovered, the police start asking questions, but the women have far more dangerous enemies -a yakuza connected loan shark who discovers their secret and has a business proposition, and a ruthless nightclub owner the police are convinced is guilty of the murder. He has lost everything as a result of their crime and he is out for revenge. OUT is a psychologically taut and unflinching foray into the darkest recesses of the human soul, an unsettling reminder that the desperate desire for freedom can make the most ordinary person do the unimaginable. REAL WORLD: New Natsuo Kirino coming out in September 2008</p><p>Nothing in Japanese literature prepares us for the stark, tension-filled, plot-driven realism of Natsuo Kirino's award-winning literary mystery Out." <br>This mesmerizing novel tells the story of a brutal murder in the staid Tokyo suburbs, as a young mother who works the night shift making boxed lunches strangles her abusive husband and then seeks the help of her coworkers to dispose of the body and cover up her crime. The coolly intelligent Masako emerges as the plot's ringleader, but quickly discovers that this killing is merely the beginning, as it leads to a terrifying foray into the violent underbelly of Japanese society. <br>At once a masterpiece of literary suspense and pitch-black comedy of gender warfare, Out is also a moving evocation of the pressures and prejudices that drive women to extreme deeds, and the friendships that bolster them in the aftermath.Natsuo Kirino, born in 1951, quickly established a reputation in Japan as one of a rare breed of crime writer whose work goes well beyond the conventional crime novel. This fact has been demonstrated by her winning not only Japan&#39;s top mystery award, for Out, but one of its major literary awards, the Naoki Prize, for Soft Cheeks, followed by the Tanizaki Prize for Tokyo Island. Several of her books have also been turned into movies.</p><h2>The Rogue Warrior&#39;s Strategy for Success: A Commando&#39;s Principles of Winning</h2><p>The co-author of the New York Times best-selling Rogue Warrior adventure series follows up his highly successful book, Leadership Secrets of the Rogue Warrior, with more battle plans for one&#39;s business and personal life.

Among the points and principles you'll gather as a warrior in business: </p><p><b>Know what drives you.</b> <br> Socrates had it right: know thyself.

And if you're in a position of leadership, it's crucial that you understand the drives, motives, and values of each member of your team. </p><p>Don't get self-satisfied. <br> It's an adage that bears repetition: NEVER let success go to your head -- or it will eventually wind up at the other end of your anatomy. THINK STRATEGICALLY. A sound and aggressive strategic plan will support your tactical attack on any problem, and keep you <i>humbly</i> successful. </p><p><b>Be ready to risk -- again and again and again.</b> <br> A sure cure for complacency is not fearing innovation. Stand ready to go to the war of life -- and business -- repeatedly. Don't wait for life, or your competition, to define your character for you: doing it yourself is the only way! Reinventing your life, and the life of your organization, is one of the best cures and preventive techniques for complacency, boredom, and lack of productivity. </p><p>MArcinko speaks with enormous authority on the subject of success.

Cadell, J.D. Ferguson, G.L. Hunter and S.J. Peploe are now amongst the most admired of early twentieth century British artists. Their direct contact with French Post-Impressionism and early knowledge of the work of Matisse and the Fauves, encouraged them to produce paintings which are considered some of the most progressive in British art of the early twentieth century. During their lifetime the Colourists developed an international reputation, exhibiting in Paris, London and New York as well as Scotland. Since their deaths they have often been overlooked in histories of British art, but in the last twenty years there has been a dramatic revival of interest in their work. Featuring essays describing the artists&#39; lives and their involvement with the avant garde in Paris in the early years of the twentieth century, this book is richly illustrated with over 100 of the Colourists&#39; most stylish and inventive paintings.</p><p></p><h2>Life at Blandings</h2><p>P.G.

He was created a Knight of the British Empire in 1975 and died on St. Valentine&#39;s Day in the same year at the age of ninety-three. His novels are translated into every language and are frequently adapted for radio and television.

All of a sudden, they have the power to grant wishes, travel to extraordinary places (and not necessarily on public transportation), and make people and objects disappear. Luckily (and luck does have something to do with it), the twins are introduced to their eccentric djinn-Uncle Nimrod, who will teach them how to harness their newly found power. And not a moment too soon!</p><p>You can tell from the very first page that P. B. Kerr had great fun writing his novel, <i>The Akhenaten Adventure</i>. The way the author introduces his cleverly named characters, the atmospheric setting, the fun tone of his narration--all indicate that a hugely entertaining story is in store. The first installment of his <i>Children of the Lamp</i> sequence is set firmly in the present day, but it soon breaks away and encompasses several wonderfully colorful parts of the globe, England and Egypt included.<p> </p><p> John and Philippa Gaunt, two twelve-year-old not-very-identical twins, live a privileged life on the Upper East of Manhattan with their wealthy parents and two curiously-mannered Rottweilers named Alan and Neil. The twins realize there's something amiss with their world when a string of strange things begin to happen after their wisdom teeth are extracted--they dream the same dreams, become stronger, their zits clear up, and wishes wished in their presence inexplicably come true. And, when their estranged Uncle Nimrod asks them to come to England for the summer during one such shared dream, the discovery of their destiny is set in motion. </p><p> </p><p> John and Phillippa discover that they are descended from a long line of Djinn, have great inherent powers. They must call on these powers a lot sooner than they anticipated, though, because the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten is not as dead as history has so far declared and his legion of seventy magical djinn could tip the balance of power in the magical realm and affect the whole world order. </p><p> </p><p> P.B.

He previously wrote a column for the <i>New York Times</i> and contributed to numerous gardening magazines. He lives and gardens in Brooklyn, New York.There's good reason for the oak being called mighty, writes certified arborist and former <i>New York Times </i>columnist Logan (<i>Dirt: The Ecstatic Skin of the Earth</i>) in this sprawling biography of a tree. It's ubiquitous, highly adaptable and was once the most essential tree in the Earth's temperate zones. Easily harvested acorns arguably nurtured people long before they learned to sow and hunt. Oak lumber, readily available and remarkably flexible, once made possible the naval and trading ships of seafaring nations; the same wood, shaped by craftsmen using fundamentally the same tools for thousands of years, was used to craft casks that stored water, wine and food on long voyages and through the seasons. Now, the tree that, according to Logan, once shaped civilizations, providing all "the material necessities for human life," is used primarily in the Western world for wooden pallets and low-end flooring. With this multidisciplinary study's recipe for acorn bread, its paean to the currier's leather-making craft and the cooper's barrel-making skill, and its thumbnail forays into religious rites, natural science and the importance of squirrels and jays, this work is an entertaining and instructive homage to the oak. 30 illus. not seen by <i>PW.</i><i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m concerned too much or too little with my appearance; it&#x2019;s that I&#x2019;m concerned with the wrong thing altogether. <em>True Beauty</em> puts in his rightful place the Source of all that is beautiful and good, and begs me to look there instead of my bathroom mirror.

The authors help us see God&#x2019;s pattern for reflecting the beauty of Christ in our hearts first and foremost, but also in the care of our bodies, in our fashion, and in other areas of life where beauty for its own sake tends to be a temptation. May all who read this book come away with greater desire to reflect the beauty of God in all of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thabiti and Kristie Anyabwile</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor, Anacostia River Church, Washington, DC;&nbsp;and his wife</p><p>&#x201c;What a breath of fresh air this book brings to the complicated and far-too-often consuming relationship women have with beauty. Our culture is consumed with pursuing almost unattainable standards of appearance, and all of us have been influenced more than we know. This book reminds us of biblically sound, gospel-oriented truth. The authors help us see areas of self-absorption, and give us practical wisdom on how to grow in being absorbed with God and his glory. They help us examine our hearts and inspire us to grow beyond being women of &#x2018;good looks&#x2019; to being women known for good works.

Soon this large-spirited older man, a divorc� with three little girls, swept her into his orbit, and before she knew it she was embracing his extended family plus a child of their own, and hosting endless parties in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of The Open Arms. <br><br>Now, some thirty years later, after presiding over a disastrous family picnic, Rebecca is caught un-awares by the question of who she really is. How she answers it&#x2014;how she tries to recover her girlhood self, that dignified grownup she had once been&#x2014;is the story told in this beguiling, funny, and deeply moving novel.<br><br>As always with Anne Tyler&#x2019;s novels, once we enter her world it is hard to leave. But in <b>Back When We Were Grownups</b> she so sharpens our perceptions and awakens so many untapped feelings that we come away not only refreshed and delighted, but also infinitely wiser.</p><p>The first sentence of Anne Tyler's 15th novel sounds like something out of a fairy tale: "Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person." Alas, this discovery has less to do with magic than with a late-middle-age crisis, which is visited upon Rebecca Davitch in the opening pages of <i>Back When We Were Grownups</i>. At 53, this perpetually agreeable widow is "wide and soft and dimpled, with two short wings of dry, fair hair flaring almost horizontally from a center part." Given her role as the matriarch of a large family--and the proprietress of a party-and-catering concern, the Open Arms--Rebecca is both personally and professionally inclined toward jollity. But at an engagement bash for one of her multiple stepdaughters, she finds herself questioning everything about her life: "How on earth did I get like this? How? How did I ever become this person who's not really me?"<p> She spends the rest of the novel attempting to answer these questions--and trying to resurrect her older, extinguished self. Should she take up the research she began back in college on Robert E. Lee's motivation for joining the Confederacy? More to the point, should she take up with her college sweetheart, who's now divorced and living within easy striking range? None of these quick fixes pans out exactly as Rebecca imagines. What she emerges with is a kind of radiant resignation, best expressed by 100-year-old Poppy on his birthday: "There <i>is</i> no true life. Your true life is the one you end up with, whatever it may be." A tautology, perhaps, but Tyler's delicate, densely populated novel makes it stick.</p><p> Yes, Poppy. There are also characters named NoNo, Biddy, and Min Foo--the sort of saccharine roll call that might send many a reader scampering in the opposite direction. But Tyler knows exactly how to mingle the sweet with the sour, and in <i>Back When We Were Grownups</i> she manages this balancing act like the old pro she is. Even the familiar backdrop--shabby-genteel Baltimore, which resembles a virtual game preserve of Tylerian eccentrics--seems freshly observed. Can any human being really resist this novel? It is, to quote Rebecca, "a report on what it was like to be alive," and an appealingly accurate one to boot. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><br>&#x201c;You are involved before you even notice you were paying attention . . .

While other historians have focused their examinations on the cataclysmic years immediately before and after 1917, Figes shows how the revolution, while it changed in form and character, nevertheless retained the same idealistic goals throughout, from its origins in the famine crisis of 1891 until its end with the collapse of the communist Soviet regime in 1991.</p><p>Figes traces three generational phases: Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who set the pattern of destruction and renewal until their demise in the terror of the 1930s; the Stalinist generation, promoted from the lower classes, who created the lasting structures of the Soviet regime and consolidated its legitimacy through victory in war; and the generation of 1956, shaped by the revelations of Stalin's crimes and committed to "making the Revolution work" to remedy economic decline and mass disaffection. Until the very end of the Soviet system, its leaders believed they were carrying out the revolution Lenin had begun.</p><p>With the authority and distinctive style that have marked his magisterial histories, Figes delivers an accessible and paradigm-shifting reconsideration of one of the defining events of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Orlando Figes</b> is the author of eight books on Russia that have been translated into twenty-seven languages; they include <i>The Whisperers</i>, <i>A People's Tragedy</i>, <i>Natasha's Dance</i>, and <i>Just Send Me Word</i>. A professor of history at Birkbeck, University of London and a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, Figes is the recipient of the Wolfon History Prize, the W. H. Smith Literary Award, the NCR Book Award, and the<i> Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, among others.<p>Introduction</p> <p>My aim is to provide a brief account of the Russian Revolution in the <i>longue dur�e</i>, to chart one hundred years of history as a single revolutionary cycle. In this telling the Revolution starts in the nineteenth century (and more specifically in 1891, when the public&#x2019;s reaction to the famine crisis set it for the first time on a collision course with the autocracy) and ends with the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.</p> <p>It might seem odd to plot the Revolution in one hundred years of history. Most short books on the subject focus on the years immediately before and after 1917. But to understand the Revolution&#x2019;s origins, its violent character and tragic course from freedom to dictatorship, one must look more closely at the tsarist past; and to perceive its lasting outcomes, one must see it in the broader context of Soviet history. Many of the themes of the first chapters on the tsarist period&#x2014;the absence of a political counter-balance to the power of the state; the isolation of the educated classes from the common people; the rural backwardness and poverty that drove so many peasants to seek a better life in the industrial towns; the coercive basis of authority in Russia; and the extremism of the socialist intelligentsia&#x2014;will reappear in the later chapters on 1917 and the Soviet regime.</p> <p>When did the Russian Revolution end? Historians have chosen various dates, depending on the stories which they wish to tell, and these of course can all be justified. Some have ended their accounts in 1921 with the ending of the Civil War, when armed opposition to the Bolsheviks was finally defeated, and the consolidation of the Soviet dictatorship. Others have concluded with the death of Lenin in 1924, as I did in <i>A People&#x2019;s Tragedy</i>, a work on which I draw in these pages, on the grounds that by this time the basic institutions, if not the practices, of the Stalinist regime were in place. One or two have ended in 1927, with the defeat of Trotsky and the Left Opposition; or in 1929, with the onset of a new revolutionary upheaval, the forced industrialization and collectivization of the first Five Year Plan, implying that the Stalinist economy was the significant outcome of 1917.</p> <p>One of the most influential historians of the Soviet period, Sheila Fitzpatrick, concluded her short history of the Revolution in the mid-1930s, a period of &#x2018;retreat&#x2019; from its utopian objectives when the structural economic changes of Stalin&#x2019;s Revolution were consolidated as a permanent system. By her own later admission, this was to suggest that the Great Terror of 1937&#x2013;8 was a &#x2018;monstrous postscript&#x2019; to the Revolution, an aberration explained by the regime&#x2019;s fear of war, when in fact it was a part of it&#x2014;the biggest in a series of waves of terror whose origins can only be explained by the insecurities of the Soviet regime going back to 1917. To omit the Great Terror from a history of the Russian Revolution, Fitzpatrick acknowledged, would be the equivalent of writing an account of the French Revolution of 1789 without the Reign of Terror (1793&#x2013;4) for which it was chiefly known.1</p> <p>The Great Terror was not the final wave of violence by the Soviet state. The population of the Gulag labour camps, which Solzhenitsyn placed at the very core of the Bolshevik experiment, reached its peak, not in 1938, but in 1952. So it does not make much sense to end a history of the Revolution with the halting of the Great Terror. But then it doesn&#x2019;t make much sense either to break it off in 1939 or 1941. The Second World War did not interrupt the Revolution. It intensified and broadened it. Bolshevism came into its own during the war&#x2014;with its military discipline and cult of sacrifice, its willingness to expend human life to meet its goals, and its capacity to militarize the masses through its planned economy, it was made to fight. The Revolution was reforged and toughened by the war. Through the Red Army and its NKVD units, the Soviet empire tightened its control of its borderlands in West Ukraine and the Baltic, purging towns and villages and sending to the Gulag, in their hundreds of thousands, nationalist insurgents, repatriated Soviet servicemen and &#x2018;collaborators&#x2019; with the Germans. By force of arms, the Bolsheviks exported the Russian Revolution into Eastern Europe&#x2014;first in 1939&#x2013;40 and again in 1945.</p> <p>The Cold War, in this sense, has to be seen as a continuation of the international civil war started by the Bolsheviks in 1917. The global ambitions of the Revolution&#x2019;s leaders remained essentially unchanged, from their first attempts to extend Soviet power into Europe through the invasion of Poland in 1920 to their final foreign adventure in Afghanistan after 1979. Lenin&#x2019;s power seizure had been based on the idea that the Revolution could not survive on its own in a backward peasant country such as Russia, that it needed the support of revolutions in the more advanced industrial states or in countries that could give it the resources it needed to industrialize: a life-or-death conflict between socialism and the capitalist powers was unavoidable as long as capitalism existed. Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev and Andropov, if not Gorbachev, were all Leninists in this belief.</p> <p>Until the end of their regime, the Soviet leaders all believed they were continuing the Revolution Lenin had begun. Their means of rule altered over time, of course, particularly after Stalin&#x2019;s death, when they gave up on the use of mass terror, but they always saw themselves as Lenin&#x2019;s heirs, working to achieve the same utopian goals envisaged by the founders of the Soviet state: a Communist society of material abundance for the proletariat and a new collective type of human being. That is why I think a good case can be made for the Revolution being treated as a single cycle of one hundred years, ending with the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991.</p> <p><br>Within this longer cycle I aim to explain the Revolution&#x2019;s rise and fall in three generational phases. The first corresponds to the lifetime of the Old Bolsheviks, mostly born in the 1870s or 1880s and, if not already dead, eliminated in the Great Terror. Their utopian ideals and austere party culture of military unity and discipline had been shaped by years of struggle in the conspiratorial underground. But they obtained their revolutionary power from the cataclysm of the First World War&#x2014;which seemed at once to undermine the value of a human life and to open up the possibility of altering the nature of humanity out of the destruction it had caused&#x2014;and reached the height of their destructive fury in the Civil War, from which the Bolsheviks emerged victorious and strengthened in their conviction that any fortress could be stormed. From these killing fields they set about the building of a new society. But they could not overcome the problem of the peasantry&#x2014;the smallholding family farmers who made up three quarters of the country&#x2019;s population and dominated its economy&#x2014;with their individualistic attitudes, patriarchal customs and attachment to the old Russian world of the village and the church. To so many of the Party&#x2019;s new supporters&#x2014;peasant sons and daughters who had fled the &#x2018;backward&#x2019; village for a better life&#x2014;the Revolution could not banish peasant Russia fast enough.</p> <p>Here were the roots of Stalin&#x2019;s &#x2018;revolution from above&#x2019;, the second phase of the cycle charted here, beginning with the Five Year Plan of 1928&#x2013;32. Stalinism&#x2019;s vision of modernity gave fresh energy to the utopian hopes of the Bolsheviks. It mobilized a whole new generation of enthusiasts&#x2014;young ambitious workers, officials and technicians born around the turn of the century and schooled in Soviet values&#x2014;who forced through Stalin&#x2019;s policies of crash collectivization and industrialization and who, through the purges of the 1930s, took the places of the old �lites. Collectivization was the real revolution of Soviet history&#x2014;the complete overturning of a peasant way of life that had developed over many centuries&#x2014;and a catastrophe from which the country never recovered. It was a social holocaust&#x2014;a war against the peasants&#x2014;uprooting millions of hardworking families from their homes and dispersing them across the Soviet Union. This nomadic population became the labour force of the Soviet industrial revolution, filling the great cities, the building-sites and labour camps of the Gulag.</p> <p>The industrial infrastructure built by Stalin in the 1930s remained in place until the end of the Soviet system. His Five Year Plans became the model for Communist development throughout the world. They were said to be the cause of the Soviet military victory in 1945&#x2014;the justifying rationale for everything accomplished by the October Revolution according to Soviet propaganda. But these achievements came at an enormous human cost&#x2014;far bigger than we had imagined before the archives opened after 1991&#x2014;so big that they challenge us to think about the moral nature of the Stalinist regime in ways reserved previously for historians of Nazism.</p> <p>Khrushchev&#x2019;s speech denouncing Stalin&#x2019;s crimes marks the start of the Revolution&#x2019;s third and final phase. The Soviet system never recovered from the crisis of belief caused by Khrushchev&#x2019;s revelations at the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956. For the next thirty years the leadership was split about how far they could build on Stalin&#x2019;s legacies, or even recognize his influence, except as a war leader. The country was divided between Stalin&#x2019;s victims and those who revered his memory or took pride in Soviet achievements under Stalin&#x2019;s leadership. But the speech was the defining moment for a younger generation that identified itself by the years of Khrushchev&#x2019;s &#x2018;thaw&#x2019; (the <i>shestidesiatniki</i> or &#x2018;people of the sixties&#x2019;), among them a 1955 law graduate from Moscow University called Mikhail Gorbachev, whose ideas of socialist renewal were first sown by Khrushchev&#x2019;s programme of de-Stalinization.</p> <p>The challenge facing all the later Soviet leaders was to sustain popular belief in the Revolution as it became a remote historical event. The problem was particularly acute for the generation born since 1945: they were too young even to relate to the &#x2018;Great Patriotic War&#x2019;, the other main legitimizing Soviet myth after the &#x2018;Great October Socialist Revolution&#x2019;. Better educated and more sophisticated than the Stalin-era generation, the post-war Soviet baby boomers were less engaged in the Revolution&#x2019;s history or ideas than in Western music, films and clothes. Did this make the demise of the Soviet system unavoidable? Is any revolution destined to run out of energy, to die from old age, if it lives as long as the Soviet Union did? The Chinese endgame (liberalizing the economy within the one-party state) could briefly have been an alternative for the Soviet leadership under Andropov and Gorbachev, although it is doubtful whether economic modernization could have saved the system in the longer term (the Soviet population had forgotten how to work). But in the end it was Gorbachev&#x2019;s commitment to political reform&#x2014;a belief rooted in his Leninist ideals&#x2014;that brought the system down.</p> <p><br>In 2017 the world&#x2019;s media will reflect on the Revolution during its centenary. It is a good time to look back at 1917. A generation after the collapse of the Soviet regime, we can see it more clearly, not as part of Cold War politics or Sovietology, but as history, a series of events with a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p> <p>Retrospective distance enables us to see the Revolution from a fresh perspective and to ask again the big questions: why Russia? why Lenin? why Stalin? why did it fail? and what did it all mean? Questions as worth engaging with at the start of the next hundred years as they were during the last.</p> <p>Seen from today&#x2019;s perspective the Revolution appears very differently from the way it looked in 1991. Communism now seems, more than ever, like something from a stage of history that has been passed. Capitalism may have its crises, but outside North Korea no one sees the Soviet model of the planned economy as a viable alternative, not even China or Cuba any more. Russia has become very much weaker as a power in the world. Its loss of empire and foreign influence has been so dramatic that it makes one wonder how it held the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for so long. Russia is no longer an aggressive state. It does not start foreign wars. Economically it is a pale shadow of the powerhouse it was on the eve of the First World War. Seventy years of Communism ruined it. Yet the authoritarian state tradition has revived in Russia in a manner unexpected twenty years ago. This resurgence, based on Putin&#x2019;s reclamation of the Soviet past, demands that we look again at Bolshevism&#x2014;its antecedents and its legacies&#x2014;in the long arc of history.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2014 by Orlando Figes</p></p><h2>For the Sake of Elena</h2><p>Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, enter the world of Cambridge University to investigate the bludgeoning death of Elena Weaver.

He wrote countless stories and thirty-three plays, in some of which he performed. Several films have been made from his novels, including The Sound of Waves, Enjo which was based on The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Among his other works are the novels Confessions of a Mask and Thirst for Love and the short story collections Death in Midsummer and Acts of Worship. The Sea of Fertility tetralogy, however, is his masterpiece. After Mishima conceived the idea of The Sea of Fertility in 1964, he frequently said he would die when it was completed. On 25 November 1970, the day he completed The Decay of the Angel, the last novel of the cycle, Mishima committed seppuku (ritual suicide) at the age of forty-five.</p><h2>A Box of Rain 1965-1993</h2><p>A collection of more then 250 song lyrics by Robert Hunter includes all his songs written for the Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia, other artists, and those performed by Hunter himself, along with epic song-poems that have only been partially recorded</p><p>Premier lyricist for the Grateful Dead, Hunter has also had his material recorded by the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Jefferson Starship, Bob Dylan, and Grateful Dead guru Jerry Garcia in his solo work.

Reprint.</p><p>Rancorous political infighting surrounds the selection of a successor to the dying head of the CIA just as Mitch Rapp, the agency's top operative, embarks on a dangerous mission to take out a well-known German industrialist believed to be supplying Middle East terrorists with highly sensitive equipment critical to constructing a nuclear bomb. When Rapp's ultimately successful mission is compromised from within, ailing CIA director Thomas Stansfield puts his imprimatur on the efforts of his chosen successor, Irene Kennedy, director of the agency's Counterterrorism Center, to identify the powerful interests both inside and outside the agency that wanted Rapp to fail. <p> The motive soon becomes clear; there are people who'll stop at nothing to remove Kennedy from the helm of the agency after Stansfield dies. One thing they didn't count on was Rapp's survival, and now he's a lethal weapon whose sights are fixed directly on the most powerful among them. This is a strong, swift thriller, a bit predictable (the senator in the black hat has dogs named Caesar and Brutus) but nonetheless involving.

A bent and bereft hag is spotted crouching over the snowy grave of Andrea Parkin, David Parkin's three-year-old daughter who died twenty years prior. When the night watchman approaches the figure and tells her the cemetery is closed, she mysteriously disappears, leaving behind one red rose and a letter. When the child's mother comes to pay respect the following day, she finds the letter and its shocking news. Could David's mother be alive? The search for the answer sends David on a cross-country journey and into the arms of another woman. But the knowledge he gains gives him the strength to make the ultimate sacrifice for his loved ones. The dialogue is at times overly portentous, such as: "'David, what your mother is, or was, has nothing to do with who you are.' David shook his head. 'It has everything to do with who I am. Especially now. My mother's leaving is the reason I cannot forgive myself for losing my daughter.'" And one tires of Evans's three favorite words--"ardent," "gasp," and "cacophony." But fans of his sentimental journeys will want to keep their hankies handy.<p><i>The Letter,</i> the final book of the <i>Christmas Box</i> collection is, most simply stated, the love story of David and MaryAnne Parkin. But it is also everyone's love story, for it is about the storms that all relationships must face when the blissful state of romance vanishes into one of real-life challenges and difficulties. We often forget that it is in the hard times that we truly see what is best in love as well as in life. Though love may be temporarily darkened, true love never gives in, or up, but holds tight to noble ideas, which transcend this earth and all time. </p><p><i>The Letter</i> is also about our pasts and our individual quests to discover who we are. In <i>The Letter,</i> David Parkin sets out on a journey to find his mother, a woman who abandoned him when he was a child. In truth, however, David is searching for himself as he seeks to free himself from the pain of her rejection and his fear that he was somehow unworthy of her love. In a sense, David's search is the same journey we are all pursuing. We are all seeking love. </p><p>My hope is that you will feel what I felt as I wrote this book -- the divine nature of loyalty and the understanding of why we must share love whenever and wherever. </p><p>One final note. I am saddened to finish the <i>Christmas Box</i> trilogy and to bid good-bye to the Parkin family. I do not know if I shall ever visit them again, but I am glad for this last story -- a story which I think is a fitting sendoff for the characters I've grown to love. I hope that the message you find in their lives is meaningful to your own. And, most of all, that in reading the <i>Christmas Box</i> collection, you, and those with whom you share my books, will never be the same. </p><p>With my love, Richard Paul Evans</p></p><h2>Kingdoms of Elfin (A Delta book)</h2><p>changelings, poets, dissidents and gypsies, professors and witches, fairies of high and low degree spring to life in these magical tales</p><p></p><h2>Solve Your Child&#39;s Sleep Problems</h2><p><p> You've tried everything.

Cline uses the tools of his trade to examine some of the most puzzling mysteries from the Hebrew Bible and, in the process, to narrate the history of ancient Israel. Combining the academic rigor that has won the respect of his peers with an accessible style that has made him a favorite with readers and students alike, he lays out each mystery, evaluates all available evidence&#x2014;from established fact to arguable assumption to far-fetched leap of faith&#x2014;and proposes an explanation that reconciles Scripture, science, and history.<br><br>Numerous amateur archaeologists have sought some trace of Noah's Ark to meet only with failure. But, though no serious scholar would undertake such a literal search, many agree that the Flood was no myth but the cultural memory of a real, catastrophic inundation, retold and reshaped over countless generations. Likewise, some experts suggest that Joshua's storied victory at Jericho is the distant echo of an earthquake instead of Israel's sacred trumpets&#x2014;a fascinating, geologically plausible theory that remains unproven despite the best efforts of scientific research.<br><br>Cline places these and other Biblical stories in solid archaeological and historical context, debunks more than a few lunatic-fringe fantasies, and reserves judgment on ideas that cannot yet be confirmed or denied. Along the way, our most informed understanding of ancient Israel comes alive with dramatic but accurate detail in this groundbreaking, engrossing, entertaining book by one of the rising stars in the field.</p><p>Eric H. Cline holds degrees in classical archaeology, Near Eastern archaeology, and ancient history, and currently serves as chair of the Department of Classical and Semitic Languages and Literatures at George Washington University. A prolific researcher and the prize-winning author of seven books, including <i>The Battles of Armageddon: Megiddo and the Jezreel Valley from the Bronze Age to the Nuclear Age,</i> which won a Biblical Archaeology Society Publication Award for "Best Popular Book on Archaeology" and was a Main Selection of the Natural Science Book Club. He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.Cline, a professor at George Washington University who has written several popular books on biblical studies and archaeology, here turns his attention to some of the most enduring biblical mysteries: Was there really a Garden of Eden, and if so, where was it? What happened to Noah&#39;s ark? Did the Israelites really trek through the desert for 40 years? What happened to the 10 lost tribes of Israel? These are topics that can and have filled up numerous books of their own, but what Cline intends here is a quick overview, a brisk trip through some of the great mysteries of biblical history, advancing his own theories about what happened and mentioning alternative opinions.In the final chapter, on the lost tribes, for example, after offering persuasive arguments for his opinion that most of the Jews of the time fled to Judah or intermarried with the Assyrians, who occupied the land, he then says, definitively, These people were never lost.

His batting average of .406 in 1941 has not been topped since, and no player who has hit more than 500 home runs has a higher career batting average. Those totals would have been even higher if Williams had not left baseball for nearly five years in the prime of his career to serve as a Marine pilot in WWII and Korea. He hit home runs farther than any player before him--and traveled a long way himself, as Ben Bradlee, Jr.'s grand biography reveals. Born in 1918 in San Diego, Ted would spend most of his life disguising his Mexican heritage. During his 22 years with the Boston Red Sox, Williams electrified crowds across America--and shocked them, too: His notorious clashes with the press and fans threatened his reputation. Yet while he was a God in the batter's box, he was profoundly human once he stepped away from the plate. His ferocity came to define his troubled domestic life. While baseball might have been straightforward for Ted Williams, life was not.<br><br>THE KID is biography of the highest literary order, a thrilling and honest account of a legend in all his glory and human complexity. In his final at-bat, Williams hit a home run. Bradlee's marvelous book clears the fences, too.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2013:</strong> In an age of performance enhancing drugs and a culture of wealth and deceit in professional sports, it's refreshing to revisit the feats of one of baseball&#x2019;s best: the last man to hit .400 in a season, with a lifetime .344 batting average, who played remarkable baseball until age 40 and who reigns as the best all-around hitter in history. What sets this exhaustive exploration apart from other Ted Williams biographies is the author's finesse at maintaining a fan's enthusiasm for his remarkable subject while confronting the warts-and-all reality of an imperfect hero. <em>Boston Globe</em> reporter-editor Ben Bradlee Jr. admits at the start that Williams was, indeed, "my hero." Still, Bradlee never shies from dark side of the Williams myth: the insecure immigrant's son; the imperfect father and husband; the raging hothead, who flaunted his disdain for the press and a few teammates. Bradlee spent a decade investigating every detail of Williams&#x2019;s 83 years--and beyond. He even uncovers gruesome tidbits about the strange aftermath of Williams&#x2019;s death in 2002, when his body was taken to a cryonics facility, his head severed and then frozen inside a Tuperware-like container. Passionately researched and artfully told, this is much more than a sports story; it's the sprawling saga of a talented, tenacious, tumultuous, one-of-a-kind American man. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>Ben Bradlee, Jr., spent 25 years at the <i>Boston Globe</i> as a reporter and editor, overseeing as deputy managing editor, among many critically acclaimed stories, the <i>Globe</i>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church.

He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years, and spends much of his free time windsurfing, playing baseball, and hanging out at Doc Ford's Rum Bar &amp; Grille.1<br><br> Marion Ford spent Friday battling traffic, romantic issues, and writing automated replies to thwart future intrusions, and by Tuesday was in the Bahamas distanced by a turquoise sea.<br><br> Isolation. He craved it at junctures, the skin-on-bone reality of a tent, zero electronics, miles of beach to run, the indifference of saltwater, tide, wind. Two books, minimal supplies, a fire starter for abundant driftwood. The process, not time, was spatial. Whatever was enough to quell his own sense of drifting, the weakness granted to sloth, pointless emotion, guilt. Love, too-if "love" existed beyond the chemical bond that, in his experience, clouded reasonable behavior.<br><br> Family was different. Those bonds were inviolable. The same was true of friendship-a select few.<br><br> After a week, he packed his seaplane, a Maule four-seater, and returned to Andros Town not refreshed but newly focused. Luck is an illusion embraced by those who are unprepared. Ford seldom was. Two days later, he struck the trail of the man he wanted to find but had no reason to hurt, let alone kill.<br><br> Someone on the island, he discovered, possibly did.<br><br> The man, a professor turned bureaucrat, was too caught up in Lydia, his former student, to give a damn about being followed, or anything connected with the past. To hell with the past. To hell with bills, his job, his unhappy wife, and the new boss, too, a supercilious business grad-not a qualified maritime archaeologist-who wore Polos to show off his tattoos, for Christ's sake, and was ten years younger.<br><br> "There's nothing wrong with a tat or two," Lydia, no longer a student, had counseled, "or smoking weed, for that matter. You can't smell it on his clothes? I did when I came to your office yesterday to apologize. The real problem is, he's just another ambitious shark. They scare people like us. Admit it."<br><br> This was eight months ago after he'd almost had her arrested for using a metal detector in Ocala National Forest. And he would've done it, called a ranger, if she hadn't . . .<br><br> Well, there were a couple ways to explain why he had fallen under her spell. He remembered her from Advanced Anthropology, a night course for working students. Lydia, bland-faced, thin, always on time, always in the back row, off by herself. They were alike in that way-outsiders, solid, responsible, both subdued by what the mirror had failed to promise every morning since puberty.<br><br> He was five-eight and bald. Lydia, an introvert, averted her eyes while speaking. A slow, voltaic awareness evolved.<br><br> The girl often lingered long enough in the parking lot to call, "Good night, Professor Nickelby." And twice had waited with him for Triple A to jump-start his pathetic old Volvo. Their clumsy small talk was memorable only because she hadn't brought up Indiana Jones. Lambasting Hollywood was how the socialite types denounced a fantasy that had, in fact, flooded archaeology with their kind.<br><br> Not Lydia. The notebook she'd turned in was fastidious. Legible cursive with footnotes in fine block print. No copy-and-paste plagiarism, the new academic norm. And not a single goddamn emoji or doodled happy face.<br><br> One exchange was memorable. The Triple A guy had been busy with paperwork when, out of the blue, she'd asked Nickel by, "Do you ever wonder if things might be fixable? Like your timing's totally off and it's up to you to change, to . . . I don't know, do the unexpected. Something totally . . . risky."<br><br> "I can't afford payments, so I'm stuck," he'd replied. "The timing belt was serviced at seventy thousand, just like the manual says, and, safety-wise, I did the research. Volvos are the least risky when it comes to . . ." He'd rambled on in lecture mode even after realizing he had totally missed her meaning.<br><br> The silence that followed lasted seven years. He married. He changed jobs, although remained an adjunct professor because the State of Florida didn't pay crap. More than once, alone in the stucco confines of a home he couldn't afford, he had replayed that conversation in his head.<br><br> Do you ever wonder if the way things are might be fixable?<br><br> Jesus Christ, he'd been an idiot. The Volvo's timing belt had nothing to do with it. The girl had wanted to explore bigger issues. Archaeology as a profession, possibly. Or she was talking about life. Her life, his life. All screwed-up lives.<br><br> It's up to us to change. To do something . . . risky.<br><br> This was a tantalizing fragment. Had she been addressing their age difference? Him close to tenure, her not yet twenty years old. If so, my god, it was the way a shy student might attempt to seduce an older man without compromising his career.<br><br> That brief voltaic awareness took root as his marriage crumbled. Humiliations he suffered in the bedroom sought refuge in fantasy. The girl, rather cute, not bland at all, came alive in his mind. She had glistening brown hair, a thin body, but not so thin her clothes-jeans and tank tops often-didn't reveal taut hips and small stiletto breasts. Sloped valleys, too, one night in the parking lot when she'd knelt to retrieve a book, then stood as if to prove he was taller.<br><br> The fantasy motivated him to finally do the legwork.<br><br> Lydia Johnson had dropped out midway through her sophomore year. She had forfeited an academic scholarship and a housing grant based on economic need. It made no sense. A straight-A student on the fast track who also had minority status-an unexpected twist. DNA results proved she was nine percent Native American. Documentation had been provided after acceptance.<br><br> This was an eye-opener. Sweet, shy Lydia was also damn savvy. In academia, minority status was the golden umbrella. So why the hell had she left all those perks behind?<br><br> He dug deeper, and it all began to unravel.<br><br> Campus police and a court hearing had been involved. No details. Her record, if any, had been expunged, and the file sealed. A theft of some type, possibly, but more likely drugs-selling, not just using. The dorms would be empty otherwise.<br><br> Fantasy could not tolerate the realities of Dr. Leonard Nickelby's respectable, stuffy world.<br><br> Seven years passed. When he thought of Lydia, which wasn't often, he winced at what might have happened that night in the parking lot. Then, a year ago, there she was in Ocala National Forest, wearing earphones, sweeping a path with a metal detector. He didn't recognize her at first. Not consciously. Then she turned and flipped him the bird in response to what he'd yelled, which was, "That's a felony, you idiot. Don't bother running, I've got you on video."<br><br> It took her a long moment, too. "Professor Nickelby?" The way her face lit up caused him to fumble his phone. Thank god, because he had park headquarters on speed dial. He wouldn't have heard her add, "You have no idea how many times I've thought about you."<br><br> He'd stammered something pompous about switching jobs, and she should consider herself damn lucky to be his former student. Five minutes of talk was all he could spare. Steaks were on, and a group of lobbyists awaited him at a nearby pavilion-a picnic intended to win the ear of government officials.<br><br> "A meat eater," she'd chuckled. "I used to wonder if anyone else saw that side of you. Congratulations. I always knew you'd be a big success."<br><br> Huh?<br><br> The fantasy could not end with another question mark. After three sleepless nights, he would've phoned if she hadn't shown up at his office to "apologize," then suggested they meet the next day.<br><br> "I can't," he told her at the door.<br><br> "You will," she replied. "What worries me is, you'll never understand why."<br><br> Lydia and her cryptic remarks.<br><br> Yet she was correct. They were alone on a riverbank when she referenced his boss, a handsome shark who smoked weed. "They scare us-people who think doing exceptional work will be enough, but it never is. Admit it."<br><br> What he wanted to talk about was that night in the parking lot. Instead, he nodded wisely. "I'm certainly not frightened of him or any of my colleagues, but, for argument's sake, let's say you're right. Is that why you dropped out of school?"<br><br> No, Lydia had been asked to leave-she offered no explanation-and went to work for a treasure salvage company based in West Palm Beach. The company's founder was in jail after refusing to reveal where he'd hidden four hundred million in gold bars and coins.<br><br> "Not surprised, professor? In your new job, you must deal with treasure hunters all the time. They're not all thieves."<br><br> The job wasn't new, he'd been at it six years. He knew enough about the guy to say, "Maybe not, but they're all con men, the way they think, the way they live. You worked for Benthic Exploration? Jimmy Jones must've hired you, so you understand why he's in jail, right?"<br><br> Jimmy and her eighteen months with Benthic were not topics to be discussed. "Benthic was a good group to work for at the time, that's all I know. I learned a lot."<br><br> Lydia's stubborn deference irritated Nickelby. "What? You'd rather be a thieving pirate than sit behind a desk, I suppose, and enforce state statutes."<br><br> "It would be a lot more fun than what I do now, which is doctor cattle for a bona fide creep. Here, relax-" She produced a joint that was twisted at the ends not unlike pre-Columbian cordage.<br><br> "You work on a ranch?"<br><br> "For a vet clinic. My boss is a hormone pusher, the type cattle barons love." Lydia exhaled through her nose and passed the joint to him, a man who didn't drink or use drugs.<br><br> Nickelby felt as if he was dreaming. Stared at the joint between his fingers and worried about residue accumulating on his skin until she said, "Your beat-up old Volvo-do you remember the night we waited for Triple A? I wanted to talk about it then, how to deal with being like us. You know, smart, dependable-conformists by nature-but not other people's idea of . . ."<br><br> "Fashion models?" he suggested when her voice faltered. "You're wrong. I've always found you quite attractive, but-" In a daze, he put the joint to his lips, inhaled, then had to deal with a coughing fit, before explaining, "I was too darn stuffy to take the chance. To do something risky. Those were your exact words."<br><br> Her eyes actually began to tear. "You remember."<br><br> "Of course I do. Almost every night for I don't know how many years." He took a more aggressive hit. "But the age difference . . . If you meant what I think you did in the parking lot, why would you . . . Why me?"<br><br> "I don't date boys," she replied, studying him in a way that meant something. "I never will."<br><br> "Oh come on. You didn't wait all these years just because-"<br><br> "I didn't say that. Waiting and not moving ahead are two different things. I've seen the future too often. Women like me, with brains, and the train wrecks they end up marrying because they're too fat or too thin, or their background isn't quite suitable. Whatever. Another caged bird, professor-that's the way I felt when I met you."<br><br> Her face, framed in smoke, was suddenly lucent in the sunlight. The sense of loss Nickelby felt was numbing. "I . . . I don't know what to say. But, at your age, you truly have no idea of the responsibilities that come with my-"<br><br> "Shut up, Leonard. I'm the only person you've ever met you can say any damn crazy thing that comes into your head, and it'll be okay-as long as it's the truth."<br><br> Her boldness, so unexpected, wasn't an epiphany. More like a kick in the butt toward a door he'd never found the courage to open. "You shouldn't speak to me that way."<br><br> "I just did. After class, all those nights I walked you out, I felt like a fool because-"<br><br> "You don't think I wanted to?" He puffed, held his breath, coughed. "Goddamn right, I wanted to. I was an idiot back then. A coward, okay? Who followed every rule because that's what I've done my entire fucking life. Risk jail and my career for an underage student? Brilliant. But that's exactly what I should've done. I just wish to heck I would've-"<br><br> "You still can," Lydia said. She took a step back, stripped off her tank top, and unsnapped her bra, then held it to her chest, watching him all the while. Several seconds passed before she did it, bared her body for him to see-ribs beneath pale skin, erect nipples-then stood nose to nose. "Do you like?" she whispered.<br><br> "Oh my god . . . Beautiful, yes."<br><br> "I'm not and I never will be. Don't ruin what's real by saying crap like that."<br><br> "You are to me."<br><br> "No more talking." Her fingers found his belt buckle, a metallic sound as it popped free. Next, his zipper as she knelt. Shaded by trees, the river flowed while Lydia made it all become real.<br><br> Eight months later, he was still married but willing to risk everything when she produced a chart of the Bahamas and said, "The next step is, we need money."<br><br> 2<br><br> Mars Bay, South Andros, is a mangrove village born of a freshwater spring, not commerce or ease of access. Ford arrived on a Wednesday, mid-July, and started asking around.<br><br> "I don't understand why people care 'bout a loudmouthed little fella like that," the dive shack owner said. "He was nice enough, kind of fun even, but that voice of his. Sort of high-pitched, like a bird, you know? But formal in an educated way."<br><br> "I'm not the first to ask about those two?"<br><br> The owner's name was Tamarinda Constance, according to the sign. Tamara, for short, she'd told him. She was big-boned, observant, and had appeared slightly bored standing outside her tin-roofed dive shack, beachside. Ford had spent half an hour on pleasantries, discussing local dive spots, before risking a question about the runaway archaeologist who was also a thief.<br><br> "No, sir. A few days back, there was a big fella-well-dressed, he was-with an accent. Cuban, I thought at first, but he had money, so he could be from South America. Spain, maybe. He asked did a man claimed to be an archaeologist come to rent tanks and regulators. What's so important about him?"<br><br> "The guy," Ford said, "supposedly he's the quiet type. Leonard Nickelby. Are you sure we're talking about-"<br><br> "Same name on the dive card he used to rent equipment. Doctor Nickelby, is the way he said it. Bald fella who got louder and louder when him and his girlfriend, or niece-could be, she's so much younger-when they started drinking rum punches over there at the Turtle Kraals Caf&#x17d;." Tamara's eyes swept bayside to a thatched palapa, where there was a driftwood bar, stools upturned on tables, shaded by palms. Overhead, in the high green fronds, parrots rioted in the tradewind heat.</p><h2>The Christmas Quilt (Elm Creek Quilts Series #8)</h2><p>When Christmas Eve comes to Elm Creek Manor, the tenor of the holiday is far from certain. Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt. Begun in seasonal fabrics and patterns, the quilt remains unfinished. <br><br> Sylvia reveals that the handiwork spans several generations and a quartet of Bergstrom quilters -- her great aunt, her mother, her sister, and herself. As she examines the array of quilt blocks each family member contributed but never completed, memories of Christmases past emerge. <br><br> At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues -- joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials -- the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II -- tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. <br><br> Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin. To learn more, visit JenniferChiaverini.com.Chiaverini, author of the Elm Creek Quilts novels, delivers a rich holiday tale that predates last year's <i>Master Quilter</i>, also set during the Christmas season. Sylvia Compson, n�e Bergstrom, 77, is determined to make it the dullest holiday ever at Elm Creek Manor, to which she returned, a year and a half ago, after 50 years of estrangement. Her Bergstrom relatives are gone; her memories of Christmas past are fraught. But young Sarah McClure, Sylvia's partner in the quilting camp that's brought Elm Creek back to life, wants to spend Christmas with Sylvia&#x2014;and she wants it tinsel strewn. Home is here now, not with the mother who dislikes Sarah's husband, Matt. Sylvia reluctantly agrees to visit the trove of ornaments in the attic. As the women discover an unfinished Christmas quilt, a mixed bag of memories spills out along with the feathered star blocks: strudel making in the Depression; tree trimming during World War II, which claimed Sylvia's husband, brother and a baby born too soon because of her shock; memories of a sister, Claudia, who forfeits Sylvia's love until it's too late. Reconciliation and redemption: of course. But it's not won cheaply&#x2014;there's no saccharine in this sweet story. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Right on time, Rosemary Dempsey thought ruefully as she opened her eyes and stirred. Whenever she had a big day ahead she would inevitably wake up in the middle of the night and start worrying that something would go wrong.<br> <br>It had always been like this, even when she was a child. And now, fifty-five years old, happily married for thirty-two years, with one child, beautiful and gifted nineteen-year-old Susan, Rosemary could not be anything but a constant worrier, a living Cassandra. Something is going to go wrong.<br> <br>Thanks again, Mom, Rosemary thought. Thanks for all the times you held your breath, so sure that the birthday upside-down cake I loved to make for Daddy would flop. The only one that did was the first one when I was eight years old. All the others were perfect. I was so proud of myself. But then, on his birthday when I was eighteen, you told me you always made a backup cake for him. In the single act of defiance that I can remember, I was so shocked and angry I tossed the one I had made in the garbage can.<br> <br>You started laughing and then tried to apologize. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that you&#x2019;re talented in other ways, Rosie, but let&#x2019;s face it, in the kitchen you&#x2019;re klutzy.&#x201d;<br> <br>And of course you found other ways to tell me where I was klutzy, Rosemary thought. &#x201c;Rosie, when you make the bed, be sure that the spread is even on both sides. It only takes an extra minute to do it right.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rosie, be careful. When you read a magazine, don&#x2019;t just toss it back on the table. Line it up with the others.&#x201d;<br> <br>And now, even though I know I can throw a party or make a cake, I am always sure that something will go wrong, Rosemary thought.<br> <br>But there was a reason today to be apprehensive. It was Jack&#x2019;s sixtieth birthday, and this evening sixty of their friends would be there to celebrate it. Cocktails and a buffet supper, served on the patio by their infallible caterer. The weather forecast was perfect, sunshine and seventy degrees.<br> <br>It was May 7 in Silicon Valley and that meant that the flowers were in full bloom. Their dream house, the third since they&#x2019;d moved to San Mateo thirty-two years ago, was built in the style of a Tuscan villa. Every time she turned into the driveway, she fell in love with it again.<br> <br>Everything will be fine, she assured herself impatiently. And as usual I&#x2019;ll make the birthday chocolate upside-down cake for Jack and it will be perfect and our friends will have a good time and I will be told how I&#x2019;m a marvel. &#x201c;Your parties are always so perfect, Rosie . . . The supper was delicious . . . the house exquisite . . . ,&#x201d; and on and on. And I will be a nervous wreck inside, she thought, an absolute nervous wreck.<br> <br>Careful not to awaken him, she wriggled her slender body over in the bed until her shoulder was touching Jack&#x2019;s. His even breathing told her that he was enjoying his usual untroubled sleep. And he deserved it. He worked so hard. As she often did when she was trying to overcome one of her worry attacks, Rosemary began to remind herself of all the good things in her life, starting with the day she met Jack on the campus of Marquette University. She had been an undergraduate. He had been a law student. It was the proverbial love at first sight. They had been married after she graduated from college. Jack was fascinated by developing technology, and his conversation became filled with talk of robots, telecommunications, microprocessors, and something called internetworking. Within a year they had moved to Northern California.<br> <br>I always wanted us to live our lives in Milwaukee, Rosemary thought. I still could move back in a heartbeat. Unlike most human beings, I love cold winters. But moving here certainly has worked out for us. Jack is head of the legal department of Valley Tech, one of the top research companies in the country. And Susan was born here. After more than a decade without the family we hoped and prayed for, we were holding her in our arms.<br> <br>Rosemary sighed. To her dismay, Susan, their only child, was a Californian to her fingertips. She&#x2019;d scoff at the idea of relocating anywhere. Rosemary tried to wrest her mind away from the troublesome thought that last year Susan had chosen to go to UCLA, a great college but a full five-hour drive away. She had been accepted closer to home at Stanford University. Instead she had rushed to enroll at UCLA, probably because her no-good boyfriend, Keith Ratner, was already a student there. Dear God, Rosemary thought, don&#x2019;t let her end up eloping with him.<br> <br>The last time she looked at the clock, it was three thirty, and her last impression before falling asleep was once again an overwhelming fear that today something was going to go desperately wrong.</p><h2>The Cholestrol Myths: Exposing the Fallacy That Saturated Fat and Cholesterol Cause Heart Disease</h2><p>A highly qualified doctor and scientist analyzes the studies used to justify the cholesterol hypothesis and demonstrates that the idea that animal fats and cholesterol cause heart disease is based on flimsy, even fraudulent evidence and wishful thinking.

It is also one of the true classics of world literature. <br><br>Traditionally attributed to the near-legendary "Old Master," Lao Tzu, the <i>Tao Teh Ching </i> teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity.</p><p>Not much is known about the legendary Lao Tzu, to whom authorship of the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> is popularly attributed. Some scholars believe the author was an elder contemporary of Confucius.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]</h2><p>A haunting graphic version of one of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s most popular and best-selling novels. <br><br>Bob Arctor is a dealer of the lethally addictive drug Substance D, which he also takes in massive quantities. Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. What Fred doesn&#x2019;t know is that Substance D gradually splits the user&#x2019;s brain into two distinct, combative entities, and that he is, in fact, in frantic pursuit of himself. <br><br><i>A Scanner Darkly</i> is caustically funny and razor sharp in its depiction of drug-induced paranoia and madness; it&#x2019;s an industrial-strength stress test of identity as unnerving as it is riveting. The novel is captured in this brilliant graphic vision, composed entirely of stills from the movie. <br><br>Writer/Director Richard Linklater shot a live-action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, and then animated over the underlying images. The result is an eerily lifelike, richly detailed animation that translates beautifully to the page.</p><p>Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s published works&nbsp;include&nbsp;forty&nbsp;novels and&nbsp;more than one hundred&nbsp;short stories. Many films have been made from his work, including&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, </i>and<i>&nbsp;A Scanner Darkly</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>The Hugo&#x2013;Award&#x2013;winning author died in 1982 at the age of&nbsp;fifty&#x2013;three.Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor told him there were no bugs in his hair. After he had taken a shower for eight hours, standing under hot water hour after hour suffering the pain of the bugs, he got out and dried himself, and he still had bugs in his hair; in fact, he had bugs all over him. A month later he had bugs in his lungs.<br><br>Having nothing else to do or think about, he began to work out theoretically the life cycle of the bugs, and, with the aid of the Britannica, try to determine specifically which bugs they were. They now filled his house. He read about many different kinds and finally noticed bugs outdoors, so he concluded they were aphids. After that decision came to his mind it never changed, no matter what other people told him ... like "Aphids don't bite people."<br><br>They said that to him because the endless biting of the bugs kept him in torment. At the 7-11 grocery store, part of a chain spread out over most of California, he bought spray cans of Raid and Black Flag and Yard Guard. First he sprayed the house, then himself. The Yard Guard seemed to work the best.<br><br>As to the theoretical side, he perceived three stages in the cycle of the bugs. First, they were carried to him to contaminate him by what he called Carrier-people, which were people who didn't understand their role in distributing the bugs. During that stage the bugs had no jaws or mandibles (he learned that word during his weeks of scholarly research, an unusually bookish occupation for a guy who worked at the Handy Brake and Tire place relining people's brake drums). The Carrier-people therefore felt nothing. He used to sit in the far corner of his living room watching different Carrier-people enter--most of them people he'd known for a while, but some new to him--covered with the aphids in this particular nonbiting stage. He'd sort of smile to himself, because he knew that the person was being used by the bugs and wasn't hip to it.<br><br>"What are you grinning about, Jerry?" they'd say.<br><br>He'd just smile.<br><br>In the next stage the bugs grew wings or something, but they really weren't precisely wings; anyhow, they were appendages of a functional sort permitting them to swarm, which was how they migrated and spread--especially to him. At that point the air was full of them; it made his living room, his whole house, cloudy. During this stage he tried not to inhale them.<br><br>Most of all he felt sorry for his dog, because he could see the bugs landing on and settling all over him, and probably getting into the dog's lungs, as they were in his own. Probably--at least so his empathic ability told him--the dog was suffering as much as he was. Should he give the dog away for the dog's own comfort? No, he decided: the dog was now, inadvertently, infected, and would carry the bugs with him everywhere.<br><br>Sometimes he stood in the shower with the dog, trying to wash the dog clean too. He had no more success with him than he did with himself. It hurt to feel the dog suffer; he never stopped trying to help him. In some respect this was the worst part, the suffering of the animal, who could not complain.<br><br>"What the fuck are you doing there all day in the shower with the goddamn dog?" his buddy Charles Freck asked one time, coming in during this.<br><br>Jerry said, "I got to get the aphids off him." He brought Max, the dog, out of the shower and began drying him. Charles Freck watched, mystified, as Jerry rubbed baby oil and talc into the dog's fur. All over the house, cans of insect spray, bottles of talc, and baby oil and skin conditioners were piled and tossed, most of them empty; he used many cans a day now.<br><br>"I don't see any aphids," Charles said. "What's an aphid?"<br><br>"It eventually kills you," Jerry said. "That's what an aphid is. They're in my hair and my skin and my lungs, and the goddamn pain is unbearable--I'm going to have to go to the hospital."<br><br>"How come I can't see them?"<br><br>Jerry put down the dog, which was wrapped in a towel, and knelt over the shag rug. "I'll show you one," he said. The rug was covered with aphids; they hopped up everywhere, up and down, some higher than others. He searched for an especially large one, because of the difficulty people had seeing them. "Bring me a bottle or jar," he said, "from under the sink. We'll cap it or put a lid on it and then I can take it with me when I go to the doctor and he can analyze it."<br><br>Charles Freck brought him an empty mayonnaise jar. Jerry went on searching, and at last came across an aphid leaping up at least four feet in the air. The aphid was over an inch long. He caught it, carried it to the jar, carefully dropped it in, and screwed on the lid. Then he held it up triumphantly. "See?" he said.<br><br>"Yeahhhhh," Charles Freck said, his eyes wide as he scrutinized the contents of the jar. "What a big one! Wow!"<br><br>"Help me find more for the doctor to see," Jerry said, again squatting down on the rug, the jar beside him.<br><br>"Sure," Charles Freck said, and did so.<br><br>Within half an hour they had three jars full of the bugs. Charles, although new at it, found some of the largest.<br><br>It was midday, in June of 1994. In California, in a tract area of cheap but durable plastic houses, long ago vacated by the straights. Jerry had at an earlier date sprayed metal paint over all the windows, though, to keep out the light; the illumination for the room came from a pole lamp into which he had screwed nothing but spot lamps, which shone day and night, so as to abolish time for him and his friends. He liked that; he liked to get rid of time. By doing that he could concentrate on important things without interruption. Like this: two men kneeling down on the shag rug, finding bug after bug and putting them into jar after jar.<br><br>"What do we get for these," Charles Freck said, later on in the day. "I mean, does the doctor pay a bounty or something? A prize? Any bread?"<br><br>"I get to help perfect a cure for them this way," Jerry said. The pain, constant as it was, had become unbearable; he had never gotten used to it, and he knew he never would. The urge, the longing, to take another shower was overwhelming him. "Hey, man," he gasped, straightening up, "you go on putting them in the jars while I take a leak and like that." He started toward the bathroom.<br><br>"Okay," Charles said, his long legs wobbling as he swung toward a jar, both hands cupped. An ex-veteran, he still had good muscular control, though; he made it to the jar. But then he said suddenly, "Jerry, hey--those bugs sort of scare me. I don't like it here by myself." He stood up.<br><br>"Chickenshit bastard," Jerry said, panting with pain as he halted momentarily at the bathroom.<br><br>"Couldn't you--"<br><br>"I got to take a leak!" He slammed the door and spun the knobs of the shower. Water poured down.<br><br>"I'm afraid out here." Charles Freck's voice came dimly, even though he was evidently yelling loud.<br><br>"Then go fuck yourself!" Jerry yelled back, and stepped into the shower. What fucking good are friends? he asked himself bitterly. No good, no good! No fucking good!<br><br>"Do these fuckers sting?" Charles yelled, right at the door.<br><br>"Yeah, they sting," Jerry said as he rubbed shampoo into his hair.<br><br>"That's what I thought." A pause. "Can I wash my hands and get them off and wait for you?"<br><br>Chickenshit, Jerry thought with bitter fury. He said nothing; he merely kept on washing. The bastard wasn't worth answering ... He paid no attention to Charles Freck, only to himself. To his own vital, demanding, terrible, urgent needs. Everything else would have to wait. There was no time, no time; these things could not be postponed. Everything else was secondary. Except the dog; he wondered about Max, the dog.<br><br>Charles Freck phoned up somebody who he hoped was holding, "Can you lay about ten deaths on me?"<br><br>"Christ, I'm entirely out--I'm looking to score myself. Let me know when you find some, I could use some."<br><br>"What's wrong with the supply?"<br><br>"Some busts, I guess."<br><br>Charles Freck hung up and then ran a fantasy number in his head as he slumped dismally back from the pay phone booth--you never used your home phone for a buy call--to his parked Chevy. In his fantasy number he was driving past the Thrifty Drugstore and they had a huge window display; bottles of slow death, cans of slow death, jars and bathtubs and vats and bowls of slow death, millions of caps and tabs and hits of slow death, slow death mixed with speed and junk and barbiturates and psychedelics, everything--and a giant sign: YOUR CREDIT IS GOOD HERE. Not to mention: LOW LOW PRICES, LOWEST IN TOWN.<br><br>But in actuality the Thrifty usually had a display of nothing: combs, bottles of mineral oil, spray cans of deodorant, always crap like that. But I bet the pharmacy in the back has slow death under lock and key in an unstepped-on, pure, unadulterated, uncut form, he thought as he drove from the parking lot onto Harbor Boulevard, into the afternoon traffic. About a fifty-pound bag.<br><br>He wondered when and how they unloaded the fifty-pound bag of Substance D at the Thrifty Pharmacy every morning, from wherever it came from--God knew, maybe from Switzerland or maybe from another planet where some wise race lived. They'd deliver probably real early, and with armed guards--the Man standing there with Laser rifles looking mean, the way the Man always did. Anybody rip off my slow death, he thought through the Man's head, I'll snuff them.<br><br>Probably Substance D is an ingredient in every legal medication that's worth anything, he thought.

Her eight public decks were all served by elevators, and with her casino, gymnasium, outdoor pools, bars, gift shops, sports deck--all the usual amenities--the <em>Star</em>was the pride of her line. Of an evening, her 1,400-plus passengers could choose to relax in the Moulin Rouge lounge or the All That Jazz show bar, dance the night away in the Sierra Ballroom, or simply sit and be serenaded, watching the sunset from the panoramic sundeck.<br>This being the <em>Star</em>&#x2018;s last voyage of the season, however, last night had been a little different. A mid-cruise &#x201c;extravaganza,&#x201c; the extra glitz of its shows and its grand finale--a fireworks display from the stern, lighting the Aegean sky with dazzling spirals and brilliant, thunderclap bomb-bursts--had been one of the highlights of the voyage; the locals ashore in Mytilene on the island of Lesbos had enjoyed it as much as the passengers aboard. Add to this cuisine straight out of a gourmet&#x2019;s dream of paradise, and it was easy to see why the onboard partying had gone on and on through the night, and why the run on the champagne locker had seemed unending...<br>But all good things do come to an end.<br>Now...it was early morning of a Monday in October, and in the galley breakfast was being prepared for those who still had the stomach for yet more food, while those who didn&#x2019;t slept off their excesses. A few younger passengers were up and about, making the most of the pools while yet they had them to themselves, and as if emulating their energy a pod of dolphins, like so many silver minisubmarines, played chicken on the bow wave, crisscrossing the prow just beneath a sparkling surface that was so flat calm it might well be a horizon-spanning plate of diamond-etched glass. While the sun had risen no more than half an hour ago, already the deck rails were warm from its rays.<br>Perfect!<br>So thought Purser Bill Galliard where he strolled the main deck for&#x2019;ard, having risen early to prepare the shore excursion roster for the <em>Star</em>&#x2018;s midday visit to the picturesque island of L�mnos Thus far the cruise had gone precisely to plan, without a hitch, and Galliard had wanted to do his bit to ensure things stayed that way. Now that he&#x2019;d finished with the Limnos documentation, he could take it easy for an hour or so, at least until the bulk of the passengers were astir and those who desired to go ashore were readying themselves for terra firma.<br>Now in the very prow of the ship, forty feet above and forward of the spot where the knifelike stem sliced the water, he leaned on the deck rail and looked out across the vast curve of the ocean. No land in sight, but Galliard came from a long line of deckhands; he knew how quickly land masses could take shape on the horizon, especially in the Aegean, looming up as if from nowhere into cloud-capped mountain ranges. And with the cooling breeze of the vessel&#x2019;s forward motion in his face, and the hiss of parted waters in his ears, he reflected on the trip so far.<br>Most of the passengers were middle-aged, comfortably well-to-do, generally easygoing Brits, and the crew was composed of a British captain, officers and senior stewards, supported by a largely Greek Cypriot body of deckhands, engineers, chefs, and an &#x201c;international&#x201d; lineup of entertainers. The passengers had flown out from England to Cyprus, joining the cruise in Limassol. After a week of sailing they would return to Cyprus before flying home.<br>Sailing from Limassol on Thursday evening, the <em>Evening Star</em>had cruised all day Friday, providing an ideal opportunity for the passengers to get to know the vessel and fellow holidaymakers. Saturday it had been &#x201c;all ashore who&#x2019;s going ashore&#x201d; in V�los on the Greek mainland, and Purser Bill had taken time out to visit friends in their villa at the foot of Mount Pelion, also to pick up some gifts in V�los&#x2019;s bustling bazaar for the folks back home. Sunday they&#x2019;d cruised to Lesbos and Mytilene, where the sightseers had gone ashore again, and last night had been the food and fireworks fest.<br>That brought Galliard up to date. The next port of call in some four hours&#x2019; time would be L�mnos&#x2019;s new deep-water harbour, and tomorrow they&#x2019;d be through the Dardanelles on their way to Istanbul. But that was to look too far ahead, and cruises such as this were best taken one day at a time.<br>As he thought these things through, Galliard had been idly scanning the forward horizon. A moment ago--if only for a moment--he&#x2019;d caught sight of something in direct line ahead. The fact hadn&#x2019;t made a great impact on him; shipping of one sort or another can be found any time in Mediterranean waters, and just about anywhere. Anyway, it had been a flash of white on a glittering surface...maybe a dolphin had leaped clear of the water and the splashdown had caught his eye. But--<br>Purser Galliard stepped to one of two telescopes mounted on the rail and focussed ahead. For a while there was nothing, but the...now what was that? A Greek ca�que? Just sitting there, all these miles from the nearest island? Nothing peculiar about the boat itself; the islands were full of them--like gondolas in Venice--but they usually stuck pretty close to shore. This one looked becalmed, and it simply shouldn&#x2019;t be here.<br>The canopied boat was maybe three-quarters of a mile ahead--but dead ahead--and it definitely wasn&#x2019;t moving!<br>Galliard took out his on-board communicator and pressed 1 for the bridge three decks higher. His call sign was recognized, and a voice answered, &#x201c;Bridge. What can we do for you, Purser Bill?&#x201d; It was Captain Geoff Anderson, informal as ever.<br>&#x201c;You might try swinging her a tad to port and calling full stop on all engines,&#x201c; Galliard told him at once. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re about a minute and a half from running someone down!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201c; came the terse answer, and ten seconds later: &#x201c;Well done, Purser Bill. We would have seen and cleared her okay, but if they need help we&#x2019;d have had to slow down and come about. So you&#x2019;ve saved us some time and a little embarrassment, possibly. Now for your trouble you can arm yourself with a hailer and get down starboard onto B deck, okay?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, Cap&#x2019;n,&#x201c; Galliard answered with a grin, heading at the double for his office amidships. After only a few paces, he was gratified to feel the gentle shudder of a sudden deceleration, the barely noticeable shifting underfoot as the <em>Star</em>began veering a few degrees to port... <br>* * *<br>From just below the surface of B deck (the vessel&#x2019;s basement) a section of the hull had been rotated outwards to form stairs. And from the bottom step, Purser Bill Galliard threw out a line to the tattered-looking man in the shade of the ca�que&#x2019;s canopy. Accompanied by three stewards and a deckhand, Galliard watched as the figure of the man in the ca�que made fast the line, then began to haul his boat in alongside.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201c; Galliard called out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that. You just sit tight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Water,&#x201c; the shaded, crumpled-seeming man answered him, his voice a dry croak. &#x201c;The lady and I...we&#x2019;re burning up.&#x201d;<br>A lady? That must be the second figure, lying supine between the thwarts. Even as Galliard drew the ca�que alongside, he saw her jewel-green eyes flicker open to fix his own, in the moment before a luminous glow suffused her face, making it indistinct. And:<br><em>God, she&#x2019;s beautiful</em>! he thought...before wondering where that idea had come from, since as yet she was barely visible in the shade of the boat&#x2019;s canopy, which made a jet-black contrast with the blinding sunlight.<br>&#x201c;Shade,&#x201c; said the gaunt, ragged figure of the man, standing hunched under the canopy. &#x201c;The sun. We have...suffered!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We have juice,&#x201c; said Galliard, passing a pitcher down. &#x201c;Sip a little. It will ease your throats, give you strength. But how long have you been out here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Too long,&#x201c; said the other, sipping and passing the pitcher to the woman, then reaching out a hand to Galliard. &#x201c;Help me to get her up there.&#x201d;<br>The purser took his hand, and felt its chill. Strange, on a day as hot as this to feel a hand so cold. Stranger by far that the hand seemed to smoke in the sunlight! But Galliard was much too busy, too concerned, to wonder about the apparent contradictions here. The woman was heavily muffled; wrapped head to toe, she seemed almost mummified as she struggled to her feet, tottering where she emerged into the light. Galliard leaned forward, held to the rail with one hand and caught her round her slender waist with the other. She stepped--was lifted up--from the boat to the stairs, and her man-friend close behind, apparently eager to enter into the shade of the ship.<br>&#x201c;But what on earth happened here?&#x201d; Galliard enquired, as he and the stewards assisted the pair up into the ship and towards the elevators, and the deckhand left to go about his business. &#x201c;I mean, that you got into trouble, adrift way out here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We ran out of fuel,&#x201c; said the man, throwing off the jacket he&#x2019;d been using to cover his head. &#x201c;We were taken by an unusual tide off Krassos. We used up our fuel trying to get back to the island. A little jaunt turned into a nightmare.&#x201d;<br>His story sounded incredible: that even in this mad El Ni�o summer they&#x2019;d been lost in the Aegean--adrift and going unnoticed through all the regular shipping routes--long enough to have become so dehydrated and so badly burned. But on the other hand it must be true, for the condition of the pair admitted of no other explan...</p></p><h2>Basic Flower Painting Techniques in Watercolor: Techniques in Watercolor (Basic Techniques)</h2><p>This book will show you how watercolor painters capture their subjects brilliant colors</p><p><p><b>Rachel Rubin Wolf</b> is the longtime editor of North Light's popular <i>Splash</i> book series as well as <i>Strokes of Genius</i>.

Among those navigating it all are a resourceful pair of abandoned sisters; a lonely boy, grown up; a restless, childless couple, a searching, homeless woman; and an unforgettable, recurring character - a steely and conflicted wife and mother. <br><br>The stories in this collection span characters, towns, decades, even centuries, but Florida--its landscape, climate, history, and state of mind--becomes its gravitational center: an energy, a mood, as much as a place of residence. Groff transports the reader, then jolts us alert with a crackle of wit, a wave of sadness, a flash of cruelty, as she writes about loneliness, rage, family, and the passage of time. With shocking accuracy and effect, she pinpoints the moments and decisions and connections behind human pleasure and pain, hope and despair, love and fury--the moments that make us alive.

Most of us avoid thinking about what happens when oil runs out (or becomes prohibitively expensive), but <em>The Transition Handbook</em> shows how the inevitable and profound changes ahead can have a positive outcome. These changes can lead to the rebirth of local communities that will grow more of their own food, generate their own power, and build their own houses using local materials.

Hopkins takes our 'addiction' to oil literally, and so we will read of 'post-petroleum stress disorder,' and see applied addictions psychology helping to ease the townies' withdrawal symptoms.

Peak oil and climate change can so often leave one feeling depressed and disempowered. What I love about the Transition approach is that it is inspirational, harnessing hope instead of guilt, and optimism instead of fear. <em>The Transition Handbook</em> will come to be seen as one of the seminal books which emerged at the end of the Oil Age and which offered a gentle helping hand in the transition to a more local, more human and ultimately more nourishing future."<strong>--Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association</strong></p><br><br><p>"If ever there was a book that empowered the reader, this is it. I'm struggling here to escape metaphors about having a tankful of petrol in my belly, but that's just what it feels like. Rob tells us that fossil fuels multiply the physical force of each human being by 70 times. Well, this book can do the same, but in a social way rather than a brute mechanical way, and to a positive end rather than a destructive one. It's not only a powerful read, but an easy one too. It flows along like a well-written novel, full of illustrations, well designed and produced. Anyone who has met Rob or heard him speak in public will recognize in its words the humor, power and humility of this remarkable person. The book is of course a product of the cheap oil era. But if we can create things of this quality, when the post-peak times come we have little to fear."<strong>--Patrick Whitefield, <em>Permaculture </em>magazine</strong></p><br><br><p>"The newly published <em>Transition Handbook</em> is so important that I am tempted just to confine this review to five simple words: 'You must read this book!'"<strong>--Richard Barnett, <em>Ethical Pulse</em></strong></p></p><h2>Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators in The Mystery of the Shrinking House</h2><p>The Three Investigators solve a case involving an international gang of art forgers.</p><p></p><h2>A Prayer for Owen Meany: A Novel (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>John Irving&#x2019;s<b> A Prayer for Owen Meany</b> is the inspiring modern classic that introduced two of the author&#x2019;s most unforgettable characters, boys bonded forever in childhood: the stunted Owen Meany, whose life is touched by God, and the orphaned Johnny Wheelwright, whose life is touched by Owen. From the accident that links them to the mystery that follows them&#x2013;and the martyrdom that parts them&#x2013;the events of their lives form a tapestry of fate and faith in a novel that is Irving at his irresistible best.</p><p>Owen Meany is a dwarfish boy with a strange voice who accidentally kills his best friend's mom with a baseball and believes--accurately--that he is an instrument of God, to be redeemed by martyrdom. John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movie <i>Simon Birch</i>, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel since Flannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, the Garp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, as <i>Highlights</i> magazine used to put it, "fun with a purpose." When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enacting <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that he <i>was</i> born to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras. <p> The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies's Deptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel, <i>Fifth Business</i>. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher G�nter Grass's <i>The Tin Drum</i>--the two characters share the same initials. A rollicking entertainment, <i>Owen Meany</i> is also a meditation on literature, history, and God. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>I have been a voracious reader since childhood, and while I've read and loved many, many books, I can honestly say that A Prayer for Owen Meany is my all-time favorite! It is such an extraordinarily funny, moving and heartbreaking story and then ending is the best and most satisfying one I've ever read. The highlight of my first year working for Ballantine Books was attending a reading John Irving gave for the paperback publication. Owen Meany has a very memorable voice when you read the book, so you can imagine how exciting it was for me to hear my favorite author read my favorite book and DO THE VOICE OF OWEN MEANY!<br><br>M.

In an era where everyone seems bought and paid for, they cut through it all to tell it like it is. For Fall 2000--just in time to enter the fray for the presidential election season-St. Martin's is happy to present the most unfettered voice of all, Larry Elder. <br><br>Larry Elder has been igniting passions and conversations for five years at the top of the competitive drive-time radio heap, KABC in Los Angeles-the "Sage from South Central" punctures pretensions, refuses to accept the accepted wisdom, and puts everyone on notice that the status quo needs to be shaken up. From his outrage over the entrenched "victicrat" society and how it keeps believers spinning their wheels, to his trenchant observations on work, leadership, race, special interests, politics and more, Larry is a clarion voice that cuts through what the usual suspects say and hear.<br><br>"Bad schools, crime, drugs, high taxes, the social security mess, racism, the health care crisis, unemployment, welfare state dependency, illegitimacy. What do these issues have in common? Politicians, the media and our so-called leaders lie to us about them. They lie about the cause. They lie about the effect. They lie about the solutions." -- Larry Elder<br><br>The Ten Things You Can't Say In America:<br><br>Blacks are More Racist than Whites<br>White Condescension is as Real as Black Racism<br>The Media Bias: It's Real, It's Widespread, It's Destructive<br>The Glass Ceiling: Full of Holes<br>America's Greatest Problem: Illegitimacy<br>The Big Lie: Our Health Care Crisis<br>The Welfare State: Helping Us to Death<br>Republican v. Democrat: Maybe a Dime's worth of Difference, One's for Big Government, One's for Bigger<br>Vietnam II: The War on Drugs, and We're Losing that One Too<br>Gun Control Advocates: Good Guys with Blood on Their Hands<br></p><p>When Larry Elder talks, sparks fly, and he likes it that way. Fans of the radio talk-show host from Los Angeles, who call themselves Elderados, have dubbed him "the sage from South Central." His critics--and there are many--use names that range from Oreo to the Antichrist. What's it all about? Elder, a libertarian, lays down his controversial views in his first book, which attacks the politically correct, black leaders, feminists, gun-control advocates, and other "so-called liberals." Some of the 10 things you can't say in America include "Blacks are more racist than whites," "There's only a dime's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats," "The media bias is real, widespread and destructive," and "America's greatest problem is illegitimacy." Elder aims to change the way blacks look at their future, demanding that they take responsibility for their lives, stop blaming all their problems on racism, and pay attention to the progress they've made. While there may be some truth in what he says and even some good news (for instance, the self-esteem of black children is equal to or better than that of whites), this isn't exactly a pep talk. Not surprisingly, his all-out attack on black leaders (whom he calls nutcases and hysterical) and white liberals has engendered a fair amount of hostility. With this kind of dialogue, it's hard to believe Elder's going to win too many converts. But for those who appreciate his views, or are curious about them, this book is a provocative and lively ride into the mind of one of the nation's most outspoken black libertarians. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>Larry Elder is the nation's #1 drive-time radio host, from 3 to 7PM on KABC in Los Angeles.

Here, Mexico's classic salsas get put to work in our kitchens in the same way we use a variety of international condiments, from teriyaki sauce to balsamic vinegar, to enliven and redefine the flavor of many American favorites. While most of us have enjoyed salsas as chip dips, salsas show great versatility when weaving complex flavor into simple dishes, from pasta to potatoes to meats, fish and vegetables.<br> <br>Salsas embody the essence of Mexican flavor: the lusciousness of slow-roasted tomatoes, the full-flavored spice of chiles, the fragrance of cilantro and the mellow sweetness of garlic. Rick Bayless, the country's leading progenitor of real Mexican cooking, writes the six salsa recipes with such detail and personality that even beginning cooks will turn out masterful creations.<br> <br>The uniqueness of this book, though, is in the way these six salsas are used. Here they give their pizzazz to chile-glazed roast chicken, grilled pork tenderloin and seared sea scallops with jalape�o cream. Familiar Mexican favorites have always used salsas for vitality, and many are here, from tangy guacamole to tortilla soup and grilled chicken tacos. In <i>Salsas That Cook,</i> the magic of Mexico transcends all borders.</p><p>There's a lot more going on with salsa than its traditional role as a dip or dunk for corn chips. Rick Bayless, author of the bestselling Mexican Kitchen, is on a mission to prove to home cooks everywhere that this spicy sauce adds oomph to pasta, zest to meats, passion to potatoes, and invigoration to vegetables. Bayless takes six salsas (which can be made in the comfort of your own home or bought via mail order) and then uses them in more than 50 recipes, including a fiery tequila chaser! His Layered Tortilla Lasagna with Greens and Cheese captures a piece of both Italy and Mexico for one tasty little number. Chipolte-Cascabel Salsa is the key ingredient, which is combined with tortillas, three cheeses, heavy cream, corn, spinach, and mushrooms. Following the simple step-by-step instructions, you can concoct this as a main course for 8 or as appetizers for 16 in less than an hour. Even salad benefits from a brush with salsa. Particularly captivating is Bayless's Poblano Roasted Vegetable Salad with Peppery Watercress. Here a colorful combination of beets, fennel, watercress, potatoes, salted farmer cheese, and the Roasted Poblano Tomato salsa make for a wild and wonderful salad. Even desserts put in an appearance, although they are salsa-free!<p> Full-color photographs and many innovative ideas for spicing up mealtimes make <i>Salsas That Cook</i> a flavorsome addition to the home kitchen. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Rick Bayless is the coauthor of <i>Authentic Mexican</i> and <i>Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen,</i> for which he won the IACP Cookbook of the Year Award.

John Rebus&#39;s reputation precedes him, and his bosses don&#39;t want him anywhere near Presidents Bush and Putin, which explains why he&#39;s manning an abandoned police station when a call comes in. During a preconference dinner at Edinburgh Castle, a delegate has fallen to his death. Accident, suicide, or something altogether more sinister? And is it linked to a grisly find close to the site of the gathering? Are the world&#39;s most powerful men at risk from a killer? While the government and secret services attempt to hush the whole thing up, Rebus knows he has only seventy-two hours to find the answers.</p><p>Ian Rankin is a #1 International best selling author.

As if thats not bad enough, the G8 has the powers-that-be pulling rank and declaring that the death of the Assistant Minister of International Development is a suicide. Rebus doesnt agree and adds one more murder to his already full plate.

A Thai Lullaby</h2><p>A lullaby asks animals such as a lizard, monkey, and water-buffalo to be quiet and not disturb the sleeping baby</p><p>From the author of A Clay Marble (1991), a charming, repetitive rhyme (subtitled ``A Thai Lullaby'') in which a mother shushes all the creatures, from a tiny mosquito to a huge elephant, in and around her thatch-roofed house so that her baby can sleep in the blue cloth hammock. However, sharp-eyed readers will notice that each time the mother's back is turned, the child climbs out of the hammock to play. At the end, everyone, including the unsuspecting mother, is asleep--but not the baby! Exceptionally beautiful cut-paper-and-ink illustrations in earth tones use the varied textures of the paper to wonderful effect, depicting traditional Thai textiles, basketry, and building styles. All of young children's favorite elements are here: a reassuringly predictable, rhyming text, animals and their sounds, a mischievous subplot in the pictures, and an ever-so-slightly naughty child who fools everyone in the end. A sure winner. (Picture book. 2-6) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>PreSchool-K?A mother, having just put her toddler to sleep, says "Hush!" to a succession of noises around her and finds out which animal is making each sound. Eventually, she hushes her whole environment and falls asleep as her baby awakens. Ho's rhymed, repetitive, onomatopoetic text employs the question-and-answer format of Bill Martin's classic Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? (Holt, 1967), creating a lullaby without music. The lilting sounds, variety of wildlife (monkeys, water buffalo, elephant, etc.), and illustrations firmly anchor this mood piece in northern Thailand. Pictures combine cut paper, ink line, and watercolor in a lush, yet successfully somnolent atmosphere of browns and greens. The art greatly amplifies the text with warmth and humor as the mother makes her rounds ensuring her child's peace.

Now, for the first time, her beautiful work -- arguably the most exquisite collection of Victorian flower paintings in existence -- can be appreciated by all.</p><p>Fanny's exceptional book combines elegant watercolors with evocative poetry that is finely illuminated in the manner of a medieval Book of Hours. Using the symbolic Language of Flowers, she invests each flower grouping with subtle and often highly romantic meanings -- indeed, it is thought that the volume was intended as a lasting tribute to a lost lover.</p><p>In her fascinating commentary on the paintings, Gill Saunders, a senior curator in the Department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, explains the intriguing floral symbolism and takes the reader on a delightful journey into Fanny Robinson's leisured and cultivated world of flower, pen and brush.</p></p><p>With its wealth of charming watercolors, poems, and notes on the language of flowers, <i>The Country Flowers of a Victorian Lady</i> is destined to be a coffee-table fixture in the home of any lover of old-fashioned flowers. Kept as a private family keepsake for several generations, this gorgeous book was originally created by Fanny Robinson, who lived a quiet English country life in the last half of the 19th century. The rich, creamy paper provides a perfect backdrop for Robinson's drawings, and for those who have difficulty reading ornate penmanship, her fanciful poetry is copied onto each painting's facing page in an easily readable typeface. Most flowers tend toward the fragrantly romantic--scented geraniums, violets, pansies, and rosebuds of all types appear frequently--and researcher Gill Saunders provides fascinating comments on the historical language of flowers, providing a contextual framework to Robinson's poetry and pictures. One print shows a flowing nosegay of pansies, fuchsia, yew, and Canterbury bells, with this accompanying poem: "I have here only a nosegay of culled / flowers and have brought nothing / of my own, but the string that ties them." When we learn that pansies were sent to loved ones as a token of remembrance, and that yew was "an emblem of sadness and sorrow," readers are given a clear view not just of exquisite art but of the emotions that gave rise to that particular painting. There are plenty of happier pages as well--seasonal celebrations, love poems, memories of childhood--that gardeners, historians, poets, and artists will love.

McManus has written a gripping history that will stand as the last word on this titanic battle. </b><br><br>Nicknamed the Big Red One, 1st Division had fought from North Africa to Sicily, earning a reputation as stalwart warriors on the front lines and rabble-rousers in the rear. Yet on D-Day, these jaded combat veterans melded with fresh-faced replacements to accomplish one of the most challenging and deadly missions ever. As the men hit the beach, their equipment destroyed or washed away, soldiers cut down by the dozens, courageous heroes emerged: men such as Sergeant Raymond Strojny, who grabbed a bazooka and engaged in a death duel with a fortified German antitank gun; T/5 Joe Pinder, a former minor-league pitcher who braved enemy fire to save a vital radio; Lieutenant John Spalding, a former sportswriter, and Sergeant Phil Streczyk, a truck driver, who together demolished a German strong point overlooking Easy Red, where hundreds of Americans had landed.<br><br>Along the way, McManus explores the Gap Assault Team engineers who dealt with the extensive mines and obstacles, suffering nearly a fifty percent casualty rate; highlights officers such as Brigadier General Willard Wyman and Colonel George Taylor, who led the way to victory; and punctures scores of myths surrounding this long-misunderstood battle.<br><br><i>The Dead and Those About to Die</i> draws on a rich array of new or recently unearthed sources, including interviews with veterans. The result is history at its finest, the unforgettable story of the Big Red One&#x2019;s nineteen hours of hell&#x2014;and their ultimate triumph&#x2014;on June 6, 1944.<br><br><b>INCLUDES PHOTOGRAPHS</b></p><p><b>John C.

The humble tamale pie, lowly turkey hash, and ordinary ham loaf become truly memorable in his capable hands. His Texas Chili may be the best anyone has ever tasted. Mulacalong Chicken, a specialty of Charleston, South Carolina, has a soft curry flavor that's indescribably wonderful.

For example, Milwaukee Potato Soup has a base of grated potatoes for thickening and flavor, as well as two different sizes of diced potatoes for texture.</p><p>Other formerly "inelegant" dishes are treated to the remarkable -- and frequently unorthodox-Chef Paul touch, to create food no one is likely to soon forget: A slow -- roasted, boneless stuffed chicken emerges juicy and brimming with flavor in Atchafalaya Boneless Roast Chicken.

Spinners around the world have explored new yarn techniques from her DVD <i>Sit &amp; Spin</i> and her spinning workshops. She teaches through guilds, yarn shops, and at national and international events. She is a regular contributor to <i>Spin-Off</i> magazine. She lives in Missouri.</p><p>"One of the things I love about Jacey Boggs as a teacher is that she doesn't mess around by saying what she's teaching is quick or easy. She firmly states that you have to be able to spin to make textured yarns, and the better spinner you are the better texture yarns you will make and the more the process will make sense. There are 8 different types of yarn to make with this book, each building on the skill set of the one before it. She starts the book with a basic wrap technique and ends with a three layered yarn that is the spinning equivalent of rubbing your stomach, patting your head and dancing a jig all at the same time. In between she teaches about loop, coils, corespinning, beehives and all of the combinations of skills that make up the yarns that Jacey is known for and has been teaching around the world. There are typically 4-6 photos for each technique in this book and 2 of those are (really gorgeous) beauty shots. The remaining photos exactly illustrate the crux of making each yarn. These process shots were clearly chosen by Jacey herself. Each yarn technique is broken down into numbered written steps and explained in mechanical detail: set your wheel up this way, your fiber hand does this and your drafting hand does this. There is no magic. With this book, you learn yarn making in a way that is a repeatable, intentional yarn. You can look at the pictures and read the words and watch the DVD to have the lessons soak into your spinning mind through a variety of learning styles. The DVD follows each of the yarn lessons in the book -- it's very straightforward. It's great to see Jacey spin at her regular pace and also slowed down, so you can see the steps. I found myself rewinding to watch parts over and over. I will repeat that you have to know how to spin already to use this book; it's not for beginners. Even the most determined beginner might find themselves in a puddle of tears and cusswords if you try to leap straight into this type of yarn making. If you do know how to spin the basics, this book and DVD are an excellent learning experience." - Knitty.com</p><p>"The production quality of the DVD is great, providing a high level of detail and material that coordinates nicely with the book." - <i>Knitcircus</i></p></p><h2>Gnomes Deluxe Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>The delightful classic <i>Gnomes</i> has been repackaged in this exceptional collector's edition to celebrate the 35th anniversary of this magical book.

Starting with Alexander Graham Bell&#x2019;s revolutionary harmonic telegraph,&#x201d; by the middle of the twentieth century the phone system had grown into something extraordinary, a web of cutting-edge switching machines and human operators that linked together millions of people like never before. But the network had a billion-dollar flaw, and once people discovered it, things would never be the same.<br><br><i>Exploding the Phone</i> tells this story in full for the first time. It traces the birth of long-distance communication and the telephone, the rise of AT&amp;T&#x2019;s monopoly, the creation of the sophisticated machines that made it all work, and the discovery of Ma Bell&#x2019;s Achilles&#x2019; heel. Phil Lapsley expertly weaves together the clandestine underground of phone phreaks&#x201d; who turned the network into their electronic playground, the mobsters who exploited its flaws to avoid the feds, the explosion of telephone hacking in the counterculture, and the war between the phreaks, the phone company, and the FBI.<br><br>The product of extensive original research, <i>Exploding the Phone</i> is a ground-breaking, captivating book.</p><p><b>Phil Lapsley</b> co-founded two high technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and was a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company where he advised Fortune 100 companies on strategy.

He was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. He was known as a writer, orator, poet, satirist, man of letters, and political activist. He is most notable for his Catholic faith, which had a strong impact on most of his works and his writing collaboration with G. K. Chesterton. He was President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds, but also widely regarded as a humane and sympathetic man.</p><h2>Hero Tales: A Family Treasury of True Stories From the Lives of Christian Heroes</h2><p>Presents biographies of missionaries, evangelists, and other Christian heroes who worked courageously to share the Gospel with others</p><p><b>Dave and Neta Jackson</b> are full-time writers and editors whose talented work on the TRAILBLAZER BOOKS has earned them numerous awards and worldwide acclaim. They are the parents of two adult children and make their home in Illinois."This is an excellent four-volume set to have in the home, as well as in school libraries." -- <i>Children's Literature</i></p><h2>Soldiers of Salamis</h2><p>In the final moments of the Spanish Civil War, fifty prominent Nationalist prisoners are executed by firing squad. Among them is the writer and fascist Rafael Sanchez Mazas. As the guns fire, he escapes into the forest, and can hear a search party and their dogs hunting him down. The branches move and he finds himself looking into the eyes of a militiaman, and faces death for the second time that day. But the unknown soldier simply turns and walks away. Sanchez Mazas becomes a national hero and the soldier disappears into history. As Cercas sifts the evidence to establish what happened, he realises that the true hero may not be Sanchez Mazas at all, but the soldier who chose not to shoot him. Who was he? Why did he spare him? And might he still be alive?</p><p>Javier Cercas was born in 1962. He is a novelist, short story writer and essayist, whose books include El Vientrede la ballena (The Belly of the Whale, 1997) and Relatos Reales (True Tales, 2000). He has taught at the University of Illinois and since 1989 has been a lecturer in Spanish literature at the University of Gerona.Spanish journalist and novelist Cercas strives for a "true tale" in his first book to be published in the U.S., the story of a political prisoner during the Spanish Civil War who cheated death twice in one day. Narrated by a Spanish journalist also called Javier Cercas, the novel is the chronicle of his quest to uncover a story as slippery and charmed as its protagonist, Rafael S�nchez Mazas, a founder of the fascistic Spanish Falange, who became a minister without portfolio in Franco's postwar government. Before rising to his position of power, however, S�nchez Mazas was captured by a group of Republicans and marched into the woods along with his comrades to be executed; moments after his daring flight, "an anonymous defeated soldier" spied him-but said nothing. The facts of this fascist writer's miraculous escape quickly became legend, aided in no small part by the oral and written efforts of S�nchez Mazas himself. Sixty years later, Cercas, an inadvertent archeologist digging through his nation's bloody past, unearths revelations and epiphanies that are far less wondrous than the surface gloss, but much more useful to present-day existence. His thematic conclusions are powerful and humane enough to compensate for a narrative voice that is often speculative or long-winded. This work sometimes suffers from a scarcity of scenes and dialogue, but its moral core is smart and compelling. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For nearly 30 years Sheck Exley was the leader. He set records, he developed the techniques, and he maintained the highest standards of excellence. Sheck lived a life of adventure, danger, and excitement of a degree that few people can ever dream of, or, if they do, those dreams are nightmares. If you participate on the highest level, you know that some of your best friends are going to die. If you continue to push yourself and your equipment to the limits--if you persist in being a world class diver as Sheck was--the chances are very high that you, too, will die. <p>This book may terrify you, but it will unquestionably fascinate you, and in the end, Sheck Exley will convince you that his death came to him in the midst of the incredibly intense joy he took in diving into the depths of the earth.</p></p><p>"Sheck Exley for almost thirty years developed the techniques and set the standards for cave divers today. Many times while reading this book I found myself holding my breath while someone was stuck in a tight spot, fighting with damaged or defective equipment, lost in a silted-up passage, or just plain running out of air . . . This book is as close as most will ever want to get to an underwater cave." -- <i>Paul Steward, Central Jersey Caver</i><br><br>"Sheck Exley was at the forefront of international cave diving.

True stories that give voice to the thoughts we all have but dare not mention. It begins with a Tang Instant Breakfast Drink television commercial when Augusten was seven. Then there is the contest of wills with the deranged cleaning lady. The execution of a rodent carried out with military precision and utter horror. Telemarketing revenge. Dating an undertaker and much more. A collection of true stories that are universal in their appeal yet unabashedly intimate and very funny.</p></p><p>It&#x2019;s best to know this from the start: Augusten Burroughs is mean. Augusten Burroughs is also outrageously X-rated. If you can get past those two things, Burroughs might just be the most refreshing voice in American books today, and his collection of acerbic essays will have you laughing out loud even while cringing in your seat. Whether he is stepping on the fingers of little children or giving you the blow-by-blow on a very unholy act, Burroughs manages to do it in a way that fills conflicted fans with both horror and glee. <p> Spanning from the surprisingly Machiavellian portrayal of his role in a Tang commercial at age seven to his more recent foray into dog ownership, Burroughs has what seems to be an endless supply of offbeat life experiences. Much like earlier David Sedaris collections (<i>Barrel Fever</i> or <i>Naked</i>), there are occasional fits and starts in the flow of the writing, but ultimately, Magical Thinking is worth reading (and re-reading). If you&#x2019;re familiar with Burroughs's memoirs, <i>Running with Scissors</i>, and <i>Dry</i>, you may find parts of <i>Magical Thinking</i> repetitive, since these essays bounce around in time between the other two. In fact, in an ideal world, this collection would have come first, as it offers an excellent introduction to Burroughs's fascinating life. <i>--Vicky Griffith</i></p>Praise for Augusten Burroughs<br><br>"A wrenching, edifying journey...with the added benefit of being really entertaining."<br>- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> on <i>Dry</i><br><br>"Beneath the quick-flowing, funny-sad surface of Burroughs's prose lurks considerable complexity."<br>- <i>Time</i> on <i>Dry</i><br><br>"A great read."<br>- <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> on <i>Dry</i><br><br>"<i>Dry</i> is more than a heartbreaking tale; it's a heroic one."<br>- <i>People</i> on <i>Dry</i><br><br>"Laughter on the road to sobriety...for aficionados of outrageous black comedy."<br>- <i>The New York Times</i> on <i>Dry</i><br><br>"Bawdy, outrageous...insanely funny (quite literally)...a William Burroughs situation comedy."<br>- <i>The New York Times</i> on <i>Running with Scissors</i><br><br>"Running with Scissors, as a memoir in the current conventional sense, makes a good run at blowing every other contender out of the water."<br>- <i>The Washington Post</i> on <i>Running with Scissors</i><br><br>"Outrageously amusing...wait until you get a load of this guy's material....

When Chicky Starr decides to take an old, decaying mansion set high on the cliffs overlooking the windswept Atlantic Ocean and turn it into a restful place for a holiday by the sea, everyone thinks she is crazy. Helped by Rigger (a bad boy turned good who is handy around the house) and Orla, her niece (a whiz at business), Chicky is finally ready to welcome the first guests to Stone House&#x2019;s big warm kitchen, log fires, and understated elegant bedrooms. John, the American movie star, thinks he has arrived incognito; Winnie and Lillian are forced into taking a holiday together; Nicola and Henry, husband and wife, have been shaken by seeing too much death practicing medicine; Anders hates his father&#x2019;s business, but has a real talent for music; Miss Nell Howe, a retired schoolteacher, criticizes everything and leaves a day early, much to everyone&#x2019;s relief; the Walls are disappointed to have won this second-prize holiday in a contest where first prize was Paris; and Freda, the librarian, is afraid of her own psychic visions. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Sharing a week with this unlikely cast of characters is pure joy, full of Maeve&#x2019;s trademark warmth and humor.

Come to stay in my hotel?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;ll come for a week one winter. I like the Irish countryside in winter, not when it&#x2019;s full of noise and show and people doing leprechaun duty.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Cassidy had never taken a holiday. This was groundbreaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I should go now while Queenie is alive, I suppose.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You should have it up and running as soon as possible.&#x2019; Mrs Cassidy hated to let the grass grow beneath her feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;How will I explain it all . . . to everybody?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You know, people don&#x2019;t have to explain things nearly as much as you think they do. Just say that you bought it with the money Walter left you. It&#x2019;s only the truth, after all.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;How can it be the truth?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;It&#x2019;s because of Walter you came here to New York. And because he left you, you went and earned that money and saved it. In a way, he <i>did</i> leave it to you. I don&#x2019;t see any lie there.&#x2019; And Mrs Cassidy put on the face that meant they would never speak of it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the following weeks, Chicky transferred her savings to an Irish bank. There were endless negotiations with banks and lawyers. There were planning applications to be sorted, earth movers to be contacted, hotel regulations to be consulted, tax considerations to be decided. She would never have believed how many aspects of it all there were to put in place before the announcement was made. She and Miss Queenie told nobody about their arrangement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eventually it all seemed ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t put it off much longer,&#x2019; Chicky said to Mrs Cassidy as they cleared the table after supper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;It breaks my heart, but you should go tomorrow.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Tomorrow?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Miss Queenie can&#x2019;t wait much longer, and you have to tell your family some time. Do it before it&#x2019;s leaked out to them. It will be better this way.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;But to get ready to go in one day? I mean, I have to pack and say my goodbyes . . .&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You could pack in twenty minutes. You have hardly any possessions. The men in this house aren&#x2019;t great on big flowery goodbye speeches, any more than I am myself.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m half cracked to do this, Mrs Cassidy.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No, Chicky, you&#x2019;d be half cracked if you didn&#x2019;t do it. You were always great at taking an opportunity.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Maybe I&#x2019;d have been better if I hadn&#x2019;t seized the opportunity of following Walter Starr.&#x2019; Chicky was rueful.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Oh yes? You&#x2019;d have been promoted in the knitting factory. Married a mad farmer, have six children that you&#x2019;d be trying to find jobs for. No, I think you make great judgements. You made a decision, contacted me for a job and <i>that</i> turned out all right for twenty years, didn&#x2019;t it? You did fine by coming here to New York, and now you&#x2019;re going back home to own the biggest house in the neighbourhood. I don&#x2019;t see much wrong with that career path.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I love you, Mrs Cassidy,&#x2019; Chicky said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;It&#x2019;s just as well you&#x2019;re going back to the Celtic mists and twilight if you&#x2019;re going to start talking like that,&#x2019; Mrs Cassidy said, but her face was much softer than usual.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>###</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Ryan family sat open-mouthed as she told them her plans.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chicky coming home for good? <i>Buying</i> the Sheedy place? Setting up a hotel to be open summer and winter? The main reaction was total disbelief.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only one to show pure delight in the idea was her brother Brian.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;That will soften the O&#x2019;Haras&#x2019; cough,&#x2019; he said with a broad smile. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ve been sniffing after that place for years. They want to knock it down and build six top-of-the-market homes up there.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;That was exactly what Miss Queenie didn&#x2019;t want!&#x2019; Chicky agreed.<br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;d love to be there when they find out,&#x2019; Brian said. He had never got over the fact that the O&#x2019;Haras hadn&#x2019;t thought him worthy of their daughter. She had married a man who had managed to lose a great deal of O&#x2019;Hara money on the horses, Brian often noted with satisfaction.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>###</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mother couldn&#x2019;t believe that Chicky was going to move in with Miss Queenie the very next day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;ll need to be on the premises,&#x2019; Chicky explained. &#x2018;And anyway, it&#x2019;s no harm to have someone there to hand Miss Queenie a cup of tea every now and then.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;And a bowl of porridge or packet of biscuits wouldn&#x2019;t go amiss either,&#x2019; Kathleen said. &#x2018;Mikey saw her picking blackberries a while ago. She said they were free.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Are you <i>sure</i> you own the place, Chicky?&#x2019; Her father was worried, as always. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not just going in there as a maid, like Nuala was, but with a promise that she will leave it to you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp; <br> Chicky patted them down, assured them it was hers. &nbsp; Little by little they began to realise that it was actually going to happen. Every objection they brought up she had already thought of. They were worried about the economy and no one would be taking holidays. Her years in New York had made her into a businesswoman. She knew if she kept it simple, it would be just what people would want to get away for a rest. They had learned from the past not to underestimate Chicky. They would not make the same mistake a second time. &nbsp;<br><br>Her family had arranged for yet another Mass to be said for Walter, as Chicky hadn&#x2019;t been at home for the first one they said. Chicky sat in the little church in Stoneybridge and wondered if there really was a God up there watching and listening.<br> &nbsp;<br> It didn&#x2019;t seem very likely.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then everyone here appeared to think it was the case. The whole community joined in prayers for the repose of Walter Starr&#x2019;s soul. Would he have laughed if he could have known this was happening? Would he have been shocked by the superstition of these people in an Irish seaside town where he had once had a holiday romance?<br> &nbsp;<br> Now she was back here, Chicky knew that she would have to be part of the church again. It would be easier; Mrs Cassidy had gone to Mass every Sunday morning in New York. It was yet one more thing that they had never discussed.<br> &nbsp;<br> She looked around the church where she was baptised, made her First Communion and her Confirmation, the church where her sisters had been married and where people were praying for the repose of the soul of a man who had never died. It was all very odd.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still she hoped that the prayers would do someone somewhere some good.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>###</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were a series of minefields that had to be walked very carefully. Chicky must make sure not to annoy those who already ran bed-and-breakfast accommodation around the place, or who rented out summer cottages. She began a ceaseless diplomatic offensive explaining that what she was doing was creating something totally new for the area, not a premises that would take business away from them.<br> &nbsp;<br> She visited the many public houses dotted around the countryside and told them of her plans. Her guests would want to tour the cliffs and hills around Stoneybridge. She would recommend that they see the real Ireland, take their lunch in all the traditional bars, pubs and inns around. So if they were to serve soup and simple food, she would love to know about it and she would send customers in their direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> She chose builders from another part of the country, as she wanted to avoid giving preference to the O&#x2019;Haras or their main rivals in the construction business. It was so much easier than choosing one over the other. It was the same about buying supplies. Offence could easily be taken if she was seen to favour just one place. Chicky made sure that everyone would get something from the project. <br> &nbsp; <br> The main thing was to get the architects in and out and the workmen on site. &nbsp;<br> She would need a manager, but not yet. She would want someone to live in and help her with the cooking but again, that could wait.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chicky had her eye on her niece Orla for this job. The girl was quick and bright. She loved Stoneybridge and the life it offered. She was energetic and sporty, into windsurfing and rock climbing. She had done a computer course in Dublin and a diploma in marketing. Chicky could teach her to cook. She was lively and good with people. She would be a natural for Stone House. Irritatingly, the girl seemed to want to stay in London where she had a job. No explanations, she just went. Things were so much easier for the young these days than in her time, Chicky thought. Orla didn&#x2019;t have to ask permission or family approval. It was assumed that she was an adult and they had no say in her life.<br> &nbsp;<br> The plans went on and on. There would be eight bedrooms for guests and one big kitchen and dining area where all the guests would eat dinner together. She found a huge old-fashioned table that would have to be scrubbed every day but it was authentic. This was no place for fancy mahogany and place mats or thick Irish linen tablecloths. It must be the real thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> She got one local craftsman to make her fourteen chairs, and another to restore an old dresser to display the china. With Miss Queenie she drove to auctions and sales around the countryside and found the right glasses, plates, bowls.<br> &nbsp;<br> They met people who would be able to restore some of the old rugs in the Sheedy home, and who could replace frayed leather on little antique tables.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was the part that Miss Queenie loved most. She would say over and over what a miracle it was to have all these lovely treasures restored. Her sisters would be so pleased when they saw what was happening. Miss Queenie believed that they knew every detail of what was going on in Stone House, and watched it all approvingly. It was touching that she saw them settled in some happy place waiting for the hotel to open and checking the comings and goings in Stoneybridge. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was rather more unsettling when Miss Queenie also assumed that Walter Starr would be there in heaven with the two Miss Sheedys, cheering on every development that was being made by his brave, courageous widow.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chicky made sure to tell her family about her plans each week so that they could be well briefed and ahead of the game. It gave them great status to know in advance that the planning applications had been approved, a walled kitchen garden to grow their own vegetables planned and oil-fired central heating for the whole house.<br> &nbsp;<br> She would probably need a professional designer as well. Even though she and Miss Queenie thought they knew what the place should look like, they <i>were</i> pitching for discerning people, they would charge real money and must make the place right. What Chicky thought of as elegant might well be considered tacky.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though she had looked at all the hotels and country houses in magazines, she had little practical experience in getting the right look. Mrs Cassidy&#x2019;s Select Accommodation hadn&#x2019;t been a real training ground for style.<br> &nbsp;<br> There would be a lot of work ahead: she would have to have a website and take bookings online, still a very foreign world to her. This is where young Orla would be her right hand if she were to come back from London. She had telephoned her twice but the girl had been distracted and non-committal. Chicky&#x2019;s sister Kathleen said that Orla was like a bag of cats and that there was no talking to her on any subject.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;She&#x2019;s more headstrong than you ever were,&#x2019; Kathleen said ruefully, &#x2018;and that&#x2019;s really saying something.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Look at how well and sane I turned out in the end,&#x2019; Chicky laughed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;The place isn&#x2019;t up and running yet.&#x2019; Kathleen&#x2019;s voice was full of doom. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll see how well and sane you are when you&#x2019;re open for business.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Only Mrs Cassidy, over in New York, and Miss Queenie believed it would happen and be a big success. Everyone else was humouring her and hoping it would take off but in the same way that they hoped for a long hot summer and for the Irish soccer team to do well in the World Cup.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes Chicky would go and walk the cliffs at night and look out over the Atlantic Ocean. Always it gave her strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> People had enough courage to get into small, shaky boats and set sail over those choppy waters, not knowing what lay ahead. Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be too hard to set up a guest house? Then she would go back indoors where Miss Queenie would make them a mug of hot chocolate and say that she hadn&#x2019;t been so happy since she was a girl, since the days when she and her sisters would go to a hunt ball and hope they might find dashing young men to marry. That had never happened, but this time it would work. Stone House was going to happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Chicky would pat her on the hand and say that they would be the talk of the country. And as she said it, she believed it. All her worries would go. Whether it was because of the walk in the wild winds or the comforting hot chocolate or Miss Queenie&#x2019;s hopeful face or a combination of all three, it meant she slept a long, untroubled sleep every night.<br> &nbsp;<br> She would wake ready for anything, which was just as well because in the months ahead there was quite a lot she had to be ready for.<br></p></p><h2>What Drives Winning: Building Character Gets Results.

Now they must empty and sell the beloved&nbsp; family home, which hasn&#x2019;t been de-cluttered in more than half a century. Twenty-three&nbsp; rooms bulge with history, antiques, and oxygen tanks. Plum remembers her loving&nbsp; but difficult parents who could not have been more different: the British father, a&nbsp; handsome, disciplined patriarch who nonetheless could not control his opinionated,&nbsp; extroverted Southern-belle wife who loved tennis and gin gimlets. The task consumes&nbsp; her, becoming more rewarding than she ever imagined. Items from childhood trigger&nbsp; memories of her eccentric family growing up in a small town on the shores of Lake&nbsp; Ontario in the 1950s and 60s. But unearthing new facts about her parents helps her&nbsp; reconcile those relationships with a more accepting perspective about who they were&nbsp; and what they valued.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><i> They Left Us Everything </i> is a funny, touching memoir about the importance of preserving&nbsp; family history to make sense of the past and nurturing family bonds to safeguard the&nbsp; future.</p></p><p><b> Plum Johnson </b> is an award-winning author, artist and entrepreneur living in Toronto.

In exchange for sanctuary in the huge stone fortresses, the people tithed to their Lord Holders, who in turn supported the Weyrs, whose dragons were Pern's greatest weapon against Thread.<br><br>But not everyone on Pern was part of that system of mutual care and protection, particularly those who had been rendered holdless as punishment for wrongdoing. And there were some, like Jayge's trader clan, who simply preferred the freedom of the roads to the security of a hold. Others, like Aramina's family, had lost their holds through injustice and cruelty. For all the holdless, life was a constant struggle for survival.<br><br>Then, from the ranks of the criminals and the disaffected, rose a band of renegades, led by the Lady Thella. No one was safe from Thella's depredations, and now her quarry was Aramina, reputed to have a telepathic link with dragons. But when Thella mistakenly vented her rage on Jayge's family, she made a dangerous mistake. For Jayge was bent on revenge . . . and he would never let her have the girl who heard dragons!</p><p>There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail.

If Tobia aspires to the ranks of comic memoirists like David Sedaris and Mindy Kaling, <i>Sissy</i> succeeds." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>A heart-wrenching, eye-opening, and giggle-inducing memoir about what it's like to grow up not sure if you're (a) a boy, (b) a girl, (c) something in between, or (d) all of the above.<br><br>"A beautiful book . . . honest and funny."--Trevor Noah, <i>The Daily Show</i><br>"<i>Sensational</i>."--Tyler Oakley<br>"Jacob Tobia is a force." --<i>Good Morning America</i><br>"A trans Nora Ephron . . . both honest and didactic." --<i>OUT Magazine</i><br>"A rallying cry for anyone who's ever felt like they don't belong." --<i>Woman's Day</i></b><br><br>As a young child in North Carolina, Jacob Tobia wasn't the wrong gender, they just had too much of the stuff. Barbies? Yes. Playing with bugs? Absolutely. Getting muddy? Please. Princess dresses? You betcha. Jacob wanted it all, but because they were "a boy," they were told they could only have the masculine half. Acting feminine labelled them "a sissy" and brought social isolation. <br><br>It took Jacob years to discover that being "a sissy" isn't something to be ashamed of. It's a source of pride. Following Jacob through bullying and beauty contests, from Duke University to the United Nations to the podiums of the Methodist church--not to mention the parlors of the White House--this unforgettable memoir contains multitudes. A deeply personal story of trauma and healing, a powerful reflection on gender and self-acceptance, and a hilarious guidebook for wearing tacky clip-on earrings in today's world, <i>Sissy </i>guarantees you'll never think about gender--both other people's and your own--the same way again.</p><p><b>Jacob Tobia </b>(pronouns: they/them) is a gender nonconforming writer, producer, and performer based in Los Angeles.

It is in Tobia&#x2019;s often self-deprecating humor that <i>Sissy </i>is most transformative, and where it most departs from other trans memoirs.

It's Me, Margaret</i> and <i>Forever</i>, in which she tackles the cultural hot button of teenage sexuality. In <i>Summer Sisters</i>, her third novel for adults, the author again explores the ramifications of love--and lust--on two friends. Initially, the differences between Caitlin Somers and Victoria Leonard (or "Vix," as Caitlin christens her) draw them together: privileged Caitlin is wild and outspoken, beautiful but emotionally fragile, while working-class Vix is shy, reserved, and plain in comparison. After Caitlin selects Vix to accompany her to her father's home in Martha's Vineyard for the summer, the two become inextricably connected as "summer sisters." <p> On the Vineyard, Vix and Caitlin first find love, then sex--and lots of it. Yet Blume soon moves beyond hot fun in the summer sun, tracing the romantic and familial travails of the two from pre-adolescence to adulthood. Solid Vix evolves into Victoria, an equally solid, Harvard-educated, Manhattan public-relations exec. Unpredictable Caitlin opts out of college and travels to Europe, where she has a string of short-lived affairs with a series of intriguing (in every sense of the word) foreigners. It is only after she returns to the Vineyard that Caitlin does the unthinkable, forever changing both her friendship with Vix and their lives. Blume once again proves herself a master of the female psyche, and <i>Summer Sisters</i> is likely to entertain both her postadolescent and more mature readers.</p>The <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!<br><br>&#x201c;Compulsively readable ... her powers are prodigious.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;As warm as a summer breeze blowing through your hair, as nostalgic as James Taylor singing &#x2018;How Sweet It Is.&#x2019; You remember.

Must it be a unique, saleable luxury item? Can it be a concept that never takes material form? Or an idea for a work that can be repeated endlessly? Conceptual art favours an engagement with such questions. As the variety of illustrations in this book shows, it can take many forms: photographs, videos, posters, billboards, charts, plans and, especially, language itself. Tony Godfrey has written a clear, lively and informative account of this fascinating phenomenon. He traces the origins of Conceptual art to Marcel Duchamp and the anti-art gestures of Dada, and then establishes links to those artists who emerged in the 1960s and early 1970s, whose work forms the heart of this study: Joseph Kosuth, Lawrence Weiner, Victor Burgin, Marcel Broodthaers and many others.</p><p>Tony Godfrey is Programme Director of the MA in Contemporary Art at Sotheby&#39;s Institute, London. His books include New Image Painting in the 1980s and Drawing Today."Tony Godfrey's book is the intelligent, well argued, comprehensive and beautifully presented survey of Conceptual art we have been waiting on for years. It is both accessible and easily readable while at the same time conceding little intellectual high ground. This is an exquisitely designed paperback which both looks and feels the business. Buy it, steal it, or get your local library to buy it. This is that rare thing - an indispensable classic that is a must for anyone interested in understanding the roots of contemporary art."-Contemporary Visual Arts "Authoritative."-Christie's Books "More than just a compilation of sources, documents, and images... Osborne offers an original, challenging, reinterpretation of Conceptual Art... A solid contribution to the burgeoning re-examination of Conceptual Art."-Barry Schwabsky, BookForum On the Art &amp; Ideas series "Art &amp; Ideas has broken new ground in making accessible authoritative views on periods, movements and concepts in art. As a series it represents a real advance in publishing."-Sir Nicholas Serota, Director, Tate London "The format is wonderful and offers what had long been missing in academic studies: usable manuals for specific themes or periods... I am definitely not alone in welcoming Art &amp; Ideas as a precious set of teaching tools."-Joachim Pissarro, Yale University "Phaidon's series may prove to be the pick of the crop. It boasts expert but undogmatic texts and a wealth of illustrations."-The Sunday Telegraph</p><h2>Becoming Dickens: The Invention of a Novelist</h2><p><p><i>Becoming Dickens</i> tells the story of how an ambitious young Londoner became England's greatest novelist. In following the twists and turns of Charles Dickens's early career, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst examines a remarkable double transformation: in reinventing himself Dickens reinvented the form of the novel. It was a high-stakes gamble, and Dickens never forgot how differently things could have turned out. Like the hero of<i> Dombey and Son</i>, he remained haunted by "what might have been, and what was not."</p><p><br></p><p><br>In his own lifetime, Dickens was without rivals. He styled himself simply "The Inimitable." But he was not always confident about his standing in the world. From his traumatized childhood to the suicide of his first collaborator and the sudden death of the woman who had a good claim to being the love of his life, Dickens faced powerful obstacles. Before settling on the profession of novelist, he tried his hand at the law and journalism, considered a career in acting, and even contemplated emigrating to the West Indies. Yet with <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and a groundbreaking series of plays, sketches, and articles, he succeeded in turning every potential breakdown into a breakthrough.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Douglas-Fairhurst's provocative new biography, focused on the 1830s, portrays a restless and uncertain Dickens who could not decide on the career path he should take and would never feel secure in his considerable achievements.</p></p><p>Robert Douglas-Fairhurst is Professor of English Literature and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.Douglas-Fairhurst offers an original perspective on Dickens's early life and writing as Dickens works through the choices before him in pursuit of a voice and style he could confidently claim as his own.... a fresh and insightful study, moving and exceptionally well-written... a book to be valued by a range of readers, and one certain to stand the test of time. (David Paroissien, University of Massachusetts, Amherst)<br><br>Rightly rejecting familiar accounts of Dickens's life, Douglas-Fairhurst's biography shows us the forlorn and driven young Dickens, restless and uncertain, who could not yet choose what was to become his inevitable mode of composing fiction.

What happened? Why did the two great philosophers behave as they did? What did Popper have against Wittgenstein? At stake was the meaning and direction of the analytic revolution--which had been led by Bertrand Russell --and, ultimately, the purpose of philosophy itself. <p> Edmonds and Eidinow's treatment is a very clever and interesting way to introduce the history of philosophy in the first third of the 20th century. The 10 minute argument provides an effective and fascinating organising focus for the whole book--not only because one is curious to find out who said what and why--but because to understand what really happened involves finding out what kind of men these great philosophers were, and how they stood to the philosophic tradition. Popper's opposition to Wittgenstein however, was more than just a difference in philosophic views; on a deeper level Wittgenstein represented the Vienna that had been out of reach even to the son of a respected and socially responsible lawyer: "In Wittgenstein he saw the imperial city where riches and status commanded respect and opened doors, the separate territory where inflation-wrought poverty had no place and the Nazis could be bought off."</p><p> It is the social and political background of the story, the class differences, as well as the philosophic differences between the two great philosophers which makes this book so unusual and interesting. Part biography, part social history, part history of philosophy <i>Wittgenstein's Poker</i> is informative, entertaining and accessible. --<i>Larry Brown</i></p>&#39;Those 10 minutes shook the world of Western philosophy literally to its foundations...

Many of the images are striking, particularly the white-on-black night scenes describing Queen Mab's dream appearance and Juliet's decision to drink poison. Well-drawn characters such as the brash young men, the Nurse, and Friar Lawrence come to life in these panels. This is especially true for Juliet, whose early images of youthful innocence contrast sharply with her distraught face as the story progresses. With the exception of Capulet and Montague, who look more like grandfathers than fathers to such young teens, visual characterizations are accurate. Text for this version comes from an abridgment of the modern English translation found in <i>No Fear Shakespeare</i> (Spark, 2007). Readers will not encounter any of Shakespeare's language or poetry in this adaptation. Even familiar speeches such as O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? are modernized to Oh Romeo, Romeo, why must you be Romeo? A limited number of footnotes explain references to unfamiliar phrases, particularly bawdy humor. Readers interested in graphic-novel versions with excerpts from Shakespeare's original play should try <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (Barron's, 2005), edited by Philip Page and Marilyn Petit, or Richard Appignanesi's adaptation (Abrams, 2007).<i>&#x2013;Barbara M.

The blithe, boisterous son of the last great Puritan minister, he seemed destined to be overshadowed by his brilliant siblings&#x2014;especially his sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, who penned the century&#x2019;s bestselling book <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>. But when pushed into the ministry, the charismatic Beecher found international fame by shedding his father&#x2019;s Old Testament&#x2013;style fire-and-brimstone theology and instead preaching a New Testament&#x2013;based gospel of unconditional love and healing, becoming one of the founding fathers of modern American Christianity. By the 1850s, his spectacular sermons at Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights had made him New York&#x2019;s number one tourist attraction, so wildly popular that the ferries from Manhattan to Brooklyn were dubbed &#x201c;Beecher Boats.&#x201d; <br>Beecher inserted himself into nearly every important drama of the era&#x2014;among them the antislavery and women&#x2019;s suffrage movements, the rise of the entertainment industry and tabloid press, and controversies ranging from Darwinian evolution to presidential politics. He was notorious for his irreverent humor and melodramatic gestures, such as auctioning slaves to freedom in his pulpit and shipping rifles&#x2014;nicknamed &#x201c;Beecher&#x2019;s Bibles&#x201d;&#x2014;to the antislavery resistance fighters in Kansas. Thinkers such as Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, and Twain befriended&#x2014;and sometimes parodied&#x2014;him.<br>And then it all fell apart. In 1872 Beecher was accused by feminist firebrand Victoria Woodhull of adultery with one of his most pious parishioners. Suddenly the &#x201c;Gospel of Love&#x201d; seemed to rationalize a life of lust. The cuckolded husband brought charges of &#x201c;criminal conversation&#x201d; in a salacious trial that became the most widely covered event of the century, garnering more newspaper headlines than the entire Civil War. Beecher survived, but his reputation and his causes&#x2014;from women&#x2019;s rights to progressive evangelicalism&#x2014;suffered devastating setbacks that echo to this day.<br>Featuring the page-turning suspense of a novel and dramatic new historical evidence, Debby Applegate has written the definitive biography of this captivating, mercurial, and sometimes infuriating figure. In our own time, when religion and politics are again colliding and adultery in high places still commands headlines, Beecher&#x2019;s story sheds new light on the culture and conflicts of contemporary America.</p><p>DEBBY APPLEGATE is a graduate summa cum laude of Amherst College and was a Sterling Fellow at Yale University, where she received her Ph.D. in American Studies. She has written for publications ranging from the <i>Journal of American History</i> to <i>The New York Times</i>, and has taught at Yale and Wesleyan Universities.<b>Chapter 1 <br>&#x201c;Damned If You Do, and Damned If You Don&#x2019;t&#x201d; <br></b><br>One evening in late December, sometime around 1820, Henry Ward Beecher trudged through the snow, returning home from running an errand for his parents. Exactly how old he was he couldn&#x2019;t say, but he was still a chubby little boy, with wide gray eyes set above apple red cheeks. As he passed up the long town common in the center of the village, he was surprised to see Litchfield&#x2019;s little brown Episcopalian church lit up like a beacon in the early darkness. <br><br>Henry was far too young to follow the fine theological distinctions his father used to separate the good Protestants from the bad Protestants, but of this he was sure: The Episcopalians were on the bad side. He needed no other proof than the fact that they didn&#x2019;t attend the white-steepled church where his father, the Reverend Lyman Beecher, preached every Sunday. In truth, God and Lyman Beecher were so intertwined in the little boy&#x2019;s mind that he did not quite grasp that Episcopalianism was a rival religion, he later recalled, &#x201c;for I supposed there was no other religion except that which my father looked after.&#x201d; <br><br>Henry was irresistibly drawn to the open door of the church, and as he peered in he was shocked to find candles blazing at every window; boughs of spruce, pine, and arborvitae twined around the pews; and a choir singing blissfully about the birth of Christ. He had never seen such a spectacle, certainly not in his father&#x2019;s austere meetinghouse, and he could not imagine what it meant. <br><br>Although he did not know it then, this dazzling vision would be Henry&#x2019;s only taste of Christmas as a child. Christmas &#x201c;was not known in the house of my father, for he was a Puritan of the Puritans,&#x201d; Henry said years later. &#x201c;I never heard of Santa Claus when I was a boy. I never hung up a stocking. I feel bad about it to this day.&#x201d;(1)<br> <br>When Henry was a boy, his faith in his father was so deeply ingrained that it never occurred to him to ask why they did not celebrate Christmas. If he had, Lyman&#x2019;s answer would have been unequivocal. As an orthodox Calvinist, Lyman Beecher interpreted the Bible literally, as solid fact, and there was nothing in the Scriptures to suggest that Christ was born on December 25. And even if there were, the day would be an occasion for solemn prayer, not sensual frivolity. Why, the Beechers didn&#x2019;t even celebrate their own birthdays. <br><br>If the Episcopalians chose to delude themselves about Christ&#x2019;s birth that was one thing, as far as Lyman was concerned, but this business of filling the church with decadent appeals to the senses&#x2013;with music, gaudy decorations, and gifts&#x2013;was a sneaky attempt to lure the good Christians of Connecticut from the true faith of the Puritan fathers. Lyman had no patience for newfangled notions of religious tolerance or the separation of church and state. Episcopalians, Unitarians, Catho-lics&#x2013;Lyman lumped them together with atheists, drunkards, thieves, and Jeffersonian Democrats, declaring each one a force of deviltry to be fought tooth and nail. <br>Despite his harsh dogma, Henry&#x2019;s father was not a cruel man. Those who knew the famous Reverend Beecher only by rumor or from reading his sensational fire-and-brimstone sermons were often surprised to fi nd that in person he was warm and witty, fiercely intelligent, and deeply compassionate. When he invoked the terrors of the devil and the terrible judgment of God&#x2019;s law, it was not out of perversity but because he was truly heartbroken that, as he saw it, so many &#x201c;immortal souls are sleeping on the brink of hell.&#x201d;(2)<br> <br>Lyman&#x2019;s devotion to God was rivaled only by his devotion to his children, and like any good parent, he wanted them to be happy. But in this age before modern medicine, when many families in New England lost at least one child to the grave, he was tortured by the fear that his children would be suddenly swept away by death before he could bring them to God. If they felt deprived by missing such pleasures as Christmas, Lyman was more than willing to trade their happiness on earth to secure their eternal happiness in heaven. <br><br>That cold Christmas Eve, Henry&#x2019;s small heart swelled with conflicting emotions as he &#x201c;stood wistful, and with a vague curiosity, looking in, and wondering what sort of folks these Episcopal Church people were.&#x201d; He would have liked nothing better than to be in the middle of such gaiety and excitement. Yet even at this young age, he found it impossible to shake his father&#x2019;s teachings. He turned away from the church and headed home, with a &#x201c;feeling of mixed wonder and pity&#x201d; for those people who dwelled so far outside his father&#x2019;s sphere.(3)<br> <br>This complex constellation of feelings colored every corner of Henry&#x2019;s childhood. He idolized his father and yearned desperately for Lyman&#x2019;s love and approval, yet every natural impulse in him craved forbidden pleasures. He longed to be like his older brothers and sisters, who seemed so easily to meet the high standards of Lyman and his fearsome God. But no matter how afraid he was of hell and how hard he tried to get into heaven, his desire for earthly happiness kept getting in the way. <br><br>Twenty-five years would pass before Henry would begin to question seriously his father&#x2019;s opinion on this or any other matter. When he did, however, he quickly made up for lost time, tossing out his father&#x2019;s beliefs by the bushel. By then Henry was becoming a wealthy, worldly man who shamelessly indulged his newly acquired tastes for European travel, velvet jackets, sumptuous rugs, and expensive art, spending enormous sums of money on gifts for his family and friends. Before long he would even give up his belief in hell itself. <br><br>But even when he succumbed to the Victorian craze for Christmas, celebrating it at home and in his church with all the merry trimmings, the holiday never really took hold in him. What he had yearned for all those years ago was not toys or Santa Claus, he recalled in old age&#x2013;&#x201c;<i>A little love was what I wanted</i>[.]&#x201d;4 <br><br>Lyman Beecher had good reason to fear for his son&#x2019;s soul. Henry Ward Beecher was born in the summer of 1813, in the midst of one of the most terrifying, tumultuous periods in American history. From the distance of two centuries, we have mythologized the decades after the War for Independence as an Arcadian idyll of happy farmers and wise founding fathers. But the American Revolution was a genuine, bloody revolution, and, like all revolutions, it left a long wake of social, economic, and political upheaval. The future of the young Republic was still very much up in the air in 1813, creating an atmosphere of tremendous exhilaration and profound anxiety&#x2013;a potent combination that would shape the emotional core of Henry Ward Beecher and his generation. <br><br>Relations between the United States and England had remained strained and murky since the end of the war, growing even more complex as the French Revolution of 1789 and then the invasion of Europe by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2019;s armies tore up old diplomatic alliances. Tensions peaked when England attempted to cut off sea trade between the United States and the Continent by attacking American ships and impressing almost a thousand American sailors, in essence kidnapping them and forcing them to work on British ships. Finally, in the summer of 1812, President James Madison declared war on the United Kingdom&#x2013;the War of 1812 or the Second American Revolution, as it came to be known.<br> <br>Eager to retake their former colony, the British invaded from all sides, from the Great Lakes in the north to the Gulf of New Orleans in the South. In the spring of 1813 eight British warships sailed into the waters of the Connecticut Sound, blockading the ports, burning wharves and trading ships, and forcing the city of New London to evacuate when the fleet tried to sail up the Connecticut River. By the summer of Henry&#x2019;s first birthday, the Redcoats were marching into Washington, D.C., where they burned the Capitol to the ground and pushed the Republic to the edge of bankruptcy. <br><br>If any state should have stood firm in the midst of this chaos, it ought to have been Connecticut, the Land of Steady Habits, where clocks, granite, and schoolteachers were its chief exports, and the specter of Puritanism still stalked every crevice of its rocky hills. Long after the new federal constitution of 1788 guaranteed the separation of church and state at the national level, Connecticut proudly remained a theocracy, in which every household was taxed for support of the state-sanctioned Congregationalist Church. For more than two hundred years the same aristocratic network of merchants and ministers&#x2013;&#x201c;the Standing Order,&#x201d; as it was known&#x2013;controlled both politics and society. Federalist in their politics and Calvinist in their religion, the Standing Order considered themselves the last bulwark against the &#x201c;forces of innovation and democracy,&#x201d; which had led the country once again to bloodshed. So great was their animosity toward &#x201c;Mr. Madison&#x2019;s war&#x201d; that Connecticut seriously considered seceding from the Union&#x2013;an idea that the citizens of the South would revive forty years later. <br><br>But with the state&#x2019;s stony, overfarmed soil, burgeoning birthrate, and dependence on European trade, no place was hit harder than Connecticut by the anxiety and turmoil of the post- Revolutionary period. So many young people were fleeing the state for the rich bottomland of the Ohio frontier that the region was designated the &#x201c;Western Reserve of Connecticut.&#x201d; A dangerous discontent was rising among those who remained at home. Out-of-wedlock births were skyrocketing, and drunkenness was a genuine epidemic, with the average citizen now drinking up to five gallons of cheap hard liquor a year. To top it off, a coalition of Jeffersonian Democrats, attorneys, atheists, workingmen, and &#x201c;unofficial&#x201d; religious sects was starting to agitate for an end to the old Standing Order. To many folks it seemed as if Lucifer was loose upon the land. <br><br>But Connecticut Yankees were a wily, peculiar breed, according to early American folklore, with a slippery shrewdness that could confound even Satan himself. They were filled with contradictions&#x2013;in turn slyly funny and profoundly grave, aggressively innovative and doggedly conservative, &#x201c;a rare combination of philosopher and fi ghter,&#x201d; as Frederick Law Olmsted once remarked.(5) At the same time, they were absolutely, infuriatingly, convinced of their own superiority, and obsessed with converting the world to their way of thinking. In a contest of wit and will, the devil and the Connecticut Yankee were considered nearly an even match. If there was any truth in this stereotype, it was sure to be found in Litchfield, Connecticut, and in the Beecher clan. <br><br>Perched high up in the Berkshire hills, the village of Litchfield gloried in its paradoxical reputation as a bastion of both progressive intellectual culture and staunch religious orthodoxy&#x2013;&#x201c;half Hebrew theocracy, half ultra- democratic republic,&#x201d; as Lyman&#x2019;s daughter Harriet described it.(6) It possessed two claims to national fame: its outspoken minister, the Reverend Lyman Beecher, and its pioneering schools, Miss Sarah Pierce&#x2019;s Litchfi eld Female Academy, one of the nation&#x2019;s fi rst serious schools for girls, and Judge Tapping Reeve&#x2019;s Litchfield Law School, the country&#x2019;s first school devoted solely to the study of the law. Together the two institutions attracted students from as far away as Ohio, South Carolina, Canada, and the West Indies, graduating scores of future congressmen, ambassadors, cabinet secretaries, and political wives, who extended the town&#x2019;s reputation to London and Paris. <br><br>In June 1813 Litchfield looked much as it does today, laid out along four broad tree- lined streets that crossed to form a long, grassy town common. In its habits, however, it was more akin to an English colony than to contemporary America. Indeed, Litchfield clung more tightly to the old ways than most New England towns. Villagers still rose with the sun and shut their houses up tight with the tolling of the nine o&#x2019;clock bell. Many of the clothes were still homespun and homemade, and children went barefoot all days but Sunday. The older &#x201c;respectable&#x201d; men of the town still strolled the streets in outdated colonial garb, clad in short breeches buckled at the knee, tricornered hats, cutaway coats, and the occasional powdered wig. Only Democrats and infidels, it was said, wore pantaloons, or trousers as they came to be called. With deliberate symbolism the Congregational meetinghouse stood in the dead center of the common at the very summit of a hill, and from its old- fashioned swallow&#x2019;s-nest pulpit the Reverend Beecher ruled over the manners and morals of the town. <br><br>Most folks here took religion seriously. From hardscrabble farmers to the town gentry, they lingered at Buell&#x2019;s general store or on the steps of the courthouse, debating Parson Beecher&#x2019;s Sunday sermon, or whether it was God&#x2019;s will to install a woodstove to warm the meetinghouse in winter. Surely, some argued (out of piety or stinginess it was hard to say), such an indulgence would send them down a slippery slope to decadence. After years of fruitless debate seven progressive young men finally purchased a stove on their own and, after more wrangling, were allowed to install it on a trial basis. It made its debut on an unusually warm November day. As they entered the meetinghouse, the townspeople stared suspiciously at the contraption, sitting smack dab in the broad middle aisle. <br><br>Old Deacon Trowbridge, a firm opponent of the stove, scornfully gathered up the tails of his long coat as he passed it, as if the devil himself would send out a spark to singe it. Uncle Noah Stone, a wealthy farmer, scowled and muttered about the uncomfortable heat. Mr. Bounce, editor of the village paper and a stove advocate, warmed his hands over the stove with a satisfied air, tucking the skirts of his coat safely between his knees. <br><br>The climax of the conflict came during the sermon, when the Reverend Beecher began warning of hell&#x2019;s &#x201c;heaping coals of fire.&#x201d; Pious Mrs. Peck, wife of an antistove deacon, felt so overcome by the unfamiliar heat that she fainted dead away. Mrs. Peck quickly recovered her wits, if not her dignity, when the young men, barely containing their laughter, informed the congregation that because the day was so warm they had not lit a fi re. The stove stayed, a small victory for progress. <br><br>The Reverend Lyman Beecher was an eccentric, contradictory character, the spitting image of the canny Connecticut Yankee. At Sunday services strangers to his church were often startled to see a short, wiry man clad in a shabby black tailcoat, his shoulder- length gray hair tied in a simple ponytail, bound down the aisle of the sanctuary, toss his dusty hat on a chair, and leap up the steps of the pulpit. With his tattered clothes, brusque manners, and thick country accent he was often mistaken for an uneducated farmer, but when he spoke listeners quailed before his aggressive arguments and maddening self- assurance.</p><h2>The Transmigration of Bodies</h2><p>A plague has brought death to the city. Two feuding crime families with blood on their hands need our hard-boiled hero, The Redeemer, to broker peace.

This is a harsh novel, as are those from a borderland besieged by extreme violence, but it&#x2019;s also oddly comforting, in large part due to its exceptional literary quality.&#x201d; <b><i>El Pa�s</i></b><br><br> Yuri Herrera's novels are like little lights in a vast darkness.

Herrera's ability to express everything in so few words, his skill of merging the argot of the streets with the poetry of life is unrivalled. The world his characters inhabit is dangerous and urban, like a postcard sent from the ends of the earth. Reading his compact novels is both exhilarating and unforgettable.&#x201d; <b>Mark Haber, Brazos Bookstore, Houston, TX</b><br><br> A fabulous book full of low-life characters struggling to get by.

Indispensable.&#x201d; <b>Matthew Geden, Waterstones Cork, Ireland</b><br><br> Reading <i>The Transmigration of Bodies</i> was akin to being enveloped in a dream state, yet one that upon waking somehow makes profound sense. Another truly magnificent novel from one of the most exciting authors to emerge on the world stage for aeons.&#x201d; <b>Ray Mattinson, Blackwell&#x2019;s, Oxford</b><br><br> A microcosmic look at the lives of two families straight out of a Shakespearean drama.

It takes an extraordinary amount of skill to combine elements of noir, political commentary, hardboiled crime, and allegory (not to mention Shakespeare, with a seasoning of existential ennui) and keep the novel moving, or in this case, racing along.

Illuminating her early childhood and wartime experiences, the book also offers a fresh perspective on her role in the infamous Babalon Working magick rituals, that were conducted by her husband, the maverick rocket scientist and Aleister Crowley disciple Jack Parsons, and the future founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Following Parsons death in 1952 from a chemical explosion, Cameron inherited her husband&#39;s magickal mantle and embarked on a lifelong spiritual quest, a journey reflected in the otherworldly images she depicted, many of them drawn from the Elemental Kingdom and astral plane. As well as her artistry, the biography also takes an in-depth look at Cameron&#39;s film appearances, and features reminiscences from the many artists, poets and movie star friends she inspired along the way. With so much of her life and work shrouded in mystery, Wormwood Star sheds new light on this most remarkable artist and elusive occult icon.</p><p>Revised edition includes fascinating new insights and information, as well as 20 new images."I was left very impressed with Spencer Kansa's treatment of Cameron. To have gone to all the effort to provide the public with a compassionate yet balanced portrayal of such a complicated figure. By keeping his head out of la-la land and grounded in facts, he provides the necessary perspective for the reader to make Cameron's legendary status undeniable and understandable. This story really did need to be told once and for all, so hats off to him for doing it."&nbsp;Zeena Schreck, co-author of Demons of the Flesh: The Complete Guide to Left Hand Path Sex Magic.<br><br>"Spencer Kansa brings to life the countless cabals and social occasionswhich Cameron enjoyed to the hilt. He might as well have been therewhen it all happened too, so authoritative is his knowledge and feel forthe sometimes penniless world of the practicing magician."Joe Ambrose, Outside Left.com<br><br>"Wormwood Star describes a magickal woman and artist, not as a tragedyas is all too tritely easy to do to those who have been allotted the role ofa magickal partner, but as a true Babalon. A woman and creative beingin her own right who, rather than change to the dictates of oppressivesociety, became a defining part of a changing one. Fabulous!"Charlotte Rodgers, author of The Bloody Sacrifice.<br><br>"Wormwood Star is a superb effort on every level, incorporating impeccableresearch and very well observed viewpoints with a flair for explainingabstruse concepts and ideas in a concise and succinct way. More to thepoint, it brought Cameron alive for me. This very well written, entertainingand exciting work deserves to be widely regarded as one of the bestbooks of 2011!"Stephen Sennitt, author of The Infernal Texts: Nox and Liber Koth.<br><br>"Wormwood Star is a fascinating and very, very well-researched look into Cameron's perplexingly strange life. Crisscrossing the country and tracking down all of the various characters the author spoke to must have been quite a chore and, as a reader and long-time admirer of Cameron's work, I'm grateful for the attention Spencer Kansa paid to detail." Richard Metzger, Dangerous Minds.com<br><br>"Wormwood Star is a pulsating account of a vibrant individual. Someone who lived her life in a magickal way and whose legendary position in occult annals has been skillfully captured and shared in this well-researched bio."<br>- Spirituality Today.</p><h2>Against the Mark (The Raines of Wind Canyon)</h2><p>The perfect murder is a work of art&nbsp;<br><br>In one catastrophic instant, Haley Warren's estranged father was taken from her. She never got the chance to reconnect with him, so now she's doing it the only way she's got left: by proving the explosion that killed him was no accident.&nbsp;<br><br>When Tyler Brodie, the provocative and handsome P.I. hired by Haley, discovers that her father was investigating a suspected art theft, he knows his death is no coincidence.

Ty Brodie's eyes widened at the sight of the little man standing, fists clenched and red-faced, in the doorway of Riggs and Brodie Private Investigations. "What the hell?"<br><br>Pug Calloway was no more than five foot five, barrel-chested and brawny, and he was fire-spittin' mad.<br><br>"Mess with my wife, will you?" Pug swung hard, but Ty, being six-two, dodged the first punch simply by stepping out of the way. "Hold on, Mr. Calloway&#x2014;you've got this all wrong."<br><br>"Bullshit! I saw you with my Nettie down at the Cockadoodle Inn." Another punch sailed out, straight from the shoulder. Determined not to hurt the older man, somewhere in his sixties, Ty danced backward out of arm's reach.<br><br>"We were talking business, Mr. Calloway. I'm a private investigator. Your wife hired me to look into some personal matters for her."<br><br>"Liar!" Pug's left arm shot out, two sharp jabs that sailed harmlessly into the air, followed by a right cross that would have been painful if it had connected.<br><br>After five years in the Marines, Ty was more afraid of hurting the old guy than Pug doing any real damage.<br><br>"Listen to me, Mr. Calloway&#x2014;"<br><br>Pug swung a punch that whizzed past his jaw. "She's mine, you understand? You stay away from her!"<br><br>"Dammit! I wasn't trying to steal your wife!" He clamped a hand over Calloway's head, holding him back as the little man swung several more harmless blows. "All right, Pug&#x2014;that's enough."<br><br>Ty shoved the shorter man backward hard enough to make him stumble. He heard a noise behind him and glanced over his shoulder to see his next-door neighbor, Ellie Stiles, standing beside a long-legged, good-looking blonde in tight jeans and a crop-top that showed tanned skin and a sexy silver belly-button ring.<br><br>He flashed a grin the instant before Pug Calloway's fist connected with his nose. Ty flew backward, tripped, went ass-over-teakettle and landed hard, the impact sending him sliding across the tile floor to wind up at the women's feet.<br><br>"Don't call me Pug," the little man growled. "Only my Nettie calls me that."<br><br>Ty glared up at Pug, whose fists were still clenched, ready to hit him again. Catching a glimpse of the pretty blonde's smile, Ty felt a rush of heat to the back of his neck that slowly crept into his face.<br><br>"For chrissake, man. I wasn't trying to steal your wife." Nettie was old enough to be his grandmother. He used the hem of his white T-shirt to wipe away the blood leaking out of his nose. "Nettie hired me to follow you. She thought you were cheating on her."<br><br>Pug's bushy gray eyebrows shot up. "That's crazy.<br><br>Why would she think that? I love Nettie. I'd never cheat on her."<br><br>"Yeah, well, that's what I told her." He rolled to his feet, checking his nose, relieved to find it wasn't broken&#x2014;it just felt that way. "Now if you don't mind, I have better things to do than solve your marital problems."<br><br>Pug just grinned. "She really thought I was cheating? She was jealous?"<br><br>"Yeah, so why don't you go home and show her how much you love her? You might use some of that energy you're wasting on me for a better purpose."<br><br>Pug's irritating grin widened. "Good idea." The little man started walking, stopped and turned back. "Sorry about your nose."<br><br>Ty scowled as he shoved to his feet. "You'll be even sorrier when you get my bill."<br><br>Pug just smiled. Chest puffed out, he headed for the door. The P.I. office occupied the lower floor of the house Ty's partner, John Riggs, lived in with his wife, Amy. It had once been the guesthouse on Ellie's Hollywood Hills estate. The smaller house had been a wedding gift from Ellie, the silver-haired woman now standing at the bottom of the porch stairs.<br><br>Remembering she was still there, Ty turned, and Ellie handed him a wet washcloth she had retrieved from the bathroom.<br><br>"Thanks." Tipping his head back, he pressed the cold cloth beneath his nose, stanching the flow of blood. He tried not to look at the blonde, who was still grinning, digging a pair of dimples into her cheeks.<br><br>"I see you had a little misunderstanding with Mr. Calloway," Ellie said dryly. At seventy-one, she was still pretty, still kept a trim, athletic figure. She lived in the big house up the hill, and her mind was as sharp as the day she was born.<br><br>"I guess when you referred his wife to me as a client, you neglected to mention her husband was the jealous type."<br><br>Ellie sighed. "Well, knowing Pug and Nannette for so many years, I suppose I should have said something."<br><br>Ty grunted. "I suggest you make sure things get straightened out between them."<br><br>"Oh, I will." She hid a smile as she turned. "In the meantime, I've got another client for you. Tyler Bro-die, I'd like you to meet my grandniece, Haley Warren. Haley's out here from Chicago. Her grandmother was my sister."<br><br>Just to regain a little of his dignity, Ty let his gaze roam over her, starting at the frosted-pink toenails peeking out of strappy high-heeled, open-toed sandals, sliding up a pair of long legs in snug-fitting jeans, across that bare midriff with its glittering belly-button ring over a set of nicely rounded breasts to a pretty face framed by long, softly curling honey blond hair.<br><br>She had big blue eyes, and an Angelina Jolie mouth that made him think of dirty sex. Maybe she read his thoughts for a faint blush rose in her cheeks.<br><br><em>Good.</em> A little payback only seemed fair.<br><br>Besides, she was a real pleasure to look at. Not beautiful in the classic sense like some of the women he knew, but with those dimples and big blue eyes, she was way beyond cute.<br><br>"Nice to meet you, Ms. Warren."<br><br>The smile was gone and she assessed him coolly. "Aunt Ellie tells me you're a friend, as well as an investigator."<br><br>"I like to think that's true."<br><br>"Of course it's true," Ellie said. "That's why I know we can count on Ty to help us."<br><br>Wariness slid through him. Ellie had a way of bringing him clients who were nothing but trouble. "How's that?"<br><br>"Well, you see, three months ago Haley's father died when his powerboat exploded."<br><br>"I'm sorry for your loss," he said to her.<br><br>Grief flashed in her eyes an instant before she glanced away. "Thank you."<br><br>"At the time everyone thought it was an accident," Ellie continued, "a gas leak of some kind that turned deadly. Haley's stepmother doesn't believe it. About a month ago, Betty Jean started emailing Haley, trying to convince her to come to Los Angeles and help her find out the truth."<br><br>Ty focused on the leggy blonde. "And you think she's right because.. "<br><br>"I don't know if she's right or not. I've never met her. Before he died, my father and I had been estranged for nearly five years, ever since he left my mother and ran off with another woman."<br><br>"Betty Jean," he said, just to make sure he was getting this straight.<br><br>"That's right. After he moved to L.A., Dad tried to mend our relationship, but I just. I couldn't get past his desertion." She glanced down and her eyes misted. "Now my father's gone."<br><br>Ty nodded, beginning to get the picture. "So your dad's dead and you regret not mending your fences."<br><br>"Yes, I do. Very much. But the thing is, some of the things Betty Jean says make sense. I owe it to my father to find out what really happened."<br><br>He flicked a glance at Ellie, whose features looked a little too bland to suit him. "I take it you're here to convince me to help her."<br><br>"That's right. You know how good you are at these things, Tyler. I know Johnnie's out of town but Haley will be helping you. That'll save you from having to do everything by yourself."<br><br>Haley would be helping him. He could think of any number of things he'd like her to do for him, but none of them had anything to do with business. The fact was Haley Warren was Ellie's niece. Seducing her probably wasn't a good idea.<br><br>"Have you talked to the police?"<br><br>"Betty Jean has," Haley answered. "The police said there was nothing to indicate any sort of foul play. But my stepmother isn't convinced and if she's right&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'll tell you what. I'll look into the circumstances of the accident, see if anything looks suspicious. I've got friends in the department. If something's not right, I'll talk to them myself."<br><br>Haley reached over and caught his arm. He felt a little zing of awareness and figured she must have felt it, too, since she stepped back as if she'd been burned.<br><br>She glanced away, took a deep breath and forced her eyes back to his face. "I want to be involved in this, Mr. Brodie. I need to find out for myself. I owe it to my father to find out the truth."<br><br>"It's just Ty, and I can get things done faster if I work alone."<br><br>"I want to be there when you talk to Betty Jean. I want to hear what she has to say."<br><br>He figured Haley also wanted to find out why her father had dumped her mother and run off with another woman. Probably someone younger and prettier, the usual motivation. Truth was, it didn't really matter if Haley went along. And it might help the stepmother open up.<br><br>"All right, when I go you can come with me. Make an appointment with Betty Jean, and you can fill me in on what you know on the way. I gather you're staying with your aunt."<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"When would you like to go?"<br><br>"How about tomorrow morning?" Ellie suggested, the twinkle in her eyes warning him he had just stepped into another of her traps.<br><br>Or maybe he was just being paranoid. Maybe this time Ellie was just trying to help her niece. He reminded himself that as pretty as Haley was, getting involved with her wasn't an option&#x2014;not for either one of them. Not when Ellie Stiles was such a good friend.<br><br>Night had settled over the valley below the house by the time Haley got home after supper. Her aunt Ellie had taken her to a little bistro called Le Petit Four on Sunset Strip, and though the food was excellent, Haley hadn't really been hungry.<br><br>She hadn't had her usual appetite since she had received the news of her father's death. But she had already lost four pounds so she'd forced herself to eat, and the broiled halibut with a Parmesan crust and lime butter had been delicious.<br><br>With a tired sigh, she drew back the blue satin coverlet on her bed in the guest wing of her aunt's opulent Hollywood Hills home and slid between the Egyptian cotton sheets.<br><br>The house was at least eight thousand square feet, perched on a hillside, modern in design, white stucco with dark brown trim, a flat roof and a four-car garage. There was an infinity pool on the lower level of the yard, a deck off the living room and bedrooms that stretched across the entire back of the house, with spectacular views of the L.A. basin.<br><br>With its twelve-foot ceilings, the inside was equally impressive, the decor also modern, a showcase for the valuable contemporary art collection Ellie and her late husband, movie mogul Harry Stiles, had amassed before his death.<br><br>Haley hadn't been to visit her aunt since her parents divorced five years ago. At the time, she had just turned twenty-one and was finishing her degree in fine art at the University of Chicago. Art was an interest she and her parents had shared, kind of a family tradition that even her great-aunt and her husband, Harry, had enjoyed. Allison Warren, Haley's mother, had started taking her to galleries when she was just a child.<br><br>Armed with both an art history degree and one in art design, for the past four years she'd been working at the Seymour Gallery in downtown Chicago. She'd hoped her dad would come to one of the openings she arranged for both up-and-coming and well-known artists.<br><br>Her heart squeezed. She'd always believed that in time she and her dad would talk things out, breach the rift between them. But the years had slipped past and now her father was dead.<br><br>Not just dead, Haley amended.<br><br>According to her stepmother, her father had been murdered.<br><br>Haley thought of the woman she had never met. <em>Betty Jean.</em> She sounded like a waitress in an Alabama biker bar. Or some kind of country bumpkin. <em>Have you heard the joke about the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter, Betty Jean?</em> Just the whisper of her name at the back of Haley's mind made her stomach burn.<br><br>The woman had to be some big-busted bimbo with bleached blond hair and no morals, just the sort a good man like James Warren would fall prey to. Nothing like her mother, who enjoyed the opera and symphony and was a patron of the arts.<br><br>Her father had been extremely intelligent. Before the divorce, he had been working for her grandfather as president of the Wentworth Insurance Group. Then he'd met Betty Jean Simmons when he was in L.A. on business. Six months later, he quit his high-powered job, left his wife, abandoned his daughter and moved to California.<br><br>Tomorrow Haley would meet the woman who had destroyed her family.<br><br>A light knock sounded at the door. Haley turned as the door cracked open and her aunt poked her head into the bedroom. "Oh, good, you're still awake. So, what did you think?"<br><br>Haley scooted backward until her shoulders came up against the headboard. "What did I think about what?"<br><br>"Why, Tyler, of course."<br><br>She thought of the man her aunt had insisted accompany her in the morning. Tyler Brodie. "He looks like a college boy. And he fights like a wimp."<br><br>Ellie laughed. "He's thirty years old, and he's no wimp. Ty spent six years in the Marines before he moved here from Dallas. He just didn't want to hurt poor Pug, is all."<br><br>She remembered the punch Ty had taken and bit back a smile. Clearly, he had been trying not to hurt the older man.<br><br>"He's good at his job," Ellie added. "If the accident that killed your father was more than that, Ty will help you find out."<br><br>Ellie had told her a little about Tyler Brodie. That he was raised in Texas and had been working as an investigator for the past three years. She'd neglected to mention he was handsome as sin with a body to match. Tall and rangy, with dark brown hair a little too long and interesting hazel eyes that seemed to change color with the light.<br><br>He had shoulders that would fill a door frame and an impressive set of biceps that stretched the sleeves of his plain white T-shirt and hinted at the solid muscles underneath. He had a V-shaped body with a lean waist and long legs that ended in a pair of scuffed leather cowboy boots.<br><br>"I hope he's as good as you say. I guess we'll know more after I talk to Betty Jean."<br><br>"So you called her?"<br><br>Haley nodded. "We're supposed to be at her house at ten tomorrow morning."<br><br>Ellie smiled. "Then I guess I'd better let you get some sleep. Good night, dear. I'll see you in the morning."<br><br>"Good night, Aunt Ellie."<br><br>Her aunt closed the door, and Haley's thoughts returned to the man who would be taking her to meet her stepmother. Her girlfriends in Chicago would call Ty a hottie. Fortunately for Haley, she had never been one of those women who fell dumbstruck in the presence of a particularly virile male.<br><br>The only reason she was letting him come along was that her aunt had insisted. Brodie was a trained investigator. Since Aunt Ellie had even more money than Haley's mother's family and was paying his fees&#x2014;however extravagant they might be&#x2014;Haley had agreed to accept his help.<br><br>Besides, the thought of facing Betty Jean Simmons&#x2014;now Warren&#x2014;by herself was daunting.<br><br>Haley closed her eyes, shutting out the distant spots of colored light blinking through the huge plate-glass windows on the far side of the bedroom. She should have closed the drapes, but the lights kept ...</p><h2>The Beduins&#39; Gazelle (Harper Trophy Books (Paperback))</h2><p>When she and he were only babies, they were pledged in marriage.

About her third book she wrote, "The Ramsay Scallop is about our need for adventure and motion, for throwing in with strangers, trusting and listening. The story began to take form in northern Spain along pilgrim trails; was fed by histories, stories, letters, by the testimony of a fourteenthcentury shepherd, by the thoughts of today's pilgrims. Concerns echo across years-clean water, good talk, risks welcomed, the search for a peaceful heart. Traveling in Elenor's shoes, I found out how strongly the tradition of pilgrimage continues."Ms. Temple received many honors during her distinguished career. Her other critically acclaimed books for young people include: FranceTaste of Salt A Story of Modern Haiti, winner of the 1993 Jane Addams Children's Book Award; Grab hands and Run, cited by SchoolLibrary journal as one of the Best Books of 1993; and Tonight, by Sea another novel set in Haiti.</p>Grade 5-8?The year is 1302 and Halima, the gazelle of the title, is betrothed to her cousin Atiyah. The young people look forward to the wedding, but their happiness is postponed. Saladeen, a powerful kinsman, sends Atiyah to Fez. He insists the young man must study the Koran, purportedly in order to unite warring factions in the tribe, but actually to strengthen his own position with the Caliph. Atiyah loathes leaving the desert, but believes his actions will please the Archangel Gabriel and bring much needed rain. Meanwhile, while migrating in search of water, Halima falls into the hands of the enemy tribe whose sheikh decides to make her his youngest wife. With the help of his foreign friend Etienne, Atiyah sets out to rescue his beloved. There are fascinating glimpses of everyday life here: Beduin women gathering camel hair for rugs, university students arguing in the classroom, men bursting forth into poetry as they come together for horse trading and camel racing. While telling this romantic tale, Temple also touches upon conflicts within the larger society, e.g., the Beduin way of life versus that of the educated urban mullahs, and the struggle between Islam and Christianity. As in Suzanne Staples's Shabanu (Knopf, 1989), this story shows young people striving to reconcile their individual hopes and dreams with the demands of a traditional society.

Barsness offers his own research on technique and grounds these methods with superb contributions from several master clinicians, expanding the seven primary competencies: therapeutic intent, therapeutic stance/attitude; analytic listening/attunement; working within the relational dynamic, the use of patterning and linking; the importance of working through the inevitable enactments and ruptures inherent in the work; and the use of courageous speech through disciplined spontaneity. </p> <p>In addition, this book presents a history of Relational Psychoanalysis, offers a study on the efficacy of Relational Psychoanalysis, proposes a new relational ethic and attends to the the importance of self-care in working within the intensity of such a model. A critique of the model is offered, issues of race and culture and gender and sexuality are addressed, as well as current research on neurobiology and its impact in the development of the model. The reader will find the writings easy to understand and accessible, and immediately applicable within the therapeutic setting. The practical emphasis of this text will also offer non-analytic clinicians a window into the mind of the analyst, while increasing the settings and populations in which this model can be applied and facilitate integration with other therapeutic orientations.</p> <p><i>Core Competencies of Relational Psychoanalysis </i>is inspired by Barsness&#x2019; students; he was motivated to create a primary text that could assist them in understanding the often complex and abstract models of Relational Psychoanalysis. Relevant for graduate students and novice therapists as well as experienced clinicians, supervisors, and professors, this textbook offers a foundational curriculum for the study of Relational Psychoanalysis, presents analytic technique with as clear a frame and purpose as evidenced based models, and serves as a gateway into further study in Relational Psychoanalyses.</p></p><p><p><strong>Roy E.

The authors outstanding success lies in their skilled address of the challenge in Relational Psychoanalysis to offer an approach that is flexibly attuned to the individuality of each patient/analyst dyad while practiced with a disciplined intent, form, and rhythm. The what and how to do is presented in seven competencies with a coda on love &#x2013; all becoming enlivened for the reader by clinical narratives. A difficult task well mastered."-</em><strong>Joseph D.

Both the carefully constructed mindset and the overall honoring of the work comes through in every chapter.

I have found it."-</em><strong>Francesca Giordano, Ph.D., </strong>Program Director, Clinical Professor, The Counseling Program, The Family Institute at Northwestern University.</p> <p><em>"Originally a reaction against the constricting orthodoxy and authoritarianism of an entrenched psychoanalytic establishment, relational psychoanalysis has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive paradigm representing the leading edge of psychoanalytic thought.&nbsp;This masterful volume, with contributions by luminaries of the relational movement, elucidates the core assumptions and competencies of relational psychoanalysis.&nbsp;Simultaneously sweeping in scope and scholarly in detail, it is essential reading for students and experienced clinicians alike."-</em><strong>Jonathan Shedler, Ph.D.</strong>, University of Colorado School of Medicine</p></p><h2>Playful Approaches to Serious Problems: Narrative Therapy with Children and their Families (Norton Professional Books (Hardcover))</h2><p><p><strong>The "grown-up talk" of therapy is likely to turn off children - especially if it focuses on their problematic behavior.

In <em>Language of the Spirit</em>, renowned music scholar Jan Swafford argues that we have it all wrong: classical music has something for everyone and is accessible to all. Ranging from Gregorian chant to Handel's <em>Messiah</em>, from Vivaldi's <em>The Four Seasons</em> to the postmodern work of Philip Glass, Swafford is an affable and expert guide to the genre. He traces the history of Western music, introduces readers to the most important composers and compositions, and explains the underlying structure and logic of their music.<br><br><em>Language of the Spirit</em> is essential reading for anyone who has ever wished to know more about this sublime art.<br></p><p><b>Jan Swafford</b> is a preeminent composer and music scholar and the author of bestselling <i>The Vintage Guide to Classical Music</i>. A regular contributor to <i>Slate</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, and the <i>Boston Globe </i>and a former professor of composition at the Boston Conservatory, Swafford lives in Medford, Massachusetts."<i>Language of the Spirit </i>includes an array of unpretentious, charming anecdotes, stories once universally known but (Mr. Swafford suspects) now need retelling. His book is perfect for people who are curious about classical music but feel somewhat intimidated by it."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This book distils [Jan Swafford's] experience of passing on his knowledge and experience to others, and making it enjoyable for them.... Between the stories of the composers, Mr. Swafford slips in many interesting digressions.... Mr. Swafford entertains as he informs. But in the end, music to him is a thing unto itself, "'a language of the spirit--its essence can't be captured in words.'"<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Economist</b></i></i></b><br><br>"A compact, reader-friendly volume... Swafford is a witty and impassioned guide to the great composers and the great masterpieces... Equally important for an introductory audience, he is intimately familiar with the rich layer of anecdotes that envelops the lives of the composers and enlivens every effective music history course... an upbeat, uninhibited romp through the repertoire."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Weekly Standard</b></i></i></b><br><br>"In this delightful primer to classical music, composer and music scholar Swafford (<i>The Vintage Guide to Classical Music</i>) conducts us breathlessly on a tour of the highlights of the history of classical music, from the beginnings of music up through the present....Swafford provides excellent suggestions for listening at the end of each chapter, and his entertaining and instructive book encourages us to listen to the breadth and depth of classical music for delight and pleasure."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A workable foundation from which readers can more deeply and broadly explore the music."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Booklist</b></i></i></b><br><br>"In <i>Language of the Spirit</i>, Jan Swafford achieves something very difficult: he captures the spirit of music in words. His series of short sketches of composers and their works ring true, and, more importantly, send you running to listen to the music for yourself."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Emanuel Ax, Pianist</b></i></b><br><br>"The genuine love of music is at the core of Jan Swafford's latest book. Unlike his previous works, which are primarily biographies,<i> Language of the Spirit</i> is a glimpse into Swafford's life. His is a journey into what music means on a highly personal level. It reminds those of us in the profession why we became musicians in the first place."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Leonard Slatkin, Conductor and Music Director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra</b></i></b><br><br>"Humbly and with great generosity of spirit, Jan Swafford opens the door to the world of classical music and encourages us to experience it through the emotions it evokes. He makes us realize that we are all equipped to approach this greatest of the arts, and helpfully gets us started off in the right direction."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ted Libbey, author of <i>The NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A perfect, lean compendium from a scintillating writer who knows profoundly where music comes from, and the geniuses who've made it best in the Western tradition. Composer and biographer on the grand scale, Jan Swafford has given us the last music book we'll ever need. The rest is listening!"<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Chris Lydon, host of Radio Open Source</b></i></b><br><br>"Once again Jan Swafford's engaging enthusiasm for classical music has produced a book which will enhance his reputation and bring much enjoyment to all who read it. As an introduction to classical music this is a book that should be read by all, young and old, who have a curiosity about classical music but who were never fortunate enough to meet a mentor such as Professor Swafford. It should be required reading in all schools!"<br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>John O'Conor, award-winning pianist and former Director of the Royal Irish Academy of Music</b></i></b></p><h2>Only Human (The Themis Files)</h2><p><b><i>Pacific Rim </i>meets <i>The Martian</i> in the explosive follow-up to <i>Sleeping Giants</i> (&#x201c;One of the most promising series kickoffs in recent memory.&#x201d;&#x2014;NPR) and <i>Waking Gods</i> (&#x201c;Pure, unadulterated literary escapism.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Brilliant scientist Rose Franklin has devoted her adult life to solving the mystery she accidentally stumbled upon as a child: a huge metal hand buried beneath the ground outside Deadwood, South Dakota.

We succeeded in destroying it, but thirteen more appeared and dispersed a genetically engineered gaseous weapon in two dozen of our most populous cities. One hundred million people died in the process. Among them, this mysterious man whose name I never learned, who steered our every move ever since I was put in charge of studying that giant hand at the University of Chicago, and Kara Resnik, my best friend, who was also Vincent&#x2019;s wife, and Eva&#x2019;s biological mother.<br><br>With some help, I found a way to alter the metal these robots were made of at the molecular level and disabled one of them. That was enough to convince the aliens to leave.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t say that I knew that was going to happen, that millions would die because I had discovered Themis and brought attention to our planet, but I was afraid it would. I was afraid ever since I was brought back to life. I felt . . . out of place, and I wished that whoever built Themis would come back and take her away. I also said I hoped they would take me with them.<br><br>They did. After the alien robots left Earth, General Eugene Govender, head of the EDC, Vincent, Eva, and I went aboard Themis to celebrate our&#x2014;I was going to say victory, but that&#x2019;s not what it was&#x2014;survival. While we were there, the Council of Akitast&#x2014;the group of aliens who decide how their world deals with others&#x2014;had Themis brought back. She dematerialized on Earth and reappeared on Themis&#x2019;s home planet, with the four of us inside.<br><br>They call it Esat Ekt&#x2014;Home of the Ekt, their people. In some small way, they&#x2019;re also our people. The Ekt first came to Earth some five thousand years ago&#x2014;twenty-four of them or so. They were among us for a couple of millennia. They were ordered never to interfere, to stay out of history&#x2019;s way, but over time, some of them frayed and joined the natives. They had children&#x2014;half-human, half-alien&#x2014;who in turn had children&#x2014;three-quarter human&#x2014;and so on, until their descendants, undistinguishable from humans, had but a tiny bit of alien genetics left in them. Three thousand years later, there was nothing left to distinguish them from. All of us, every single person on Earth, were related, however remotely, with the handful of aliens who chose love over duty, back when the Titans walked the Earth.<br><br>We have been living here on Esat Ekt for nine years now, but we are still very much outsiders. Their entire society is built on the idea that different species shouldn&#x2019;t interact in ways that can affect them, that each should be left to evolve according to its own set of values. Centuries ago, their kind was nearly decimated by the inhabitants of a planet their emperor had displaced, exiled for personal or political reasons. After that, they replaced their monarchy with a very complex democracy, and took their noninterference policy to a whole new level. To the Ekt, &#x201c;polluting&#x201d; an entire species with their genetics means robbing them of the future they should have. They view this as we would genocide. What happened on Earth was a tragedy for them as much as it was for us. They came to exterminate what they thought were a handful of Ekt descendants before they could contaminate all of us. When they realized they were too late, they had already killed millions. We are living reminders of what they consider a stain on their history, like the Holocaust Memorial, or a monument to the victims of slavery.<br><br>They will not be reminded anymore.

Just like last time.<br><br>[Last time we almost died.]<br><br>Then not like last time. Look, there&#x2019;s nothing I can do. If I knew how to speed this up, believe me I would.<br><br>&#x2014;Go talk to Ekim, Eva. You have some time. You should talk to him.

A hundred million of us died the last time his people were on Earth. It&#x2019;s been a while, but I don&#x2019;t think folks here would&#x2019;ve forgotten.<br><br>&#x2014;What will happen to him when he gets back home?<br><br>&#x2014;Well, he&#x2019;ll tell them we kidnapped him&#x2014;we did. Hopefully, they&#x2019;ll end it at that.<br><br>&#x2014;Do you think they&#x2019;ll believe him?<br><br>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know, Rose. What would you have me do? Write him a note?<br><br>&#x2014;He looks scared.<br><br>&#x2014;He&#x2019;s a kid! He&#x2019;s millions of miles away from home, and he may have just committed treason. I&#x2019;d be scared too.<br><br>&#x2014;You put a gun to his head.<br><br>&#x2014;Like I said, I&#x2019;d be scared too.<br><br>&#x2014;We just traveled millions of miles ourselves, you know.<br><br>&#x2014;Weird, isn&#x2019;t it? We&#x2019;ve waited all this time, then, boom. We&#x2019;re here.<br><br>&#x2014;Our . . . friend once told me it took ten days to get from there to here. It just feels instantaneous.

We can get the date here, but what we&#x2019;d need to know is the date over there, now. How do you get that? You go back, divide by two?<br><br>&#x2014;I have no idea.

A crane isn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;m worried about.<br><br>[What then?]<br><br>They might just be locals in some pickup trucks. If they are, we&#x2019;re still good.

I trust you had a good night&#x2019;s sleep. I&#x2019;m sure you did. We have really good drugs . . . Don&#x2019;t tell anyone, but I take some from time to time when I need the rest. I never thought I&#x2019;d get to do this, but on behalf of the Russian Federation, and the entire planet, I suppose, welcome back! And welcome to Russia!<br><br>&#x2014;We&#x2019;re in Russia?<br><br>&#x2014;Yeah! You are! Sit down, Dr. Franklin. You&#x2019;re making me nervous.<br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry. I am a bit nervous. I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing here.<br><br>&#x2014;Oh, you have every right to be nervous, Dr. Franklin. I said you were making me nervous. I&#x2019;m supposed to look superconfident. That&#x2019;s hard to do if I&#x2019;m fidgeting in my seat. But this is so exciting! Please sit!<br><br>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ll tell me who you are, or where I am.<br><br>&#x2014;Who I am? Doesn&#x2019;t it say on . . . Where is it? There&#x2019;s a little plaque with my name on it . . . Oh, here it is. I&#x2019;m Katherine Lebedev.<br><br>&#x2014;You don&#x2019;t sound Russian.<br><br>&#x2014;I hope not. I spent most of my life in New Hampshire. I went to Brown. Law school.<br><br>&#x2014;You were a spy.<br><br>&#x2014;I wa . . . No! I was a kid. I was born there. I played with dolls. My parents were spies. I didn&#x2019;t find out about any of it until it was time to leave. I moved back here eleven years ago, and here we are! I was saying something. Oh yes. I&#x2019;m Katherine Lebedev. I&#x2019;m a major in the GRU.<br><br>&#x2014; . . . <br><br>&#x2014;You don&#x2019;t know what that is, do you? The Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Mouthful, I know.<br><br>&#x2014;It sounds like the KGB.<br><br>&#x2014;The KGB&#x2014;it&#x2019;s called the SVR nowadays, by the way&#x2014;is for kids. Don&#x2019;t tell them I said that. We&#x2019;re ten times bigger than the SVR. OK, maybe not ten times, but we&#x2019;re it. This is where the fun is. We have six times the numbers of agents, spy satellites, James Bond stuff. What else did you wanna know? Oh yes, you&#x2019;re in&#x2014;we&#x2019;re in Saint Petersburg. Government office. Big grey building.<br><br>&#x2014;Are you the head of this . . . GRU?<br><br>&#x2014;Me? I wish. No, I&#x2019;m a lowly major. I run a small&#x2014;tiny, really&#x2014;division focused on alien tech. We don&#x2019;t have any, so, like I said, it&#x2019;s small. Which is why you&#x2019;ll understand how happy I was, how happy we all were, when you landed in Estonia. Only a few hours away, really. What are the odds?<br><br>&#x2014;Estonia? You said we were in Russia?<br><br>&#x2014;Right! You don&#x2019;t know! I&#x2019;m sorry. Where are my manners? You have a lot of catching up to do. What do you wanna know? Ask away.<br><br>&#x2014;How long were we gone?<br><br>&#x2014;Nine years, three months, six days&#x2014;ninety-seven days&#x2014;nine years and ninety-seven days. I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t know the scientific way . . . <br><br>&#x2014;Nine years? We thought it was less than that.<br><br>&#x2014;Oh! Our scientists talked about that. Something about time dilation when traveling at near-light speed. I don&#x2019;t understand any of it, but they said you might come back a thousand years old. No, that can&#x2019;t be. A thousand years would have passed here. Can you tell I&#x2019;m not a scientist? So how long did you think you were gone for? A few seconds?<br><br>&#x2014;Eight years, seven months, maybe eight.<br><br>&#x2014;Oh . . . Wait? You don&#x2019;t know exactly?<br><br>&#x2014;We . . . Do you know where we were?<br><br>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m waiting for you to tell me, but everyone assumed you went to the planet where those robots are from.<br><br>&#x2014;Right. It&#x2019;s called . . . <br><br>&#x2014;What? It&#x2019;s called what? Oh, you don&#x2019;t know if you should tell me . . . It&#x2019;s really up to you. No, it&#x2019;s not really up to you, but you know what I mean. It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;ll torture you on your first day. I&#x2019;m kidding! GRU humor . . . I know. How about this? Do you think telling me the name of the place will forever upset the balance of power? Besides, you worked for the United Nations when you left. We&#x2019;re in there.

She swore she'd look after her sister, Troo. Keep her safe. But like her Granny always said-actions speak louder than words. Now, during the summer of 1959, the girls' mother is hospitalized, their stepfather has abandoned them for a six pack, and their big sister, Nell, is too busy making out with her boyfriend to notice that Sally and Troo are on the Loose. And so is a murderer and molester. <br><br> Highly imaginative Sally is pretty sure of two things. Who the killer is. And that she's next on his list. Now she has no choice but to protect herself and Troo as best she can, relying on her own courage and the kindness of her neighbors.</p><p>Lesley Kagen is an actress, voice-over talent, and restaurateur, as well as the author of two previous national bestselling novels. <i>Whistling in the Dark</i> has been translated into five languages and was a Midwest Choice Honor winner. <i>Land of a Hundred Wonders</i>, an Indie Next pick, was also nominated for a Midwest Choice Award. She lives near Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Chapter One <p>The morning Mother told us she was sick, Troo and mewere just laying in the lime summer grass, smellingthe bleach comin&#x2019; off the wash that jitterbugged onthe line and getting ready to play that name game with her.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s important for you to understand who you&#x2019;re dealingwith so you can know what to expect from them,&#x201d;Mother said, pulling another sheet out of the laundry basket.&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to remember that people are different inthe city.&#x201d;</p><p>How could we forget? She musta told us this over a gabilliontimes since we moved to the house on Vliet Street.We were a mother and her three girls. And I supposed I hadto count Hall, because that would be the charitable thing todo. Hall was Mother&#x2019;s husband. Her <i>third</i> husband.</p><p>Troo and me, we liked our own daddy better than Hall,but he died two summers ago after a car crash. He was onhis way back home to the farm after a Milwaukee Bravesgame. Our uncle Paulie, who was riding shotgun, wentthrough the windshield and got his brain damaged when hehit a fire hydrant so he had to go live with my Granny overon Fifty- ninth Street. Some man at his funeral called ourdaddy, Donny O&#x2019;Malley, lush. I didn&#x2019;t know what that meantso I looked it up the next day in that big dictionary they hadover at the library. <i>Lush</i> is an adjective that means luxurious.That man was right. My daddy <i>was</i> lush. Stuffed with lushness.Like a chocolate cake with chocolate filling and chocolatefrosting.</p><p>Mother shook out the wet white sheet and said, &#x201c;Andone of the ways you can know what to expect from somebodyis by knowing what country they originally came from.Right? People&#x2019;s last names can tell you just about everythingyou&#x2019;ll ever need to know about them.&#x201d;</p><p>Troo and me groaned because the name game was gettin&#x2019;kinda old and was about as much fun as a splinter underyour thumbnail, but Mother, she loved this name game evenbetter than Chinese checkers.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have all day.&#x201d; Mother gave us her do- you- smelldog-poop look, so Troo called out &#x201c;Latour?&#x201d; real quick.</p><p>Troo was gorgeous- looking. Red wavy hair that stoppedat her shoulders and freckles across her nose only. And shehad the kind of blue eyes that looked like the sky when it justwoke up in the morning and hadn&#x2019;t turned that blue jeancolor it got later on in the day. Troo was thin except at herlips, which were poofy and made her look a little pouty allthe time, which was true some of the time. And she had longfi ngers, which were good for playing the secondhand pianowe had in the living room. Mother thought pianos made afamily look high- class. Granny told me that piano businesswas a little stuck- up of her daughter since Mother grew up inMilwaukee just a few streets down from where we lived now.Right across the street from the Feelin&#x2019; Good Cookie Factory,which was known far and wide for its chocolate chipcookies. (What Granny really said, because she was alwayssayin&#x2019; stuff like this, was, &#x201c;Helen should know by now thatshe can&#x2019;t make a silk purse out of a sow&#x2019;s ear.&#x201d;)</p><p>Mother cupped her hand around her ear, so Troo yelledlouder, &#x201c;Latour?&#x201d;</p><p>Helen and Troo. &#x201c;Two peas in a pod,&#x201d; Granny also alwayssaid. &#x201c;Just look at &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t look like Troo. Or Mother. My eyes weren&#x2019;t bluelike theirs. Mine were green and they sat under eyebrowsthat were almost invisible to the naked eye but had somebulkiness to them. I was not as tall as Troo even though shewas younger than me. I had long legs but small feet andhands because I was born a month early. And I had no freckleson my face. Not one. But I had been told once or twicethat I had darling dimples and nice thick blonde hair thatMother and Nell got in an argument over every morningwhen they tried to put it into one fat braid that went downmy back. Nell was my other sister. But only a half of one.Nell&#x2019;s father was Mother&#x2019;s <i>first</i> husband, who she told medied of smelling ammonia.</p><p>Mother answered, &#x201c;Latour is French.&#x201d; She took a littlewhiff of her wrist that I knew would smell like Evening inParis, her favorite. &#x201c;The French speak the language oflove.&#x201d;</p><p>Troo wasn&#x2019;t even paying attention. She was lookin&#x2019; overat our next- door neighbor&#x2019;s house and wondering if the storieswe&#x2019;d been hearing about the place were true. Because wewere sisters born only ten months apart, which made uspractically twins, her and me could have the mental telepathythat lets you read somebody else&#x2019;s mind even if they don&#x2019;twant you to, so I pretty much always knew what Troo wasthinking. &#x201c;Kenfield?&#x201d; she hollered out.</p><p> &#x201c;Kenfield is English,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;They like to keep astiff upper lip. That means they don&#x2019;t like to show whatthey&#x2019;re feeling.&#x201d; She bent down to take another sheet out ofthe basket, and when she did her hair came undone from thewhite ribbon. I was always surprised by how long it was.And when the sun shined on it, even though it was red, youcould see the gold hiding in it. I thought she was more beautifulthan the movie star Maureen O&#x2019;Hara. And so must themen on the block because they set their beer bottles downwhen she walked by and sometimes, if those beer bottleswere all drunk up, they gave her a low wolf whistle she pretendednot to hear.</p><p>Troo nudged me with her elbow and started giggling.&#x201c;O&#x2019;Malley.&#x201d;</p><p>Mother shook her finger and said, &#x201c;Troo O&#x2019;Malley, beingsilly never got anybody anywhere in life.&#x201d; But the cornersof her mouth went up just a smidge to let us know thatwe were better than everybody else and not just potato headsor micks, as the kids on the block who were Italian and Polishand German liked to call us. We called them wops (loud,but great cooks) and Polacks (not so smart) and bohunks(thick- ankled), so I figured it all came out in the wash.</p><p>Somebody down the block yelled, &#x201c;Ollie, Ollie, oxenfree,&#x201d; and Little Richard singing &#x201c;Tutti Frutti&#x201d; drifted byout of a car radio. That&#x2019;s how it was on Vliet Street. Somethinglively was always going on. Except for dead Junie Piaskowski,who everyone on the block said was murdered andmolested. Sara Heinemann hadn&#x2019;t been murdered and molestedyet when Mother fastened the last clothespin on theline and said, &#x201c;O&#x2019;Malley sisters, come over here. I have somethingto tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course, I let Troo sit next to Mother on the stonebench near the pink peony flowers that were falling all overthemselves because I made my daddy a couple of promisesbefore he died. And if there is one thing you&#x2019;re gonna get toknow about me, it&#x2019;s that I was a girl who wouldn&#x2019;t break apromise even if her life depended on it.</p><p>Right when the sun was going behind the trees, Daddymade everybody else go out of the hospital room and askedme to come lie down next to him in his bed that he couldmake go up and down whenever he wanted.</p><p>&#x201c;Sally?&#x201d; He had all these tubes coming out of him. Andnext to him was a machine that <i>ping ping pinged</i> just like thesubmarine in that movie Troo and me had seen at the UptownTheater called <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Daddy?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t look so much like himself anymore.His face was swelled up and he had cuts around hismouth and bits of blood that didn&#x2019;t seem to wash off. Alsohe had a big purple circle bruise from the steering wheel goinginto his chest. Something had collapsed in there, the oldnurse said.&#x201c;You need to take care of Troo,&#x201d; Daddy said ever so quietly.His usually fluffy red- as- a-pile- of- fall- leaves hair cameinto points on his forehead. &#x201c;You need to promise me that.&#x201d;</p><p>I patted his hand that felt smooth because the old nursehad just put some cream on it. &#x201c;I promise. I&#x2019;ll take care ofTroo. Cross my heart. But I gotta tell you something reallyimportant, I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have to tell Troo for me that it&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Daddy interrupted.&#x201c;Tell her the crash wasn&#x2019;t her fault.&#x201d;</p><p>Troo was in the hospital too, down the hall from Daddy,because she was also in the car when it ran into that big elmtree on Holly Road. Since she was sitting in the backseat,she didn&#x2019;t get as hurt as Daddy or Uncle Paulie. She just gota broken arm that ached sometimes now before it was gonnarain.</p><p>Daddy took in a breath like it was the hardest thing he&#x2019;dever done, and when he let it out he said, &#x201c;And tell yourmother that I forgive her for what she did. Promise?&#x201d; Thenhe started coughing some more and a little pink spit cameup onto his lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be watching, Sally. Remember . . . thingscan happen when you least expect them so you always gottabe prepared. And pay attention to the details. The de vil is inthe details.&#x201d; Then Daddy went to sleep for a minute butwoke up again and said, &#x201c;And Nell is not the worst big sisterin the world. There are one or two that&#x2019;re worse.&#x201d;</p><p>The old nurse came back into the room then and saidDaddy was either delirious or hilarious. I couldn&#x2019;t quitecatch it because she had a funny way of talking.</p><p>Troo&#x2019;s fault that Daddy was in the hospital? How couldall this be Troo&#x2019;s fault? Troo couldn&#x2019;t drive a car, she wasonly seven years old! Oh, Daddy. And I had no idea what hewanted to forgive Mother for and why he couldn&#x2019;t tell herhimself, but maybe it was because she was crazy with grieflike the doctor said.</p><p>Even though Daddy had fallen asleep, I whispered,&#x201c;Roger, wilco and out.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s how we always said good- byeto each other. Just like Penny said good- bye to her uncle SkyKing when he was up in the clear blue of the western sky inhis plane the <i>Songbird</i>. Daddy and me just adored that TVshow, watched it together every single Saturday morningbecause Daddy was a pilot, too.</p><p>And then the old nurse said, &#x201c;Visiting hours are over.&#x201d;&#x201c;But I gotta...,&#x201d; I tried to say, but she shook her headin a way that I knew there&#x2019;d be no gettin&#x2019; around. What Iwanted to tell him would have to wait until tomorrow. I putmy hand on his whiskery chin and turned his face towardmine so I could give him a butterfly kiss on his cheek, becausethat was his absolute favorite, and then an Eskimo kisson his nose because that was my absolute favorite.</p><p>Daddy&#x2019;s funeral was three days after I made him thosepromises. I never did get to tell him I was sorry.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Classic Rock Fake Book: Over 250 Great Songs of the Rock Era, Arranged for Piano, Vocal, Guitar, Electronic Keyboard an all &#39;C&#39; Instruments</h2><p>An invaluable collection of over 250 of the best rock songs of all time, with nearly 70 new songs added for this spectacular 2nd Edition!

How often can you say about a harrowing, unquiet book that it makes you wrestle with your soul?" &#x2015;Neel Mukherjee, <i>The Times</i> (London)</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>It's 1948 and the Arab villagers of Khirbet Khizeh are about to be violently expelled from their homes. A young Israeli soldier who is on duty that day finds himself battling on two fronts: with the villagers and, ultimately, with his own conscience.<br> Published just months after the founding of the state of Israel and the end of the 1948 war, the novella <i>Khirbet Khizeh</i> was an immediate sensation when it first appeared. Since then, the book has continued to challenge and disturb, even finding its way onto the school curriculum in Israel. The various debates it has prompted would themselves make <i>Khirbet Khizeh</i> worth reading, but the novella is much more than a vital historical document: it is also a great work of art. Yizhar's haunting, lyrical style and charged view of the landscape are in many ways as startling as his wrenchingly honest view of modern Israel's primal scene.<br> Considered a modern Hebrew masterpiece, <i>Khirbet Khizeh</i> is an extraordinary and heartbreaking book that is destined to be a classic of world literature.</p></p><p><p><b>S. Yizhar</b> was the pen name of Yizhar Smilansky, born in Rehovot in 1916. A longtime member of the Knesset, he is most famous as the author of <i>Khirbet Khizeh</i> and the untranslated magnum opus <i>Days of Ziklag</i>. He died in 2006. <b>Nicholas de Lange</b>, a professor emeritus of Hebrew and Jewish studies at Cambridge University, has translated many Hebrew novels, including <i>Preliminaries</i> by S. Yizhar (2007). <b>Yaacob Dweck</b> translated Haim Sabato's <i>The Dawning of the Day</i> (2006). He is an assistant professor of history and Judaic studies at Princeton University. <b>David Shulman</b> teaches Sanskrit and other Indian languages at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He has published numerous books and is the author of <i>Dark Hope: Working for Peace in Israel and Palestine</i> (2007). Shulman was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1987.</p><p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>TRUE, IT ALL HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, but it has haunted me ever since. I sought to drown it out with the din of passing time, to diminish its value, to blunt its edge with the rush of daily life, and I even, occasionally, managed a sober shrug, managed to see that the whole thing had not been so bad after all, congratulating myself on my patience, which is, of course, the brother of true wisdom. But sometimes I would shake myself again, astonished at how easy it had been to be seduced, to be knowingly led astray and join the great general mass of liars&#x2014;that mass compounded of crass ignorance, utilitarian indifference, and shameless self-interest&#x2014;and exchange a single great truth for the cynical shrug of a hardened sinner. I saw that I could no longer hold back, and although I hadn&#x2019;t even made up my mind where it would end, it seemed to me that, in any case, instead of staying silent, I should, rather, start telling the story. </p> <p>One option is to tell the story in order, beginning with one clear day, one clear winter&#x2019;s day, and describing in detail the departure and the journey, when the dirt paths were moistened by the earlier rain, and the cactus hedges surrounding the citrus groves were burned by the sun and moist, their feet, as of old, licked by flocks of dense damp dark-green nettles, as the noonday gradually advanced, a pleasant unhurried noonday, which moved on as usual and turned into a darkening twilight chill, when it was all over, finished, done. </p> <p>Another and possibly better option, however, would be to begin differently, and to mention straightaway what had been the purpose of that entire day from the start, &#x201c;operational order&#x201d; number such and such, on such and such day of the month, in the margin of which, in the final section that was simply entitled &#x201c;miscellaneous,&#x201d; it said, in a short line and a half, that although the mission must be executed decisively and precisely, whatever happened, &#x201c;no violent outbursts or disorderly conduct&#x201d;&#x2014;it said&#x2014;&#x201c;would be permitted,&#x201d; which only indicated straightaway that there was something amiss, that anything was possible (and even planned and foreseen), and that one couldn&#x2019;t evaluate this straightforward final clause before returning to the opening and also scanning the noteworthy clause entitled &#x201c;information,&#x201d; which immediately warned of the mounting danger of &#x201c;infiltrators,&#x201d; &#x201c;terrorist cells,&#x201d; and (in a wonderful turn of phrase) &#x201c;operatives dispatched on hostile missions,&#x201d; but also the subsequent and even more noteworthy clause, which explicitly stated, &#x201c;assemble the inhabitants of the area extending from point <i>X</i> (see attached map) to point <i>Y</i> (see same map)&#x2014;load them onto transports, and convey them across our lines; blow up the stone houses, and burn the huts; detain the youths and the suspects, and clear the area of &#x2018;hostile forces,&#x2019;&#x201d; and so on and so forth&#x2014;so that it was now obvious how many good and honest hopes were being invested in those who were being sent out to implement all this &#x201c;burn-blow-up-imprison-load-convey,&#x201d; who would burn blow up imprison load and convey with such courtesy and with a restraint born of true culture, and this would be a sign of a wind of change, of decent upbringing, and, perhaps, even of the Jewish soul, the great Jewish soul. </p> <p>And so it happened as we set out that clear splendid winter morning, cheerfully making our way, showered, well fed, and smartly turned out; and so, in the light breeze, we got out at a certain point close to a village that wasn&#x2019;t yet visible, and our company was dispatched to the flank, while some of the others were to cover the rear and the rest were to enter the village. And as usual there was nothing better than being in the flanking company. Which was moving off through unknown territory, setting out into the washed, cleansed existence of the fields, the pure pellucid air, among plantations partly plowed (from before the rage), and partly covered with weeds and grass (from the days of rage)&#x2014;and it was so pleasant to slosh around on the muddy paths slippery with puddles and fresh mire, until your youth, albeit no longer so very youthful, burst forth with renewed vigor. Even carrying the &#x201c;mission-case,&#x201d; which cut into your hand, might be transformed now and resemble nothing more than something or other that belonged to a group of people walking, let&#x2019;s say, to work or even, for example, a flock of chirping sparrowlike urchins. There we were sloshing, talking and chattering, joking and singing, not noisily, but cheerfully, and it was clear: there was to be no battle for us today, and if anyone happened to feel apprehensive&#x2014;this had nothing to do with us, God help him, today we were going on an outing. </p> <p>We reached a hill, where we crouched under a cactus hedge, and we were ready to eat something, when the man, one Moishe, the company commander, gathered us together, and briefed us about the situation, the lay of the land, and the objective. From which it transpired that the few houses on the lower slope of another hill were some Khirbet Khizeh or other, and all the surrounding crops and fields belonged to that village, whose abundant water, good soil, and celebrated husbandry had gained a reputation almost equal to that of its inhabitants, who were, they said, a band of ruffians, who gave succor to the enemy, and were ready for any mischief should the opportunity only arise; or, for example, should they happen to encounter any Jews you could be sure they would wipe them out, at once&#x2014;such was their nature, and such were their ways. And when we fixed our sights upon those few houses on the flanks of that unobtrusive hill, from which we were separated by the plantations, the well-tended gardens, and a scattering of wells, we saw that this whole Khirbet Khizeh presented no problem, truly did not justify any further explanation. On the other hand, there were some trees, sycamores apparently, here and there, so venerable and tranquil that they seemed to be no longer part of the vegetation but of the inanimate realm. And then someone came back with some oranges, and we ate oranges. </p> <p>Then we set off down the slimy gray furrows, which they hadn&#x2019;t had time to sow; we pushed open a big wooden gate set in a mud wall, and walked up a narrow path, between hedges of prickly pears spread with dung and chilly dampness, where deadnettles, fumarias, and flowerless fleshy plants twined in profusion and sprawled under their own damp drab weight, or hid coyly in the recesses of the cactus hedge, and we climbed up the next hill. From here the village lay spread out before us. We took our positions, set up the machine gun, and were ready to start. And when the one who was bent over his equipment listening and speaking into the wireless receiver in a ceremonial singsong informed us that there was still a wait until zero hour, we each sought and found a dry place to sit or stretch out and wait quietly for things to begin. </p> <p>No one knows how to wait like soldiers. There is no time or place that soldiers are not waiting and waiting. Waiting in dug-in positions on the high ground, waiting for an attack, waiting to move on, waiting in a cease-fire; there is the ruthlessly long waiting, the nervous anxious waiting, and there is also the tedious waiting, that consumes and burns everything, without fire or smoke or purpose or anything. You find yourself a place, you lie down in it, and you wait. Where have we not lain down? </p> <p>There was a time when we had just begun to go into the villages that had been conquered, when there was still something fastidious in us, so that we would rather stand or walk the entire day, anything rather than sit on that earth, which wasn&#x2019;t the soil of fields but a putrid patch of disgusting dirt, spat upon by generations that had cast their water and excrement and the dung of their cattle and camels upon it, those dirt plots around their hovels, touched by the stench of the refuse of wretched cramped human habitation. Everything was filthy, it was disgusting to pick anything up, and already in the afternoon of the same day we were all sprawled full length upon that very sickly loathsome pissed-upon ground, lying comfortably, in a hardened mood, bursting out every now and then into eye-dimming laughter. </p> <p>Oh, those days in the dug-in positions. There was once this stocky guy, with a swarthy pockmarked face and a mop of woolly hair, who tried to amuse others by making faces, while performing appropriate contortions, dressed in a filthy undershirt, and for the thousandth time he pretended to be speaking into the wireless, transmitting repeatedly in a hoarse voice: &#x201c;Hey babe, can you hear me, can you hear me? I&#x2019;m on the hill, I&#x2019;m on the hill, at the ruins, at the ruins, I need you, I&#x2019;m waiting for you, babe, you hear me, over!&#x201d; And everyone easily took the hint and responded with an uproarious outburst that, for fear of stopping, continued longer than it should have. </p> <p>Carcasses of dogs stank and no one cared. Whole days in the desolate dust, in fetid boredom, in demoralizing danger, and in filth from which there was no escape. Lying and waiting for what would happen. Or for anything. No one was virtuous enough now to powder himself against fleas. One knelt in a shaded hollow and lay down. And as the sun revolved, you cast a reproachful eye upon it and didn&#x2019;t move a limb&#x2014;the sun could explode for all you cared and you wouldn&#x2019;t move. And when, finally, a pleasant sea breeze blew and slightly ruffled and stirred the screens of dusty filth that hung scorching and angry, a pleasant expectancy also flared up inside you, as though despite everything. Immediately the sorrowful wail dissolved within you and everyone started thinking about girls. Something about them all as they were, and something about one in particular, except that even before the wind had folded its wings, turbid powerfully rushing streams had confounded this small pleasure, until finally there was nothing left of it but a kind of foul miasma. Immediately there was a need for vengeance, breaking and smashing, at the very least trampling. They would beat the camel that was turning the creaking dripping waterwheel until their hands were raw, and kick the old Arab who had stayed behind to make sure the water was drawn, and who, out of eagerness to help and so as not to be useless, held the camel&#x2019;s halter and walked around with it, round and round for long hours, he and the camel together; they would shoot dozens of bullets at a terrified dog until it fell, and they&#x2019;d get into a murderous argument with someone, and then slip back into boredom and idleness, and vile monotonous meals, biting, chewing, hurling the tin away, kicking it to hell, and adding similar outrages, and waiting for the thing to happen, to take place at once, for something or other to happen, and damn it! </p> <p>When it was afternoon, which here was dusty, shimmering with glassy heat-haze in the distance, hinting at outlines of things that, apparently, were not from these parts, and would not reach you, boiling away with the thrill of a July day upon the spacious expanse of yellow-gray land, without a strip of shade, without any refuge, the diametrical opposite of dampness, when the dusty afternoon had boiled away in utter freedom, the hours grew longer and longer, desiccating, ending with great sadness, with a sort of nothingness that seethed up heavy and slippery, leveling everything, until everything was exactly the same, flattened and unimportant, and someone would not be able stop himself any longer and would leap up and with a shout rush down from the hill and attack someone standing by the well&#x2014;from which the creaking wheel wrung intermittent spurts, while vicious hornets pounced eagerly upon every fallen drop&#x2014;and scream repeatedly with uncontrollable fury:</p> <p>&#x201c;Jab the fucker in the backside! Get it moving! Get the bastard moving!&#x201d;</p> <p>That was what waiting had been like. But on this glorious winter morning, upon this luxuriant hill, when everything around was green and watered, it was nothing more than a picnic on a school outing, when all you had to do was be happy and celebrate the pleasant hours and then go home to your mom. We lay on our backs or on our bellies or on our sides, our legs spread out in every direction, our tongues wagging easily, chatting and chewing, everything that we had been ordered to do on this mission wasn&#x2019;t worth a thought, that village over there, the infiltrators within it, and whatever else the devil might put together here. We didn&#x2019;t owe anyone a thing, we didn&#x2019;t have to worry about a thing, and we didn&#x2019;t care about a thing. </p> <p>Apart from all sorts of other things, all this might only be one further piece of evidence that this war had gone on long enough, as was commonly agreed, in fact too long, and the time had come, perhaps, for other children to come and continue the game, if it was impossible to do without it. </p> <p>With the same ease and facility with which the prattle had sprung up previously out of the pleasantness of lying around and doing nothing it now died down quickly and stopped of its own accord&#x2014;from what we might call, for short, aridity of the heart. We sprawled in silence. We knew so well who would say what, and what would be said by whom, and also how he would twist his lips when he said what he said, and even his manner of being silent, so that you&#x2019;d rouse yourself and hurry to revive the chatter so as not to leave a silence, were it not for the laziness. Maybe that wasn&#x2019;t it, but as one lay idly about, thoughts would stealthily creep in, and we knew that when the thoughts came, troubles began; better not to start thinking. By the way, two or three of us had already, it turned out, really begun to nod off. Including one kid who had started singing a snatch of a tune under his breath for the third or fourth time, and had stopped because he didn&#x2019;t know any more or because that was all he wanted to say. Even the one who was amusing himself throwing small stones a short distance, and a moment before had begun to play the well-known game of throwing stones at his friends and feigning innocence, got bored with it, folded his hands under his head, sank back, and his gaze wandered up into the branches of the ancient jujube tree and the vast sky that swirled up directly from the summit of the green canopy and rose with a mighty rush to unfathomable heights (which he cared nothing about and paid no attention to), so much so that suddenly it was understood that it was all up with us. We would never succeed the way we once had. Once, not long ago. And something fundamentally different, and gloomy, had already been sown in our innermost being, and there was nothing to be done about it. </p> <p>If this lying around continued, I feared that we would start to quarrel. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hebrew copyright � 1949 by Noemi Smilansky and Zmora Bitan Publishers</p> <p>English translation copyright � 2008 by Nicholas de Lange and Yaacob Dweck</p> <p>Afterword copyright � 2008 by David Shulman and Ibis Editions</p></p><h2>Our Daily Bread Bible Sourcebook: The Who, What, Where, Wow Guide to the Bible</h2><p>Take the struggle out of reading and understanding the Bible with the <i>Our Daily Bread Bible Sourcebook, </i>a helpful tool that will walk you through each book of the Bible. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From Genesis to Revelation, these interesting pages will offer better context to the biblical narrative with tangible examples to answer questions like these:<br> &nbsp;<ul><li>Who wrote the 66 books of the Bible?</li><li>What is Scripture all about?</li><li>When did the biblical events take place?</li><li>Why is the Bible relevant?</li><li>How are the Bible&#x2019;s teachings applicable in today&#x2019;s culture?</li><li>What key verses are worth remembering?</li><li>Does archaeology confirm the facts of the Bible?</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><i>Our Daily Bread Bible Sourcebook </i>is an informative and entertaining resource that will give you a more complete picture of the Bible. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Experience the Bible in a whole new way! </b><br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;ve ever been overwhelmed by the Bible or wished for a resource to help guide you through each of its 66 books, this book is for you!

The Search for God in Ancient Egypt offers a distillation of Jan Assmann's views on ancient Egyptian religion, with special emphasis on theology and piety. Deeply rooted in the texts of ancient Egypt and thoroughly informed by comparative religion, theology, anthropology, and semiotic analysis, Assmann's interpretations reveal the complexity of Egyptian thought in a new way.</p><p>Assmann takes special care to distinguish between the "implicit" theology of Egyptian polytheism and the "explicit" theology that is concerned with exploring the problem of the divine. His discussion of polytheism and mythology addresses aspects of ritual, the universe, and myth; his consideration of explicit theology deals with theodicy and the specifics of Amarna religion.</p></p><p><p>Jan Assmann is Professor of Egyptology at Heidelberg University and the 1998 winner of the prestigious Deutsche Historikerpreis (German History Prize). David Lorton, an Egyptologist, has translated other Cornell books, including The Twilight of Ancient Egypt: First Millennium B.C.E. by Karol Mysliwiec and The Priests of Ancient Egypt, New Edition by Serge Sauneron.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Brother Hugo and the Bear</h2><p><i>A clever tale that will charm book lovers</i><br><br> Brother Hugo can't return his library book -- the letters of St. Augustine -- because, it turns out, the precious book has been devoured by a bear! Instructed by the abbot to borrow another monastery's copy and create a replacement, the hapless monk painstakingly crafts a new book, copying it letter by letter and line by line. But when he sets off to return the borrowed copy, he finds himself trailed by his hungry new friend. Once a bear has a taste of letters, it appears, he&#x2019;s rarely satisfied!<br><br><i>Brother Hugo and the Bear</i> is loosely based on a note found in a twelfth-century manuscript -- and largely on the creative imaginings of author Katy Beebe. Lavishly illustrated by S. D. Schindler in the style of medieval manuscripts, this humorous tale is sure to delight readers who have acquired their own taste for books.</p><p>Katy Beebe teaches history at University of Texas at Arlington and has a doctorate in Medieval History from the University of Oxford. She spent many years studying the kinds of medieval manuscripts that Brother Hugo might have made.<br><br> S.D. Schindler is an award-winning illustrator of many bestselling picture books, including&nbsp;<i>Come to the Castle!</i>&nbsp;(Flash Point),&nbsp;<i>The Story of Salt</i>&nbsp;(Putnam Juvenile), and&nbsp;<i>Big Pumpkin</i>&nbsp;(Aladdin). He lives in Pennsylvania.K-Gr 3&#x2014;According to detailed back matter, the author learned of a documented incident involving a book-eating bear and the subsequent letter written by Peter the Venerable to a neighboring French monastery requesting St. Augustine's letters. That research inspired this story that combines suspense, humor, and information in a handsome, entertaining package. As the tale begins, Brother Hugo confesses his unfortunate loss to the abbot, who asks: "Pray tell, ... how did a bear find our letters of St. Augustine?" Hugo replies ruefully, "They seemed to agree with him." His penance is to journey to Chartreuse to borrow the manuscript and copy it. Beebe's language creates an Old World flavor, as Hugo "sorely sighed and sorrowed in his heart" and "sped full mightily." When he begins to copy the borrowed book, the enormity of the task dawns on him, and the brothers offer assistance. Readers then obtain a clear overview of medieval bookmaking, from the stretching and scraping of sheepskin to the laborious copying and binding. Schindler's elegant compositions make full use of each spread. Text wraps around delicate ink and watercolor brooks and grazing sheep, while illuminated letters decorate and amuse. Arches and columns cleverly frame the monk, creating sequential panels to portray his painstaking progress on what becomes, alas, another "choice morsel" for the insatiable beast. Combine this with C. M. Millen's The Ink Garden of Brother Theophane (Charlesbridge, 2010) and Jan Pancheri's Brother William's Year (Frances Lincoln, 2010) for further insights into how monasteries nourish bodies and souls.&#x2014;Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library</p><h2>The Practitioner&#39;s Guide to Governance as Leadership: Building High-Performing Nonprofit Boards</h2><p><p><b>THE PRACTITIONER'S GUIDE TO GOVERNANCE <i>AS</i> LEADERSHIP</b> </p><p><i>The Practitioner's Guide to Governance as Leadership</i> offers a resource that shows how to achieve excellence and peak performance in the boardroom by putting into practice the groundbreaking model that was introduced in the book, Governance as Leadership.

In Maggie Bonanomi's world, hand-drawn patterns and hand-dyed wool combine with artful motifs and casual stitches. The result is a plain-and-simple collection of primitive projects that are a delight to make, use, and enjoy.<br>No fancy skills to learn, no expensive tools to buy: a needle, thread, and wool are all you need to begin. Create pillows, runners and toppers, wall art, and even clever vegetables crafted into sewing essentials, including a pincushion and scissors keeper--make them in minutes to warm up any nook or cranny.</p></p><p>I woke up and immediately found myself in a contemplative state, pondering my numerous blessings, sending prayers to friends who are going through an arduous journey of sickness, and getting energized for my day. In the end, I realized as the beautiful artwork above depicts, that life is really good. And so, I give thanks for the many freedoms I enjoy, to the opportunity to learn new things (I am a learning junky), and for being able to use my talents in the service of the highest good. Designing, making, selling handmade things, giving handmade gifts are all noble ways to use our creative talents to bring happiness to others. As we create, we seem to be gathering all the abundance from the universe and packaging it into a vessel - a pincushion, a quilt pattern, a quilt, an embroidered something - to deliver it back to the universe in a new form, though its substance is still the same: love. Maggie Bonanomi, the creator of the projects in Pure &amp; Simple, has the gift to find the love, the simplicity, and the beauty in the simplest things around us and turn them into woolen projects we can enjoy making, displaying in our homes, or gifting. Maggie s book has fun projects which do not require advanced skills: take wool and thread and begin creating. Her designs aren't elaborate, allowing colors and textures to show through. In no time at all, we can have a project done thanks to her patterns' clear instructions, the ready availability of the materials, and the tips she gives us throughout the book. I have a thing for strawberries and this one is so darn cute! Many primitive designs involve dark materials - not in Maggie's work: her primitive creations are sunny and fresh, preserving the basic characteristics of each object of her inspiration, yet infusing it with just enough whimsy as if to say: "This is how I see the strawberry's or watermelon's sweetness - pure and simple." I am in a frenzy to finish patterns and quilts before I go visit my Mom in Brazil next week. Maggie's Pure &amp; Simple - 17 Primitive Projects Inspired by the Seasons reminded me to pace myself, to not go an hour without noticing the magic of everything around me, and to make time to create without the pressure of a deadline. And for this reminder, I am thankful. Such is the effect of our creations on others. --Pieced Brain Quilt Designs</p><h2>My Father's Glory &amp; My Mother's Castle: Marcel Pagnol's Memories of Childhood</h2><p><p>Bathed in the warm clarity of the summer sun in Provence, Marcel Pagnol's childhood memories celebrate a time of rare beauty and delight.Called by Jean Renoir "the leading film artist of his age," Pagnol is best known for such films as The Baker's Wife, Harvest, Fanny, and Topaze, as well as the screen adaptations of his novels Jean de Florette and Manon of the Springs (North Point, 1988). But he never forgot the magic of his Provencal childhood, and when he set his memories to paper late in life the result was a great new success. <i> My Father's Glory and My Mother's Castle</i> appeared on the scene like a fresh breeze, captivating readers with its sweet enchantments. Pagnol recalls his days hunting and fishing in the hill country, his jaunts about Marseilles, his schoolboy diversions, and above all his family: his anticlerical father and sanctimonious uncle, his mild and beautiful mother, and many others. This bright and lively book sparkles with the charm and magic that were Marcel Pagnol's own.</p></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)<p>&#x201c;Pagnol lived what he made movies and wrote about.... More than just the reminiscences of a happy childhood, these pages resonate with the inspirational qualities of all Pagnol's work: the good humor, the love of nature, the sensuality, and the strong feeling for family and tradition.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alice Waters</i></p><p>&#x201c;Marcel Pagnol has taught me a great deal more than anyone would guess.

First published in Hanoi during 1936, it follows the absurd and unexpected rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named Red-haired Xuan. As it charts Xuan's fantastic social ascent, the novel provides a panoramic view of late colonial urban social order, from the filthy sidewalks of Hanoi's old commercial quarter to the gaudy mansions of the emergent Francophile northern upper classes. The transformation of traditional Vietnamese class and gender relations triggered by the growth of colonial capitalism represents a major theme of the novel.<br></p> <p><i>Dumb Luck</i> is the first translation of a major work by Vu Trong Phung, arguably the greatest Vietnamese writer of the twentieth century.

[Newman&#x2019;s] surprisingly convincing thesis is that the sartorial choices authors make are deeply connected to the narrative choices they make &#x2014; or, as Beckett put it, &#x2018;the fabric of language&#x2019; they use.&#x201d; -Vanessa Friedman, <em>The New York Times</em></p><p>Discover the signature sartorial and literary style of fifty men and women of letters, including Maya Angelou; Truman Capote; Colette; Bret Easton Ellis; Allen Ginsberg; Patti Smith; Karl Ove Knausgaard; and David Foster Wallace; in this unique compendium of profiles&#x2014;packed with eighty black-and-white photographs, excerpts, quotes, and fast facts&#x2014;that illuminates their impact on modern fashion.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s Zadie Smith&#x2019;s exotic turban, James Joyce&#x2019;s wire-framed glasses, or Samuel Beckett&#x2019;s Wallabees, a writer&#x2019;s attire often reflects the creative and spiritual essence of his or her work. As a non-linear sensibility has come to dominate modern style, curious trendsetters have increasingly found a stimulating muse in writers&#x2014;many, like Joan Didion, whose personal aesthetic is distinctly "out of fashion." For decades, Didion has used her work, both her journalism and experimental fiction, as a mirror to reflect her innermost emotions and ideas&#x2014;an originality that has inspired Millennials, resonated with a new generation of fashion designers and cultural tastemakers, and made Didion, in her eighties, the face of Celine in 2015. </p><p><em>Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore</em> examines fifty revered writers&#x2014;among them Samuel Beckett; Quentin Crisp; Simone de Beauvoir; T.S.

A middle-aged bachelor, he has no interest in anything beyond the certificates of birth, marriage, divorce, and death that are his daily routine. But one day, when he comes across the records of an anonymous young woman, something happens to him. Obsessed, Senhor Jos� sets off to follow the thread that may lead him to the woman-but as he gets closer, he discovers more about her, and about himself, than he would ever have wished.<br><br>The loneliness of people's lives, the effects of chance, the discovery of love-all coalesce in this extraordinary novel that displays the power and art of Jos� Saramago in brilliant form.<br> <br></p><p>"As soon as you cross the threshold, you notice the smell of old paper." The Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths is the setting for <i>All the Names</i>, Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese author Jos� Saramago's seventh novel to be translated into English. The names in question are those of every man, woman, and child ever born, married, or buried in the unnamed city where the Registry is located, and are the special province of Senhor Jos� who is employed there as a clerk. Over the centuries, the paper trail in this hopelessly arcane bureaucracy has grown so monumental, so disorganized that <blockquote> one poor researcher became lost in the labyrinthine catacombs of the archive of the dead, having come to the Central Registry in order to carry out some genealogical research he had been commissioned to undertake. He was discovered, almost miraculously, after a week, starving, thirsty, exhausted, delirious, having survived thanks to the desperate measure of ingesting enormous quantities of old documents that neither lingered in the stomach nor nourished, since they melted in the mouth without requiring any chewing. </blockquote> The nondescript Senhor Jos� labors long and thanklessly among the archives; his is a tepid, lonely life with only one small hobby to leaven his leisure hours: he collects "news items about those people in his country who, for good reasons and bad, had become famous." One night, it occurs to him that "something fundamental was missing from his collection, that is, the origin, the root, the source, in other words, the actual birth certificate of these famous people"--and that the information is within easy reach on the other side of a connecting door that separates his meager lodgings from the Registry itself. And so begins Senhor Jos�'s midnight raids on the stacks as he shuttles between the Registry and his own room bearing precious records that he carefully copies before returning them to their rightful places. Still, this minor aberration might have remained the clerk's only transgression if not for a simple act of fate: one night, along with his celebrity records, he accidentally picks up a birth certificate belonging to an ordinary, unknown woman--a woman who becomes suddenly more important than all the others precisely because she <i>is</i> unknown. Celebrity is cast aside as Senhor Jos� begins a search for this mysterious quarry--a quest that will lead him into conflict with his superior, the Registrar, and ensnare him in the kind of messy personal histories and tangled relationships he has thus far avoided in his own life. <p> A recurring theme in many of Saramago's novels is the very human struggle between withdrawal and connection. Whether it is the Iberian peninsula literally breaking off from the rest of Europe in <i>The Stone Raft</i> or an entire country afflicted by a devastating malady in <i>Blindness</i>, he is fascinated by the effects of isolation on the human soul and, correspondingly, the redemptive power of compassion. <i>All the Names</i> continues to mine this rich vein as the repressed clerk follows his unknown Ariadne's thread out of the labyrinth of his own strangled psyche and into life. Readers will find here Saramago's trademark love of the absurd, his brilliant imagery and idiosyncratic punctuation, as well as the unflinching yet tender honesty with which he chronicles the human condition. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-100421-8<br></p><h2>The Inner Life</h2><p>The Indian Sufi master Hazrat Inayat Khan (1882 1927) was the first teacher to bring Sufism&#x2014;Islamic mysticism&#x2014;to the Western world.

Hardy never knew that Abe had a daughter-until she was shot dead. It seems obvious that the heroin addict hovering over her body with a gun is the guilty party, and Glitsky has few qualms about sweating a confession out of him. But there is more to this murder-much more. And as both Hardy and Glitsky risk their lives to uncover the truth, others are working hard to stop them.</p><p>When the police find Cole Burgess crouched over Elaine Wager's body on a deserted San Francisco street, they don't have to look very far for means, motive, and the assumption of guilt. The heroin junkie is carrying the gun that killed the rising political star, he has her jewelry and wallet in his pockets, and he flees as fast as his smacked- out legs will take him--right into a fire hydrant. But homicide lieutenant Abe Glitsky isn't willing to leave anything to chance. Elaine was his daughter, though neither had ever acknowledged the relationship. Desperate to avenge his daughter's murder, the policeman (whose razor-sharp profile mirrors an even edgier personality) encourages his detectives to "sweat" the suspect for a confession. <p> The DA is equally eager to capitalize (pun intended) on the murder: bent on reversing her public image as being soft on crime, Sharron Pratt declares that her office will seek the death penalty. Enter Dismas Hardy, author John Lescroart's smooth-talking Irish lawyer, cajoled into defending Burgess. He doesn't like his client, but he doesn't trust the confession nor Pratt's sudden blood thirst. Joining investigative forces with Elaine's paralegal, Treya Ghent, and Glitsky himself suspended after news of the confession leaks out, Hardy will find himself on the trail of corruption and deceit in the most rarefied of legal circles. </p><p> <i>The Hearing</i> is a big, burly legal thriller, and its size is both vice and virtue. Lescroart handles his courtroom scenes with a deft touch, but his <i>ex judicia</i> narrative is often ponderous. He tends to introduce plot developments with sweeping statements, bolstering them with clumsy retrospection, and his characterization leaves something to be desired: "the very cute Amy Wu" has "large enough breasts so that people rarely noticed the bit of thickness at her waist"; and "Visser had a couple of character flaws that were going to negatively impact his aspirations on the force." These cavils aside, <i>The Hearing</i> will doubtlessly appeal to Grisham and Turow fans-- and to Lescroart's own considerable retinue. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>John Lescroart is the author of nineteen previous novels, including <i>The Betrayal, The Suspect, The Hunt Club, The Motive, The Second Chair, The First Law, The Oath, The Hearing</i>, and <i>Nothing But the Truth</i>.

Now you can investigate ancient European Shamanic traditions &#x2014; including your heritage, perhaps &#x2014; that were destroyed during the Burning Times. <br> <br>Another unique feature of this book is that for each animal Conway has included a special "power chant" to invoke that animal's natural and magickal attributes. This way, even if you are not meditating, doing a ritual, or going on a shamanic journey to the "otherworld," you can still call on your familiars to bring you the help and confidence you need. <br> <br><i>Animal Magick</i> shows you a powerful path to a more creative, more secure future.

With refreshingly open-minded curiosity, William Dalrymple explores the seven "dead" cities of Delhi as well as the eighth city&#x2014;today's Delhi. Underlying his quest is the legend of the djinns, fire-formed spirits that are said to assure the city's Phoenix-like regeneration no matter how many times it is destroyed. Entertaining, fascinating, and informative, <b>City of Djinns</b> is an irresistible blend of research and adventure.</p><p>William Dalrymple was born in Scotland and brought up on the shores of the Firth of Forth. He wrote the highly acclaimed bestseller<b>&nbsp;In Xanadu</b>&nbsp;when he was twenty-two. The book won the 1990 Yorkshire Post Best First Work Award and a Scottish Arts Council Spring Book Award; it was also shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize. In 1989 Dalrymple moved to Delhi where he lived for six years researching his second book, <b>City of Djinns</b>, which won the 1994 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award and the Sunday Times Young British Writer of the Year Award. <b>From the Holy Mountain</b>, his acclaimed study of the demise of Christianity in its Middle Eastern homeland, was awarded the Scottish Arts Council Autumn Book Award for 1997; it was also shortlisted for the 1998 Thomas Cook Award, the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize.

His Radio 4 series on the history of British spirituality and mysticism, <b>The Long Search</b>, recent won the 2002 Sandford St Martin Prize for Religious Broadcasting and was described by the judges as 'thrilling in its brilliance... near perfect radio.'<b><b>He is married to the artist Olivia Fraser, and they have three children. They now divide their time between London and Delhi.</b></b></p>Delhi has a richly layered past, and Dalrymple (In Xanadu, McKay, 1990) deftly peels away each layer to reveal how the city came to be what it is today. Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text. Considering the importance of Delhi, the capital of the world's second most populous nation, this book deserves to be in most public and academic libraries.<br><i>Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll. Lib., Ashland</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Esoteric Psychology, Vol. 1: A Treatise on the Seven Rays</h2><p><p>Five volumes have been written under the overall title of "A Treatise on the Seven Rays". This sequence of books is based on the fact, the nature and the quality of the seven basic streams of energy pervading our solar system, our planet and all that lives and moves within its orbit. Of the specialised subjects presented in these books, two volumes are concerned with esoteric psychology--the first in relation to basic energy patterns and structures; the second particularly applied to the soul and the personality of man and to the working out of the Plan for humanity. </p><p>Psychology is defined in Webster's Dictionary as "the science of mind", at one time considered a branch of metaphysics. Today we are more inclined to include all the conditioning subjective factors as psychological in nature--mental and emotional impulses and soul contact, to whatever degree it exists. These subjective influences constitute the whole psychological background to a man's attitudes and behaviour, and create the faculty of spiritual response. </p><p>The "psyche" is, after all, the human soul, the centre of consciousness. Esoteric psychology begins with a consideration of the human being as a soul, manifesting in the form of a personality, consisting of mental, emotional and etheric/physical substance, and more or less in contact and control, depending on the stage of evolution in the personality consciousness. </p><p>From the point of view of esoteric psychology, evolution is the evolution of consciousness, by which the imbedded fragment of the soul within the personality progressively identifies its spiritual source and becomes at-one with it. </p><p>The seven differentiated streams of ray energy play a significant role in this evolutionary process. A blend of five energies in a human being determine his goals, his problems, his available qualities and energy resources, and the correct method by which--according to his dominant ray influence--he may unfold his consciousness and make spiritual progress. </p><p>In this volume of Esoteric Psychology many of these distinctive ray qualities and methods are given as quotations, or interpretations, of "The Old Commentary" put into poetic and symbolic words. The seven rays are shown as the Seven Creative Builders, each one imbued with purpose and power, functioning together as a synthesis in occult obedience to the purposes of our Solar Logos. </p><p> Such a detailed and comprehensive study of the ray energies influencing our planetary life and all kingdoms in nature is of inestimable value to the aspirant consciously preparing himself to become of planetary service as he learns to serve and to unite with his fellowmen. </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime</p><h2>Anxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief: A Revolutionary Approach to Understanding and Healing the Impact of Loss</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking book exploring the little-known yet critical connections between anxiety and grief, with practical strategies for healing, following the renowned K�bler-Ross stages model<br><br></b>If you're suffering form anxiety but not sure why, or if you're struggling with loss and looking for solace, <i>Anxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief </i>offers help -- and answers.

Now, using research and real life stories, Smith breaks down the physiology of anxiety, giving you a concrete foundation of understanding in order to help you heal. Starting with the basics of What Is Anxiety? and What Is Grief? and moving to concrete approaches such as Making Amends, Taking Charge, and Retraining Your Brain, <i>Anxiety </i>takes a big step beyond Elisabeth K�bler-Ross's widely accepted five stages to unpack everything from our age-old fears about mortality to the bare vulnerability a loss can make us feel.<br><br>With concrete tools and coping strategies for panic attacks, getting a handle on anxious thoughts, and more, Smith bridges these two emotions in a way that is deeply empathetic and eminently practical.<br></p><p><b>Claire Bidwell Smith, LCPC</b>, is a therapist specializing in grief and the author of two books of nonfiction.

Planting prairie on just 10 percent of a field can effectively remove excess phosphorous and nitrogen from the remaining 90 percent. Deep prairie roots and dense aboveground growth filter and hold soils, keeping them from eroding into our streams and rivers. Plants such as common milkweed are the key to the monarch butterfly&#x2019;s recovery. In light of these benefits, perhaps our love affair with European turf grass is slowly giving way to an appreciation of the beauty of our original native prairie.<br><br> As interest in these wildflowers and grasses has grown, so has demand for better resources to identify the hundreds of species that make up the native prairie. In <i>The Prairie in Seed</i>, Dave Williams shows us how to identify wildflowers when they are out of bloom and, in particular, how to harvest their seeds. Without the flower color and shape as guides, it can be difficult to identify prairie plants. Imagine trying to distinguish between a simple prairie sunflower and an ox-eye sunflower with no flowers to look at!<br><br> In this richly illustrated guide, Williams offers dormant plant identification information, seed descriptions, and advice on seed harvesting and cleaning for seventy-three of the most common wildflowers found in the tallgrass prairie. He includes photographs and descriptions of the plants in bloom and in seed to assist in finding them when you are ready to harvest. Each species description explains where the seeds are located on the plant, when seed ripening begins, and how many seeds each species produces, along with a photograph and approximate measurements of the actual seed. Finally, this guide provides assistance on how and when to hand-harvest seeds for each species, as well as some simple tips on seed cleaning.<br><br> An indispensable guide for anyone involved in prairie restoration or conservation, this book is the perfect complement to Williams&#x2019;s <i>The Tallgrass Prairie Center Guide to Seed and Seedling Identification in the Upper Midwest</i>.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Dave Williams </b>is the program manager for the Prairie Institute at the Tallgrass Prairie Center at the University of Northern Iowa and the author of <i>The Tallgrass Prairie Center Guide to Seed and Seedling Identification in the Upper Midwest </i>(Iowa, 2010).

Or in trying to do so, is an external grid being unnaturallysuperimposed on the biblical text?These are difficult questions that the discipline of biblical theology has struggled to answer.In this thoroughly revised and expanded edition of his classic Toward an Old Testament Theology,Walter Kaiser offers a solution to these unresolved issues. He proposes that there is indeeda unifying center to the theology and message of the Bible that is indicated and affirmed byScripture itself. That center is the promise of God. It is one all-encompassing promise of lifethrough the Messiah that winds itself throughout salvation history in both the Old and NewTestaments, giving cohesiveness and unity to the various parts of Scripture.After laying out his proposal, Kaiser works chronologically through the books of both testaments,demonstrating how the promise is seen throughout, how the various sub-themesof each book relate to the promise, and how God&#x2019;s plan to fulfill the promise progressivelyunfolds.

The present volume, by a noted scholar, calligrapher, and artist, was the first significant treatment of the topic and remains among the foremost works devoted to the history, aesthetics, and techniques of the brush &#x2015; the single most important tool in Chinese fine art. <br>The author begins by tracing the historical development of techniques and styles evolved by Chinese masters from the 14th century B.C. to the present. An in-depth explanation of Chinese aesthetic concepts and criteria follows, enhanced by the author's perceptive personal insights in such matters as line, form, space consciousness, and composition. A final section provides a valuable introduction to the materials, technical principles, and major brush strokes of Chinese painting and calligraphy. Techniques are demonstrated in numerous illustrations, including examples of the author's own highly respected work and painting and calligraphy from ancient and modern times. <br>Also included among more than 200 illustrations and photographs are a map of ancient China, chronological charts of calligraphic styles and dominant painting subjects, as well as a glossary of major terms in English and Chinese. <br>Dr. Kwo has exhibited his paintings at museums and art galleries throughout the world and has taught Chinese brushwork extensively in colleges&nbsp;and universities in both China and the United States.

But when Jewish producers in Hollywood made his 1932 novel, <i>Little Man, What Now? </i>into a major motion picture, the rising Nazis began to take note of him. His struggles increased after he refused to join the Party and was denounced by neighbors for &#x201c;anti-Nazi&#x201d; sympathies. Unlike many other prominent artists, however, Fallada decided not to flee Germany. By the end of World War II he&#x2019;d suffered an alcohol-fueled nervous breakdown and was in a Nazi insane asylum, where he nonetheless managed to write&#x2014;in code&#x2014;the brilliant subversive novel, <i>The Drinker</i>. After the war, Fallada went on to write <i>Every Man Dies Alone</i>, based on an actual Gestapo file, but he died in 1947 of a morphine overdose, just before it was published."The ideal summer read." <br><b>&#x2014;Katherine Powers,&nbsp;<i>The Boston Globe&nbsp;</i></b><br>&nbsp; <br>"An unmissably brilliant portrait of Berlin before the Nazis." <br><b><i>&#x2014;The Times of London</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Outstanding... his novels, whatever their ultimate position in the literary rankings, are simply much more entertaining than the tomes produced by the usual German suspects, Mann, Hesse, Grass, B�ll....if you fancy a book to take you right through your holidays and any possible delays at the airport, you couldn&#x2019;t do better than <i>Wolf Among Wolves</i>.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Tibor Fischer,&nbsp;<i>Telegraph</i>&nbsp;(UK)</b><br>&nbsp; <br>"His most ambitious novel... deeply moving... he has evoked more than one can bear, but not more than it is necessary to learn, to keep and to understand." <br><b>&#x2014;Alfred Kazin,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i>(1938)<i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&nbsp; <br>"Fallada handles [the characters] not morbidly but with a Hogarthian exuberance and a tough humor, infusing into even those dying spirits the life of his copious imagination...

She loves going on adventures, spending time with her family, and hiking with her dog, Cleo. The idea for <i>Chicken, Chicken, Duck!</i> came to her as a chant as she walked along rural country roads, past farms with llamas, cows, and sheep.&nbsp; "The words sounded like the game 'Duck, Duck, Goose,' minus the goose but with some chickens," she says. This is Nadia's second book for children.<b>Review, Publishers Weekly, January 10, 2011:</b><br>"...a thing of beauty..."<br><br><b>Review, SanFranciscoBookReview.com, June 11, 2011</b><br>"...a perfect book for very young toddlers."</p><h2>Knit One Knit All</h2><p>One of Elizabeth Zimmermann&#39;s dreams was to publish a book of her garter stitch designs. Though she proffered the idea to her primary publisher, and though the idea floated around their office for years, ultimately the project was not undertaken. In one of the publisher&#39;s letters that seemed promising, Elizabeth had written an exclamation of joy in the margins, and it seems fitting to us to fulfill her wish for a garter stitch book. As we looked through Elizabeth&#39;s designs, we found a wealth of material, much of it little known or unknown to knitters. Further, we were intrigued and excited by the unique construction of some of these &#34;new&#34;; designs (equal to her classic baby surprise jacket). You will find sweaters, coats, jackets, and vests for adults and kids, baby garments, plus a wonderful array of small projects including sideways gloves and socks, several brimmed hats, an ingenius pattern for knitted clogs and more.</p><p>Elizabeth Zimmermann was a British-born masterknitter who, after immigrating to the United States, wanted to supply handknitters with pure wool and circular needles (both a rarity in those days), as well as books, tools, and original designs. Elizabeth&#39;s humor and unique approach to seamless garment construction gradually attracted followers through her semi-annual Newsletter, a steady stream of designs in magazines, two television series taped for PBS-TV, the annual summer Knitting Camp and publication of her books, Knitting Without Tears, Knitting Around, Elizabeth Zimmermann&#39;s Knitting Workshop, Knitter&#39;s Almanac (now in two editions). The book The Opinionated Knitter was published posthumously, as was Knit One Knit All. Elizabeth&#39;s philosophy was received with glad cries by knitters who were eager to think for themselves and, through EPS (Elizabeth&#39;s Percentage System) were able to achieve perfectly-fitted garments while applying their own ideas to their knitting.</p><h2>The Nature and Mission of Theology: Approaches to Understanding Its Role in the Light of Present Controversy</h2><p>Cardinal Ratzinger wrote this book in response to the dialogue going on today concerning theology and the clarification of its methods, its mission and its limits which he thinks has become urgent. Ratzinger states: &#34;To do theology-as the Magisterium understands theology-it is not sufficient merely to calculate how much religion can reasonably be expected of man and to utilize bits and pieces of the Christian tradition accordingly. Theology is born when the arbitrary judgment of reason encounters a limit, in that we discover something which we have not excogitated ourselves but which has been revealed to us. For this reason, not every religious theory has the right to label itself as Christian or Catholic theology simply because it wishes to do so; whoever would lay claim to this title is obligated to accept as meaningful the prior given which goes along with it.&#34;</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>In the Shadow of Liberty: The Hidden History of Slavery, Four Presidents, and Five Black Lives</h2><p><p>Did you know that many of America&#x2019;s Founding Fathers&#x2015;who fought for liberty and justice for all&#x2015;were slave owners? </p><p>Through the powerful stories of five enslaved people who were &#x201c;owned&#x201d; by four of our greatest presidents, this book helps set the record straight about the role slavery played in the founding of America.

Emerging in England in the 1650s as a radical sect challenging the status quo, the Quakers are now best known for their anti-slavery activities, their principled stance against war, and their pioneering work in penal reform. Famous Quakers include Thomas Paine, Walt Whitman, Lucretia Mott, Herbert Hoover, James Dean, Judi Dench, and A.S. Byatt. And while the group still maintains a distinctive worship method to achieve a direct encounter with God, which has been at the heart of the movement since its beginning, Quakers today are highly diverse: some practice a protestant evangelicalism, others are no longer Christian. In this generously illustrated book, Pink Dandelion, the leading expert on Quaker Studies, draws on the latest scholarship to chart the history of the sect and its present-day diversity around the world, exploring its unique approach to worship, belief, theology and language, and ecumenism. It concludes by placing the Quakers in the wider religious picture and predicting its future.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, and Literary Theory to History.

One of the great Stoic philosophers, Seneca here guides Lucilius' struggle to achieve wisdom and serenity, uninfluenced by worldly emotions. He advises his friend on how to do without what is superfluous, whether in terms of happiness, riches, reputation, or the emotions. The letters include literary discussions, moral exhortation, exemplary heroes and episodes from Roman history, and a lurid picture of contemporary luxury. And under Nero's chaotic reign, the topic of death is never far away. This marvelous new translation by eminent scholar Elaine Fantham offers the largest selection of Seneca's letters currently available. Fantham's invaluable introduction discusses Seneca's family and political career, his many and varied writings, the nature of the letters as genuine epistles or fiction, their philosophical concerns, and other social and cultural aspects. Short head-notes to each letter summarize its themes and parallels with other letters, opening a window on to Seneca's world.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Sebestyen traces the story from Lenin's early years to his long exile in Europe and return to Petrograd in 1917 to lead the first Communist revolution in history. Uniquely, Sebestyen has discovered that throughout Lenin's life his closest relationships were with his mother, his sisters, his wife, and his mistress. The long-suppressed story told here of the love triangle that Lenin had with his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and his beautiful, married mistress and comrade, Inessa Armand, reveals a more complicated character than that of the coldly one-dimensional leader of the Bolshevik Revolution.<br><br>With Lenin's personal papers and those of other leading political figures now available, Sebestyen gives is new details that bring to life the dramatic and gripping story of how Lenin seized power in a coup and ran his revolutionary state. The product of a violent, tyrannical, and corrupt Russia, he chillingly authorized the deaths of thousands of people and created a system based on the idea that political terror against opponents was justified for a greater ideal. An old comrade what had once admired him said that Lenin "desired the good .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but created evil." This included his invention of Stalin, who would take Lenin's system of the gulag and the secret police to horrifying new heights.<br><br>In <i>Lenin, </i>Victor Sebestyen has written a brilliant portrait of this dictator as a complex and ruthless figure, and he also brings to light important new revelations about the Russian Revolution, a pivotal point in modern history.<br><i>(With 16 pages of black-and-white photographs)</i></p><p><b>VICTOR SEBESTYEN&nbsp;</b>was born in Budapest. He has worked as a journalist on many British newspapers including&nbsp;<i>The Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Daily Mail</i>, and the<i>&nbsp;London Evening Standard,&nbsp;</i>where&nbsp;he&nbsp;was&nbsp;foreign editor and&nbsp;editorial writer. He has also written for many American publications, including <i>The New York Times, </i>and was an editor at <i>Newsweek. </i>He is author of<i> Twelve Days: The Story of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire, </i>and <i>1946: The Making of the Modern World.</i>1<br><br>A Nest of Gentlefolk<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry about Lenin. The man is not dangerous.&#x2019; <br><br>Prince Georgy Lvov, the first post-imperial Prime Minister of Russia<br><br>All of the most important relationships in Lenin&#x2019;s life were with women. He had very few close male friends and nearly without exception he lost those he made, or they fell by the wayside, because of politics. Men had to agree with him wholesale and bend to his will or be dropped from his inner circle. As a confidant for many years in exile recalled: &#x2018;I began to separate myself from the revolutionary movement . . . and thus completely ceased to exist for Vladimir Ilyich.&#x2019; By the time he was thirty-three the only man he addressed by the intimate Russian &#x2018;ty&#x2019; rather than the formal &#x2018;vy&#x2019; was his younger brother Dmitry. <br><br>For most of his life Lenin was surrounded by women &#x2013; his mother, sisters, his wife of a quarter of a century, Nadya; and his mistress Inessa Armand, with whom he had a complex romantic attachment, as well as a close working relationship, that waxed and waned in intensity over many years. During a decade and a half of exile, in various cramped lodging houses throughout Europe, he lived in easy, friendly familiarity with his mother-in-law, a woman of strong opinions that differed markedly from his own. <br><br>Invariably, Lenin&#x2019;s women have been dismissed as mere drudges who performed domestic chores for him or were allowed to handle relatively simple and mundane political tasks. This is misleading. Lenin had more progressive and advanced views about the role of women than most of his male contemporaries in the revolutionary movement &#x2013; though it is true that this does not set the bar particularly high. <br><br>In many ways, Lenin the great radical was a conventional Russian bourgeois man of the late nineteenth century: hardly a feminist in the modern sense of the term. He expected the women close to him to cosset him, fuss over him and look after him, which they did. But he listened to them and took them as seriously in political matters as he did men. <br><br>His wife, Nadya, is frequently portrayed as little more than his secretary, an amanuensis with no opinions of her own. Yet there was much more to her than that. She was a revolutionary when she met him, had been jailed and exiled to Siberia before she married him, and she played a vital role alongside him in the underground conspiratorial network that kept the flame of revolution alive in Russia before 1917. She wrote no works on Marxism or philosophy, seldom spoke up about political tactics or policy, and rarely contradicted him, but Lenin relied on her practical skills and sound judgement. She &#x2018;ran&#x2019; dozens of secret Bolshevik agents throughout the Russian empire and knew every aspect of the Party organisation. Most importantly, Nadya kept her husband&#x2019;s temper and fast-changing moods in check, which often demanded immense tact. <br><br>Inessa Armand was another woman whose role in his life has been misunderstood, or &#x2013; in the case of the Soviet authorities after Lenin&#x2019;s death &#x2013; deliberately ignored. For ten years until she died in 1920 they had an on-off love affair. Armand was central to his emotional life. She was also among the best-known women socialists of her generation, one of Lenin&#x2019;s closest aides, trusted to perform the most confidential tasks. Often she represented him at international gatherings of revolutionaries, a responsibility he delegated to very few people. She held positions by Lenin&#x2019;s side in Moscow after the Revolution. Frequently she disagreed with him and plainly told him so, yet they remained inseparable. Everyone who knew her &#x2013; including Lenin&#x2019;s wife, who became her close friend in a curiously touching and devoted triangular relationship &#x2013; understood how important she was to him. Yet after he died a &#x2018;cult&#x2019; of Lenin was developed by his successors which encouraged worship of him as a secular icon representing the pillar of Bolshevik rectitude and she was all but written out of Soviet history books. In the five years before 1917 he wrote many more letters to Inessa Armand &#x2013; on personal and political matters &#x2013; than to anyone else. Their correspondence and her diaries were censored for nearly seventy years until the Communist state that Lenin founded collapsed. <br><br>Two of Lenin&#x2019;s sisters survived past their teens and worked with him closely in the revolutionary underground. Anna Ilyinichna Ulyanova, born in 1864, was his elder by six years; Maria was eight years younger than he. Both were repeatedly jailed or exiled during the Tsarist regime for subversive activities; they helped to smuggle underground agents and socialist literature into and out of Russia. After the Revolution they held responsible jobs in the Soviet regime. For many years in exile in Europe, one or both of them &#x2013; usually Maria &#x2013; shared his home, with Nadya and his mother-in-law.<br><br>Throughout his life Lenin relied on a network of devoted women totally loyal to him &#x2013; and, most of them, to his revolutionary cause. They made great sacrifices for his career and at times took enormous personal risks on his behalf: Revolution was a dangerous business. He could, and sometimes did, take their faith in him for granted. But the commitments went both ways. <br><br>Many ruthless and cynical men are sentimental about their mothers. Lenin used to say frequently to family and comrades, &#x2018;Mother . . . well, quite simply, she&#x2019;s a saint.&#x2019; He saw her rarely for the last twenty years of her life &#x2013; she died in 1916, while he was in Swiss exile &#x2013; but he was a devoted, not merely a dutiful, correspondent. Wherever he was on his wanderings about Europe he wrote to her regularly. The letters were rarely about politics or his literary/journalistic work, but he reported, often in minute detail, on his domestic arrangements, his health and his travels. Many are of a &#x2018;nature notes&#x2019; type about his hunting trips or excursions in the Alps, one of his great passions being walking in mountains and the untamed countryside. His letters home are invariably addressed to &#x2018;Darling Mother&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mamoushka Dearest&#x2019;. His last, a few weeks before her death, ends: &#x2018;I embrace you warmly my dearest and wish you vigour.&#x2019; Lenin was petulant, ill-tempered and irascible, especially as he grew older, but his mother was the one person he never complained about to anybody, the only one to whom he always showed unqualified love.<br><br>Maria Alexandrovna Blank was born in 1835 in St Petersburg. Her father was an eccentric, a martinet and &#x2013; a fact kept strictly secret by the Soviet authorities after Lenin&#x2019;s death &#x2013; a Jew. He had been born Sril (the Yiddish form of Israel) Moiseyevich (Moses) Blank in Odessa, but while studying medicine he converted to Orthodoxy and changed his first name and patronymic to Alexander Dmitriyevich. He travelled widely in Europe after qualifying as a doctor and married the daughter of a wealthy German merchant, Anna Groschopf. She was a Protestant. Under the restrictive religious laws of Tsarist Russia, his wife was required to convert to the Orthodox faith, but she refused and brought up her six children as Lutherans.<br><br>Alexander Blank began as an army surgeon, later became a police doctor and, finally, an inspector of hospitals at Zlatoust, in the vast province of Chelyabinsk in western Siberia. This gave him the civil service rank of &#x2018;state councillor&#x2019;, which entitled him to claim noble status. When he retired in his fifties he registered as a member of the nobility of Kazan and he bought an estate, Kokushkino, about thirty kilometres north-east of the city, with a fine manor house and forty serfs who worked the land. <br><br>Maria Alexandrovna&#x2019;s mother died when she was three. Her father began living with his late wife&#x2019;s sister, Ekaterina von Essen, herself widowed. It was a shocking m�nage for those days and Blank wanted to make an honest woman of his sister-in-law. He tried to marry her, but the marriage was illegal in the eyes of the Church and the couple were refused permission. Her money helped to buy the Kokushkino estate and they remained together until she died in 1863.<br><br>A quiet, strong-willed, introverted woman, Lenin&#x2019;s mother had dark-brown hair, a slim figure and dressed elegantly, though rarely in the height of fashion. There was no kissing or embracing within the household and Maria Alexandrovna generally discouraged displays of emotion. She was the dominant figure at home, deeply respected and revered by all her children. &#x2018;She had our love and obedience,&#x2019; the eldest Ulyanov daughter, Anna, recalled later. &#x2018;She never raised her voice, and almost never resorted to punishment.&#x2019; <br><br>She was long-suffering and always sheltered her children from the reduced circumstances they would face following family deaths and the constant attention of the secret police. She was frugal but never mean. Intelligent and well educated, she never supported &#x2013; and often did not understand &#x2013; her children&#x2019;s radical politics. She was certainly not a Marxist or a revolutionary of any kind. But she knew better than to quarrel with her children over a political issue or ask too many questions about their illegal activities, whatever the suffering their beliefs would bring them. Few of her letters to her son Vladimir have survived, but in those she barely mentioned politics once. To Maria Alexandrovna, family came first. <br><br>At various points all of her grown-up children were jailed or exiled, on occasions several of them at once. She would always move near their prison or to a town as close as possible to their place of exile. Often she would humiliate herself pleading with officials to release one of her daughters or sons, or to treat them more leniently. Though never rich, she was comfortably off and all of them relied on her money for prolonged periods. She sent them cash, clothes, books, food parcels and never appeared to complain about being asked. Vladimir would request help more than any of her other children, though at times he received ample funds from elsewhere. For some years he awarded himself a salary from Bolshevik Party funds, but he earned little from his books and journalism. Life as a professional revolutionary could be precarious and at times he was short of ready money; well into his forties he could not have survived without regular help from his mother. <br><br>Vladimir possessed little of the serenity and patient forbearance of Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, but he did inherit other features of her character. &#x2018;No sooner had I come to know his mother than I discovered the secret of Vladimir Ilyich&#x2019;s charm,&#x2019; said Ivan Baranov, a comrade from Lenin&#x2019;s early revolutionary years. <br><br>His father&#x2019;s ancestry was as problematic as his mother&#x2019;s for Soviet historians. The last official Lenin biography published in the USSR, which appeared in the 1950s, stated that his father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, hailed from &#x2018;poor lower-middle-class people from Astrakhan&#x2019;, which hides more than it tells. Lenin&#x2019;s paternal grandmother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnov, was an illiterate Kalmyk woman with Central Asian roots who possessed the typical looks of her ethnic origin. Most physical descriptions of Lenin mention his &#x2018;Mongol eyes&#x2019; and high cheekbones, but the Soviets systematically suppressed information about his grandparents. They would not have fitted neatly with the carefully burnished official image of the founder of Bolshevism, who had to be presented as a Great Russian through and through.<br><br>Ilya was born in 1831 and both his parents died young. He was brought up and given a good education by his uncle Vasily, a prosperous tailor and merchant who ran a successful business in Astrakhan, a smelly fishing town along the delta where the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea. He qualified as a teacher of the sciences and taught at a series of secondary schools in provincial towns in southern Russia. He married in 1863 and taught in Nizhny Novgorod until 1869, when he was given a big promotion as Inspector of Schools in the Simbirsk Region, a job that won him the rank of a hereditary noble. <br><br>Of all the Ulyanov children, Vladimir looked the most like his father. Ilya Ulyanov had slanted eyes that flashed amber, a big domed forehead and reddish hair which he began to lose in his early twenties. Like his son he couldn&#x2019;t pronounce his &#x2018;r&#x2019;s properly and on occasions he had a hint of a lisp. He was more outgoing than his wife and enjoyed company. He was away much of the time on tours of inspection around the vast schools district under his supervision. Lenin&#x2019;s mother, although nominally Lutheran, seldom went to church. His father was religious and ensured that the children were brought up Orthodox in a traditional Russian manner. <br><br>He was a thoroughly decent man of liberal views, who believed in gradual reform and evolutionary change through education &#x2013; the kind of well-meaning bourgeois that his son would come to despise and scorn more bitterly than he did a diehard reactionary. Ilya revered Alexander II, the &#x2018;Tsar Liberator&#x2019; who emancipated the serfs in 1861 and launched a series of other modest measures to modernise the Romanov autocracy. After he was assassinated in 1881 by terrorists from the People&#x2019;s Will revolutionary group Ilya Ulyanov wept for days. In full-dress civil service uniform he attended the memorial service at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Simbirsk. He was a proud member of the establishment. As far as is recorded he was in contact with only one known &#x2018;subversive&#x2019;, the Ulyanov family doctor, Alexander Kadyan, who had been sent into internal exile by the secret police and was forced under the terms of his sentence to stay within the town.

Born on April 28, 1758, James Monroe was the son of Spence Monroe, who signed himself both carpenter and gentleman, and the former Elizabeth Jones, daughter of the architect James Jones. In 1766, when James was eight, Spence Monroe joined Northern Neck farmers in signing a pledge against the consumption of English imports until repeal of the hated Stamp Act, marking him a "patriot." James's uncle, Joseph Jones, was a judge and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, serving on its committees that drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Virginia Constitution, and a member of the Continental Congress. Judge Jones claimed a "confidential" friendship with George Washington and close relations with both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and he was to be the formative early political influence on James Monroe's life, his patron, and a constant adviser on matters ranging from personal finance to high political ambition.One biographer has written that Monroe, as an adult, "resembled his uncle in many ways--reflective, never rushing to conclusions but forming opinions deliberately. The same tact, warmth, and patience in human relations, so pronounced in the judge's character, wereequally apparent in the nephew."1 Later in life, when it came to confrontation with Alexander Hamilton, Edmund Randolph, less directly John Adams, and even George Washington himself, Monroe's tact and patience would be sorely tested and frayed.Young Monroe was accompanied on his long, woods-lined walks to Parson Campbell's school, Campbelltown Academy, by his neighbor and friend John Marshall, the future chief justice of the United States. With their schoolbooks in mathematics and Latin, both boys carried frontier rifles. Marshall, slightly older, would also join Monroe at William and Mary in 1774 and from there into the Continental army. Just three months after the Revolutionary Virginia Convention passed its own "declaration of independence" on May 15, 1776, Lieutenant Monroe, with the Third Virginia Regiment, marched out of Williamsburg northward to join the Continentals under Washington at New York. Three years later, when Monroe headed back to Virginia seeking recruits for another regiment, he left with the letter from Washington describing his combat service in considerable detail and recommending him as "a brave, active, and sensible officer" and expressing "the high opinion I have of his worth."Despite his plan, conveyed to Jefferson in the fall of 1781 at the conclusion of five years' military service, to travel to Europe to study, Monroe was elected to the Virginia Assembly from neighboring King George County the following year. During this period, Jefferson began his lifelong role as mentor to Monroe. "Jefferson, as he was to do on many subsequent occasions, exerted a decisive influence on Monroe's life," writes Monroe's biographer Harry Ammon. "At this time, Monroe, who was floundering about and had no idea what to do with himself, badly needed advice and encouragement. The Governor [Jefferson] provided exactly the right tonic, administered with tact, understanding, and a very real concern about the young man's fate."2 With his friend Marshall, Monroe was soon elected to Virginia's eight-member Executive Council, "rather young for a Councillor," according to one observer. He continued on the political fast track by being elected to the fourth ConfederationCongress in June 1783 and two subsequent congresses thereafter. Rembrandt Peale's famous painting of Washington resigning his commission before the Congress in Annapolis on July 27, 1783, following the signing of a treaty of peace with England, has both Monroe and Madison foremost wearing cocked hats. Monroe, still only twenty-five, dined regularly with Jefferson before the senior figure left for France, as the American minister in Paris.Among political leaders during this period, Monroe was on the forefront of those who viewed things nationally, rather than merely as citizens of individual states. Early on, he demonstrated the national security prism through which he was to view great events with these words regarding the many issues facing the new nation: "There are before us some questions of the utmost consequence that can arise in the councils of any nation," among them, "whether we are to have regular or standing troops to protect our frontiers, or leave them unguarded; whether we will expose ourselves to the inconveniences, which may perhaps be the loss of the country westward, from the impossibility of preventing the adventurers [pioneers] from settling where they please; the intrusion of the settlers on the European powers who border us, a cause of discontent and perhaps war."3Here we see, presciently, Monroe's very early anticipation of matters that would dominate his own presidency decades later, the frictions caused by the new nation's natural expansion against and eventually onto the territory claimed by European powers and perhaps even the role of those powers in the entire American hemisphere. And, significantly, Monroe anticipated matters in terms ("discontent and perhaps war") of a military officer. "From the beginning," writes his biographer W. P. Cresson, "James Monroe, a former militia man, who had served beneath the Rattlesnake Flag with the pioneers, was by instinct and sympathy a 'Man of the Western Waters.' From the frontiersmen he was to draw much of his political strength and, in return, was to serve them with all the ability and energy at his command."4Monroe's view was, at least in part, influenced by his uncle JudgeJones, who was an early exponent of the cession of frontier lands to the federal government for the purpose of creating new states. Other proponents of this plan included Washington, Jefferson, George Mason, and others of the "new states" persuasion. For himself and others, Washington advocated reward of the frontier lands to poorly compensated Continental army veterans, a movement soon to be led by the newly formed Society of the Cincinnati. Monroe's commitment to this cause is demonstrated by his trip in the fall of 1784 through the territories west of New York and southward through the Ohio Territory, where he reported, "It is possible I may lose my scalp from the temper of the Indians, but if either a little fighting or a great deal of running will save it I shall escape safe."5 In this, he later wrote Jefferson, he was not being entirely frivolous, for three members of his expeditions were in fact killed by angry Indians.Monroe's interests in questions of western expansion were to preoccupy him throughout his public life. Following this early trip, he argued in the Confederation Congress for rigorous steps to garrison the former British posts on the western frontier with American troops, and he took up the emerging cause of American rights to navigate the Mississippi River. As Cresson notes:In the struggle for this greater empire, which now forms the might and glory of the Republic, no statesman of his time played a more significant part than James Monroe. As the champion in Congress of the still-undefined rights of the United States to the lands ceded by the Treaty of 1783 and to the free navigation of the Mississippi, he performed a service for which credit has too often been denied him. When Jefferson left for France, it was Monroe who took his place as the champion of the "Men of the Western Waters." His authority in these matters was recognized by his contemporaries and they elected him to the chairmanship of the two important committees chiefly concerned with western interests.6In these matters Monroe quickly found himself at odds with John Jay, who had just been named the Confederation Congress's minister for foreign affairs. Jay was willing to sacrifice westward expansion by pioneers and frontiersmen in favor of transatlantic trading relationships with Great Britain and France on behalf of eastern commercial interests.Jay was a New Yorker and on the side of New England and the eastern states. Their economic future was tied to the transatlantic and West Indies trade. As the dominant southern power, Virginia, together with North Carolina, claimed land west to the Mississippi and northwestward to include the Northwest Territory (today's Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin). Jefferson, who proposed ceding these claims to the national government for westward expansion, left to serve as minister to France in 1785, and Monroe took up this cause. In 1787 he succeeded in creating a territorial government through passage of the Northwest Ordinance. Jay, speaking for the eastern commercial interests, saw westward expansion and the opening of western waterways, particularly the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans, as competition for New England. In negotiating with Spanish envoy Don Diego de Enrique Gardoqui, Jay, against his instructions, implicitly traded western interests in opening the Mississippi for expanded trade between New England and Spain.In a letter to Patrick Henry, then governor of Virginia, on August 12, 1786, the outraged Monroe described Jay's dishonesty and manipulations: "This is one of the most extraordinary transactions I have ever known, a minister negotiating expressly for the purpose of defeating the object of his instructions, and by a long train of intrigue &amp; management seducing the representative of the states to concur in it." He went on to summarize Jay's true intentions as "a dismemberment of the States east of the Hudson from the Union &amp; the erection of them into a separate govt."7 Thus the Monroe-Jay feud, to surface mightily with the Jay Treaty in 1794, was born.During the same period Monroe's relationship with James Madison, seven years his senior, whom he had replaced in the Virginia Assembly in 1783, began to develop, largely at the initial instigation of Jefferson, who glowingly introduced him to Madison: "The scrupulousness of his honor will make you safe in the most confidential communications. A better man cannot be."8Madison shared Monroe's concerns about Jay's promotion of the eastern trade interests at the expense of the frontiersmen's rights of Mississippi navigation. Monroe believed "the whole development of the Union was at stake" on this issue; upon it would depend "whether the United States was to constitute a nation or was to repeat, upon a new continent, the petty and complicated state system of Europe."9 Like western expansion generally, the rights to navigation of the Mississippi specifically would be an issue consuming Monroe throughout most of his public life. "Indeed, until a generation of native western leaders emerged just before the War of 1812," according to one historian, "Monroe was looked upon as the only national figure identified with the aims of the West."10Also during this period Monroe, who had yet to travel abroad, began to take a keen interest in foreign affairs and the appointment of appropriate diplomatic emissaries to important posts.Two recurring themes now permeated Monroe's private life: his physical health and his financial health. Though constitutionally sturdy, he began to be plagued by a variety of ailments, some of which would send him to bed. Also, having gone virtually directly from military service into politics, he now found himself well into his twenties without a profession or a dependable source of income. Unlike his friend John Marshall, he continued to put off applying to the bar. Although described at the time as merely "respectable looking," Monroe managed to win the hand of a beautiful New York socialite, Elizabeth Kortright, who "had the hauteur of the born aristocrat and was something of a grande dame even in her girlhood," and they were married in February 1786. Later that fall Monroe resigned from Congress and, with his bride, returned to live at Judge Jones's house in Fredericksburg, where he was finally admitted to the bar.It was a good match. Monroe's biographer Ammon summarized it thus: "The bond which united the Monroes was a remarkably close one, rendering every separation painful."11 Jefferson took the occasion to write a letter to Monroe, meant also for his wife's eyes, regarding the glories of quiet domestic life, possibly in preference to the social whirl she had left in New York: "Quiet retirement ... is the only point upon which the mind can settle at rest ... . But I must not philosophize too much with her lest I give her too serious apprehensions of a friendship I shall impose upon her."12Politics, however, was still very much in Monroe's blood, and within months he managed to get himself elected to the town council in Fredericksburg and soon thereafter returned to the Virginia Assembly. The first of three children--two daughters and a son who died young--was added to his new family in December 1786. But to Jefferson, who was fifteen years older than Monroe and, like Madison, now a continuous correspondent, he wrote, "My anxiety however for the gen'l welfare hath not diminished." Of these three men, whose lives were to continue to intersect for another forty or more years, one historian has written: "No personal relationship founded on common interests, opinions, and loyalties such as united these three men ... has ever more profoundly affected the political life of a nation."13In September 1787 the Constitutional Convention completed its labors, but without the participation of James Monroe. When Virginia governor Edmund Randolph had passed him over as a delegate, Monroe initially held Randolph and Madison responsible, but later he took the slight less personally. However, he did manage to become a delegate to the Virginia ratification convention in June 1788, and, as a neutral figure leaning toward the new national government and ratification--then tilting against, at least until the eloquent Madison spoke--he argued the case for the inclusion of some requirement of the federal government to guarantee his continuing cause, free navigation of the Mississippi by American frontiersmen.Harry Ammon points out as well that Monroe "was almost alone among the anti-federalists in recommending that the federalgovernment be given direct control over the militia as a means of eliminating the need for a standing army."14 This was a crucial issue for both federalists and antifederalists. How could the new nation be secure from foreign threats, of which there were considerable, if defended primarily by citizen-soldiers, often not properly trained or equipped? Here Monroe's military service informed his judgment on national security matters. But he broke ranks with his republican allies adroitly. He wished the federal executive to have, under threat, the authority to "nationalize" the militia (later the National Guard) in the interest of national security--essentially the constitutional position that was to evolve many decades later.15 James Monroe was among the first of the early national leaders to appreciate the degree to which the security of the nation had to be a responsibility of the national authority and not dependent on the individual states.Though Monroe joined the antifederalists in voting against ratification of the proposed Constitution, he was--particularly under the influence of George Washington--among the first to cross the aisle to accept its adoption. Patrick Henry devised a gerrymandered scheme that would send a completely antifederalist delegation from V...</p><h2>The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance</h2><p>Exploring the religious impulse known as mysticism - the &#34;silent cry&#34; at the heart of all the world&#39;s religions. Mysticism, in the sense of a &#34;longing for God,&#34; has been present in all times, cultures, and religions. But Soelle believes it has never been more important than in this age of materialism and fundamentalism. The antiauthoritarian mystical element in each religion leads to community of free spirits and resistance to the death-dealing aspects of our contemporary culture. Religion in the third millennium, Soelle argues, either will be mystical or it will be dead. Therefore, Soelle identifies strongly with the hunger of New Age searchers, but laments the religious fast food they devour. Today, a kind of &#34;democratized mysticism&#34; of those without much religious background flourishes. This mystical experience is not drawn so much of the tradition as out of contemporary experiences. In that sense, each of us is a mystic, and Soelle&#39;s work seeks to give theological depth, clarity, and direction. This, her magnum opus, conjoins Soelle&#39;s deep religious knowledge and wisdom with her passion for social justice into a work destined to be a classic of religious literature.</p><p>From the Foreword (pre-publication version): &#x201c;What is more splendid than gold?&#x201d; asked the king. &#x201c;The light,&#x201d; replied the serpent. &#x201c;What is more refreshing than light?&#x201d; the former asked. &#x201c;Conversation,&#x201d; the latter said. &#x2014;Goethe, &#x201c;The Fairy Tale&#x201d; <p>When I began writing this book, Fulbert Steffensky read the first pages of the manuscript and spontaneously made some critical comments. I responded and the following spousal conversation ensued. </p><p>Fulbert: What bothers me about mysticism is that it&#x2019;s really not something for simple folk. I can&#x2019;t imagine that my mother or my father could get anything from what you&#x2019;re trying to do here. </p><p>Dorothee: (humming) Into his love [In seine Lieb versenken] I will wholly plunge myself, [will ich mich ganz hinab,] my heart is to be his [mein Herz will ich ihm schenken] and all that I have. [und alles was ich hab.] </p><p>Fulbert: Piety, yes, but mysticism? </p><p>Dorothee: I suppose that mysticism is always piety, even when it takes on utterly degenerate forms such as Satanic Masses. If I understand the meaning at all of this Christmas carol by Friedrich von Spee (1591-1635), then I can also talk about syntheresis voluntatis. Your mother wouldn&#x2019;t have known what to do with that, but perhaps it could be useful to her clever grandchildren, who live without Christmas carols but not without philosophy. </p><p>Fulbert: Back again to my mother. I believe that she can appropriate every sentence of the New Testament tradition as nourishing bread on which one can live a normal and burdened life. But what is she to do with the curious religious ingenuities of a Jacob B�hme, or John of the Cross? Surely, the Gospel itself deals more with the simple and sensible desires of people: to be healthy and not having to despair of life, to be able to see and hear, to live for once without tears and to have a name. It&#x2019;s not about spiritual artistry but about the possibility of simply living. </p><p>Dorothee: But aren&#x2019;t mystics concerned precisely with the bread of life? As I see it, the problem is that people, including your mother, but certainly her children and grandchildren, encounter not just the Gospel but something that has been distorted, corrupted, destroyed and long been turned into stone. </p><p>Mysticism has helped those who were gripped by it to face powerful but petrified institutions that conformed to society; it still helps them today, albeit in a manner that is often very odd. What you call spiritual artistry may figure in it, but the essence of mysticism is something very different. One evening, without knocking first, I entered your mother&#x2019;s room. And there she was, the old lady, sitting on her chair with her hands folded--no needlework! I don&#x2019;t know whether to call what she was doing &#x201c;praying&#x201d; or &#x201c;reflecting.&#x201d; But great peace was with her. That is what I want to spread abroad. </p><p>Fulbert: Perhaps my reticence towards mystics is not meant so much for them as it is for a certain craving for mysticism prevalent in the present religious climate. The high regard for categories of religious experience is in an inflationary growth rate. The religious subject wants to experience the self without mediation, instantly, totally and authentically, in the manner she or he shapes personal piety. Experience justifies substance and becomes the actual content of religiousness. And then direct experience stands against institution, against the slowness of a journey, against the crusty, dark bread of the patient dealing with oneself. In this craving for experience, everything that occurs suddenly and is direct rather than institution-mediated becomes ever so interesting; everything that&#x2019;s oriented to experience and promises religious sensation. I know, genuine mysticism is completely different from this. But that&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s perceived. </p><p>Dorothee: I&#x2019;m also concerned when immediacy becomes the chief category. I think that the great figures of the tradition of mysticism have chewed on some of your crusty, dark bread. As Huxley once said, there is no &#x201c;instant Zen-Buddhism.&#x201d; The &#x201c;now&#x201d; of the mystics is an experience of time that is no common experience. This has nothing to do with a teenage sense of life, the &#x201c;right this moment&#x201d; of wanting a certain kind of sneaker or ice-cream. </p><p>I cannot agree with your covert pleading for the institution--as if the bread it baked were edible! I think there must be a third entity, next to voguish &#x201c;religious sensation,&#x201d; and the homespun institutions that are in charge of such things. You are seeking something like that yourself, except that you call it spirituality. </p><p>Fulbert: When I speak of spirituality I always rule out the ideas of particularity and extraordinary experience. It&#x2019;s the name, more than anything else, that makes &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d; so alluring. What spirituality itself actually is has much to do with method, order and repetition. It&#x2019;s a matter of constituting the self, in the midst of banality and everydayness. And everyone who is not utterly beaten down by life can work at it. Spirituality is not a via regia, an elevated pathway, but a via laborosa, a labor-intensive regimen for determining one&#x2019;s own vision and life-options. And so I stick doggedly to the notion that something is important only when it&#x2019;s important for everyone. </p><p>But it&#x2019;s possible that in mysticism, what manifests itself in dramatically concentrated form and artistic expression, so to speak, is what constitutes the nature of piety and faith. This would mean that mysticism may in fact be neither the road of all nor of many. Rather, it may be that in poetic density the nature of a faith that is meant for all is revealed within mysticism. </p><p>Dorothee: My most important concern is to democratize mysticism. What I mean to do is to reopen the door to the mystic sensibility that&#x2019;s within all of us, to dig it out from under the debris of trivia--from its self-trivialization, if you like. An older woman in New York told me about meeting a guru. When she told her black minister about this, he asked only one question. It&#x2019;s a question I too want to ask: &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t he tell you that we&#x2019;re all mystics?&#x201d;</p>Dorothee Soelle studied philosophy, theology, and literature at the University of Cologne and served as Professor of Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1975 to 1987.

Do any of them sound familiar?<br> &nbsp;<br> My involvement in meditation dates back nearly twenty years, but I will tell you up front that the overwhelming majority of my initial efforts were, at best, mediocre and, at worst, an exercise in futility&#x2014;and by <i>initial</i> I&#x2019;m referring to the first few <i>years</i> of dabbling.<br> &nbsp;<br> I first got the idea to try meditating while in yoga classes, where my teachers mentioned that the sole purpose of doing yoga was to prepare our bodies for seated meditation. The various spiritual books I was reading at the time also echoed the importance of meditation as a path to experiencing inner bliss, or nirvana, an internal experience reportedly so serene that you would lose awareness of all of your worries, doubts, and fears and be bathed in a feeling of oneness. Who could resist such a promise? I didn&#x2019;t need any more convincing that meditation would do me a world of good, but I was skeptical about my ability to get my mind to the needed place.<br> &nbsp;<br> I lived in New York at the time and found a weekly class (the cost was a five-dollar donation) held in the bell tower of the historic Riverside Church, close to my apartment. Martha, the facilitator, started off by telling us about her meditation master, a professional snowboarder and music producer who gained enlightenment on a snowy mountaintop in Nepal after a miraculous run-in with a Buddhist monk. He taught meditation and spirituality for many years and died in his forties (Martha was vague about his cause of death, which I discovered later was suicide), leaving behind an archive of New Age music he produced, to which his students began meditating. <br> &nbsp;<br> Martha instructed us to sit up tall (with our backs erect, not touching the chair), close our eyes, and give our full attention to one of the songs that was composed by the aforementioned meditation master. While listening, she encouraged us to feel the sensations in our body and mind, and be present to the sounds and vibrations within the song. If our mind got distracted and began veering off to some errant thought, we were to let go of the thought and return our attention to the New Age music, which sounded like a mash-up of smooth jazz and opera. This was not what I was expecting. But I sat there trying to remain open to the possibility of having the intended meditative experience. Maybe the monk would appear to me in my meditation, I thought&#x2014;half sarcastically and half optimistically<br> Four minutes in, I felt nothing but frustration. When the song ended, Martha had us open our eyes and share our experiences. One woman reported hearing the subtle sounds embedded within the song. The guy next to me said he felt a delightful tingly sensation in his hands and feet. Others reported similar experiences of movement of energy, or celestial epiphanies. I kept quiet, because the entire time I felt like I had been just sitting there, listening to New Age music with my eyes closed.<br> &nbsp;<br> We &#x201c;meditated&#x201d; through three or four more songs that first night, and although I desperately wanted to intuit some hidden message about the universe&#x2014;or simply just feel anything&#x2014; nothing special happened. Maybe I was trying too hard, I thought. Or perhaps I needed to come back and give it another try next week. Maybe it would take another three months . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> Disappointed, I dropped my five-dollar bill into the donation bucket on the way out and rode my bike home, not fully sure if I would ever crack the elusive meditation code. Being as curious as I was skeptical, though, I vowed to return to Martha&#x2019;s group, even if it meant remaining insecure about my inability to silence my mind and feel the supposed bliss of meditation.<br> &nbsp;<br> I took personal responsibility for my lack of success. Could it have been all the fast food and soda pop I consumed while growing up in Alabama? Was it possible I had a genetic mental block that prohibited me from achieving the elusive state of bliss? Could it be that I was already enlightened and didn&#x2019;t need to meditate at all?<br> &nbsp;<br> Nah. Turns out I just went to the wrong class.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, it would take another couple of years of dabbling in different meditation scenes before I figured that out. In the meantime, the novelty of telling people that I meditated was enough to keep me curious about the practice. They didn&#x2019;t have to know that I wasn&#x2019;t actually experiencing anything in meditation other than my normal thinking mind. In fact, nobody had to know.<br> &nbsp;<br> HOW NOT TO MEDITATE <br> I heard several of my yoga teachers insist that there is no &#x201c;right&#x201d; way to meditate&#x2014;that we are our own guru, and therefore we should do what feels right to us in the moment. Therefore, I constantly wondered if I was practicing the best style for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> At various times in those early years, I tried meditating with my back straight and legs crossed, as I had seen monks do in movies. I tried meditating while lying down, meditating in a field of grass, meditating at the end of yoga class, meditating while sitting on a yoga bolster, meditating on my friend&#x2019;s living room floor. I tried astral-traveling meditations, channeling meditations, communing-with-my-spirit-guide meditations, Zen meditations, mindfulness meditations, barefoot-walking meditations, holotropic-breathing meditations, mala-bead meditations, and staring-at-the-candle meditations, as well as frequent meditation sits at the local Hare Krishna temple.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gradually, it dawned on me that if meditation delivers a blissful experience, it must happen about as often as Halley&#x2019;s Comet appears in the night sky. By far the more common experience I had was physical pain from sitting with my back straight, interspersed with the frustration of battling my mind, chased with heavy doses of boredom. <br> &nbsp;<br> Over time, my default position became sitting with my legs crossed, with my back as straight as possible, while resting my palms on my thighs, and with my thumb and index fingers lightly touching. But time and again, instead of feeling my chakras align, or my energy shift&#x2014;or <i>anything</i>, for that matter&#x2014;mostly what I felt was searing pain in my lower back while my bare ankles dug into the hard floor so that I could keep pressing my back into a more upright position. Meanwhile, my erratic mind played variations of good-cop-bad-cop, bad-cop-bad-cop, and bad-copworse-cop when it came to my ability to meditate with success, which often left me checking my watch every thirty seconds and counting down the minutes until the dreaded experience was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was becoming increasingly discouraged and jaded. Why were people so enthusiastic about this spiritual torture experience? How could something so obviously laborious continue to exist for thousands of years? How did the word &#x201c;bliss&#x201d; ever come to be associated with such a thoroughly unblissful experience? I felt like I was living in some sort of bizarre meditation version of <i>The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes</i>&#x2014;standing on the sidelines as the procession went by, witnessing everyone else sing the praises of this glorious practice that was supposedly garbed in pure bliss.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ironically, when I became a yoga teacher a few years after my inaugural meditation experience in New York, I began leading guided meditations at the end of my classes. I was seen as a meditation expert even though I never received meditation instruction during my yoga teacher training, nor did I have a consistent meditation practice of my own at the time. In order to compensate for my personal inability to sit in silence, I did what many yoga teachers do, and parroted the stock meditation instructions I heard <i>my</i> yoga teachers give over the years: let go of your worries, visualize waterfalls and white lights enveloping you, calm your mind, and don&#x2019;t forget to notice your breath in the process. In other words, I became the emperor!<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody needed to know how much of a monkey mind I was experiencing while I was guiding them, or how much I struggled to feel my own bliss. I knew how to look and sound the part, soft voice and all. Maybe that&#x2019;s the jig, I thought: everyone is pretending, and meditation is all about faking like you&#x2019;re blissed out even though you aren&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> What I didn&#x2019;t know then, and probably wouldn&#x2019;t have believed if someone had told me, was that I was about to experience a 180-degree turn in my attitude toward meditation. Indeed, meditation would soon become the bliss-inducing practice I had always hoped it could be, and would revolutionize my life in the most unexpected ways.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>One Little Spark!: Mickey&#39;s Ten Commandments and The Road to Imagineering</h2><p>We've all read about the experts: the artists, the scientists, the engineers-that special group of people known as Imagineers for The Walt Disney Company. But who are they? How did they join the team? What is it like to spend a day in their shoes?<br><br>Disney Legend Marty Sklar wants to give back to fans and answer these burning questions. When Marty was president of Walt Disney Imagineering, he created a list of principles and ideals for the team, aptly named Mickey's Ten Commandments. Using this code of standards as his organizational flow, Marty provides readers with insights and advice from himself and dozens of hands-on Imagineers from around the globe. It's a true insider's look like no other!</p><p>Marty Sklar was a student at UCLA and editor of its <i>Daily Bruin</i> newspaper in 1955 when he was recruited to create an 1890s-themed newspaper, <i>The </i><i>Disneyland</i><i> </i><i>News</i>, a month before the theme park opened. After graduating, he joined Disneyland full-time in 1956, where he held responsibility for most of the park's publicity and marketing materials. <br>In 1961, he moved to WED Enterprises, renamed in 1986 to Walt Disney Imagineering, where he worked on attractions for the 1964 New York World's Fair. For nearly ten years, he wrote personal materials for Walt Disney for use in publications, television and special films. In 1974 he became vice president of concepts/planning, and guided the creative development of EPCOT. <br><br>As vice president of creative development, executive vice president and then president of Imagineering for nine years, Sklar supervised the design and construction of Tokyo Disneyland, the Disney-MGM Studios, Disneyland Paris, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Disney California Adventure Park, Tokyo DisneySea, the Walt Disney Studios Park and most recently Hong Kong Disneyland. <br><b>PRAISE FOR DREAM IT!

Some of the Imagineers are known by many Disney fans, while others are less so, which reinforces another recurring theme: 'The achievement of the Imagineers are not those of brilliant individuals acting alone-it's all about the perfect blending of talents.

She lives in Malibu, California.In a lyrical and gritty narrative, Beatty tells us how she acquired her wisdom about codependency, self-destructiveness and the addictive personality. It's not a pretty picture, but it serves the purpose of prodding listeners to stay with their own discomfort and to let it inform their lives. She also teaches us that we can have relationships with people who respect God's order for them, rather than trying to control or subvert them.

As a pregnant woman planning to bring a new life into this world, you are embarking on an amazing journey.</p><p>Pregnancy and birth are as ordinary and extraordinary as breathing, thinking, or loving. Whether you are pregnant for the first time or are already a mother, pregnancy will call on your creativity, flexibility, endurance, and humor. You will face many choices that will affect your pregnancy, birth experience, and life as a new mother. As you consider your options, you'll want to learn as much as you can about your developing pregnancy and various childbirth practices and think about the experiences you hope to have. What kind of care do you want to receive during pregnancy? Where do you wish to give birth? Who would you like to be with you when you are in labor?</p><p>Most pregnant women are bombarded with advice from well-meaning friends, relatives, and even strangers. Everyone seems to have an opinion on what you should or shouldn't do, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed by their conflicting recommendations.</p><p>This book will help you sort fact from fiction. By drawing on the most accurate research, the personal experiences of many individual women, and the advice of midwives, physicians, and other health care providers, it will give you the information you need to make wise decisions and approach birth with confidence.</p><p></p>CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE, CLIMATE OF DOUBT<p>Pregnancy and birth are normal, healthy processes for most women, the vast majority of whom have healthy pregnancies and babies. But when was the last time you saw a newspaper article titled "3.5 Million American Women Had Normal Labors and Healthy Babies This Year" or a TV episode that showed a healthy woman giving birth to a healthy newborn, without a sense of emergency or a heroic rescue?</p><p>The media's preference for portraying emergency situations, and doctors saving babies, sends the message that birth is fraught with danger. Other factors, including the way doctors are trained, financial incentives in the health care system, and a rushed, risk-averse society, also contribute to the popular perception that childbirth is an unbearably painful, risky process to be "managed" in a hospital with the use of many tests, drugs, and procedures. In such an environment, the high-tech medical care that is essential for a small proportion of women and babies has become the norm for almost everyone.</p><p>Some advocates for childbearing women describe this as a "climate of doubt" that increases women's anxiety and fear. In contrast, a climate of confidence focuses on our bodies' capacity to give birth. Such a climate reinforces women's strengths and abilities and minimizes fear. Some of the factors that nourish a climate of confidence include high-quality prenatal care; healthy food and time to rest and exercise; a safe work and home environment; childbearing leave; clear, accurate information about pregnancy and birth; encouragement, love, and support from those close to you; and skilled and compassionate health care providers. As your pregnancy develops, do what you can to seek out such resources.</p><p><i>When I found out I was pregnant, my blood pressure was a little on the high side. But I had a great doctor who helped me take care of myself and my baby. She knew all the details of my personal problems -- being unmarried, and with a partner who had an addiction problem -- and she treated me with nothing but respect. I think it made all the difference in having a healthy baby. In spite of my difficult circumstances and the stress, I actually had a very good pregnancy and had a lot of love and support.</i></p><p><i>My husband loved my pregnancy. He'd want to play jazz to my belly and sing to my belly. He'd rub cream on the stretch marks and tell the baby the play-by-play of the baseball game. He and our cat both seemed more protective of me and I felt very loved by my little family of two.</i></p><p></p>QUESTIONING HIGH-TECH BIRTH<p>The path to motherhood involves navigating through a health care system that can be complex and sometimes intimidating. While some aspects of maternity care are shaped by economic, social, and political forces that are beyond our individual control, there are things you can do to increase your chances of having a healthy and satisfying pregnancy, birth, and early postpartum period. The following chapters provide advice, support, and resources to guide you as you learn about your pregnancy, seek prenatal care, and face decisions about the kind of birth you want.</p><p>As you make these decisions, it's important to understand that some elements of the care most women receive during pregnancy and childbirth are not based on the most reliable research on what is safe and effective. Some high-tech procedures are overused in the United States, while other practices that have been shown to improve birth outcomes are not offered widely. Being aware of this can help you access the best care for your situation.</p><p>When used appropriately, maternity care interventions such as artificial inductions of labor (use of drugs or techniques to try to start labor), episiotomies (cutting to enlarge the vaginal opening), epidurals (a kind of anesthesia), and cesarean sections (surgical deliveries) can improve health outcomes and even save lives. Yet far too often, these interventions are used routinely on healthy women who are at low risk for medical complications, despite clear scientific evidence that they are unnecessary, ineffective, and/or can cause harm. The widespread routine use of medical interventions during labor and birth has failed to improve the safety of childbirth for low-risk women. In addition, these interventions can disrupt the natural rhythms of labor, undermine women's confidence in our capacity to give birth, and decrease our satisfaction with our birth experiences.</p><p>At the same time that such procedures are <i>overused,</i> practices that have been shown to improve birth outcomes -- as well as increase women's satisfaction with the experience of giving birth -- are widely <i>underused.</i> These practices include receiving continuous one-on-one support from a skilled, experienced caregiver during labor; being able to change positions, get out of bed, and walk during labor; and using comfort measures such as massage, warm baths, and birthing balls. (For more information on how and why U.S. health systems are not always providing the best care possible and about efforts to change this, see Chapter 17, "Advocating for Better Maternity Care.")</p><p>As much as possible, surround yourself with the kinds of supportive practices that have been proven effective but are sometimes underused, and avoid unnecessary medical interventions. Choosing a health care provider and birth setting that make judicious, conservative use of interventions, learning about the advantages and disadvantages of different medical procedures and treatments that are offered to you, and declining those procedures and treatments that you do not need can help you have a safer, more satisfying birth experience.</p><p><i>My tips for pregnant women? Exercise. Eat healthy but splurge once in a while. Enjoy all of the attention. Wear comfortable shoes. Sleep every chance you get for as long as you can. Read and educate yourself about all of your choices regarding childbirth so you can feel in control and not like it is something that is happening to you. In addition, have an open mind [in case] things don't go how you planned.</i></p><p><i>It really helps to have someone there (if in a hospital) who can act as an advocate for the mother, like a doula [trained birth companion], mother, or good friend....You also have to make very clear what you want, because hospitals have certain routines and procedures that they are used to, and unless you tell them otherwise, they will go ahead with their routines (examples: putting drops in the baby's eyes right away and giving the shot of vitamin K, giving the baby a bath). I would say to keep an open mind, learn what your options are, [and try] to be an active participant in the whole process.</i></p><p></p>PLANNING A BETTER BIRTH<p>If you are healthy and have no medical complications that call for a "high-risk" approach to your care during labor and birth, you can increase your chances of having a safe and satisfying vaginal birth by trying the following strategies:</p><p><b>Find a doctor or midwife with low rates of intervention.</b></p><p></p><blockquote>Some caregivers have much lower rates of intervention than others. While rates of intervention will vary depending on the population served (for example, women carrying multiple babies and women with high blood pressure are more likely to need interventions), they also vary by the type of provider and the practice style. Although there are many exceptions, family physicians tend to have lower rates of intervention than obstetricians, and midwives generally have the lowest rates of all. These differences are partly due to varying degrees of risk among the women who choose an obstetrician, family physician, or midwife (for example, a woman with pregnancy complications will likely choose an obstetrician), and partly due to the differences in practice styles between types of providers. (For more information, see Chapter 2, "Choosing Your Health Care Provider and Birth Setting," particularly the section "Models of Maternity Care," page 15.)</blockquote><p><b>Choose a birth setting with low overall rates of intervention.</b></p><p></p><blockquote>Some birth settings have far lower rates of intervention than others. Use of interventions is much lower in out-of-hospital birth centers and home births, compared with hospitals. However, the rates of intervention among different hospitals can also vary widely, depending on the practices and policies of the hospital as well as the health problems of the women it serves. (For more information, see "Birth Settings," page 22.)</blockquote><p><b>Create your own birth plan and discuss it with your caregivers.</b></p><p></p><blockquote>Writing down your values, preferences, and priorities can help you...</blockquote></p><h2>Morgue: A Life in Death</h2><p><p><b>"[AN] ENGROSSING LOOK BEHIND THE HEADLINES OF NOTORIOUS HOMICIDES."&#x2015;<i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> (STARRED REVIEW)</b></p><p>In this clear-eyed, gritty, and enthralling narrative, Dr. Vincent Di Maio and veteran crime writer Ron Franscell guide us behind the morgue doors to tell a fascinating life story through the cases that have made Di Maio famous&#x2015;from the exhumation of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald to the complex issues in the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.</p><p>Beginning with his street-smart Italian origins in Brooklyn, the book spans forty years of work and more than nine thousand autopsies, and Di Maio&#x2019;s eventual rise into the pantheon of forensic scientists.

What <i>really </i>happened? Baffling questions remain unanswered, as these cases were closed far too soon for hundreds of people; Rule looks at them now through the eyes of a relentless crime reporter. The second probe began in Utah when Susan Powell vanished in a 2009 blizzard. Her controlling husband, Josh, proved capable of a blind rage that was heartbreakingly fatal to his innocent small sons almost three years later in a tragedy that shocked America as the details unfolded. If anyone had detected the depth of depravity within Josh Powell, perhaps the family that loved and trusted him would have been saved. In these and seven other riveting cases, Ann Rule exposes the twisted truth behind the fa�ades of <i>Fatal Friends, Deadly Neighbors.</i><br><br>These doomed relationships are the focus of queen of true crime Ann Rule&#x2019;s sixteenth all-new Crime Files collection.

She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.Fatal Friends, Deadly Neighbors <br>Chapter One<br> <br>One of the questions I am asked frequently is &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have nightmares about the cases you cover?&#x201d; Usually, I don&#x2019;t. There is nothing as cathartic for me as emptying my brain of the awful details I learn about murders and pouring them onto a blank screen. Yes, I have had nightmares over the last forty years&#x2014;but only a handful.<br> <br>The twisted maze of horrendous events that began on December 6, 2009, in West Valley City, Utah, however, has given me dark images as I slept. I will never forget writing about what has been deemed &#x201c;pure evil.&#x201d;<br> <br>Only in retrospect can I see where many of the tragic aspects of this story could have been and should have been prevented. If only they had been.<br> <br>Of the nine cases in this book, I have put off writing this one until the very last. I know why. I didn&#x2019;t want to think about it day after day, as I knew I would have to once I began to dig into the mental cesspools of two depraved minds.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Loving parents treasure their babies and watch over them as they grow. The irony of parenthood is that as much as we want to protect our children from any kind of harm, we have to prepare them to leave us and enter a world where there are dangers we can neither perceive or prevent. It can be so worrisome the first time children walk to school by themselves, or have a sleepover at a friend&#x2019;s house. And, before we know it, they are old enough to date and to drive a car, or ride in a car with drivers we don&#x2019;t really trust.<br> <br>But we bite our tongues and give them wings to fly by themselves. When grown children fall in love and choose someone to marry, we hope that person will be good to them. Sometimes we can see trouble ahead, but the more we find fault in whom they&#x2019;ve picked, the more likely they are to cling to them. Our eyes are not blinded by infatuation or love, and we can see personality traits that give us cause to worry when we know in our bones that our beloved children may end up with broken hearts and broken marriages. But, again, we keep our mouths shut and hope for the best.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Chuck and Judy Cox, who currently live in Puyallup, Washington, married for love, and they raised their four daughters in a happy and safe home. Mary was their firstborn in 1977, then Denise in 1979, Susan in 1981, and finally, Marie in 1984. Although many men might have been disappointed that they had no sons, Chuck was quite happy with his quartet of daughters. From the moment they were born, he was a protective father, doing his best to look after his girls.<br> <br>The Coxes are devout members of the Mormon faith. They met in eastern Washington, at Medical Lake, and Chuck soon decided the pretty young woman with long dark hair was the one for him, and it&#x2019;s obvious that he sees Judy today as he did then. He finds her as lovely as she was when she was a teenager, and she clearly cares for him the same way. As often happens, Chuck is the extrovert and Judy is the quiet one. Their likenesses and differences have bonded to make their marriage very successful over the years. At this point in their lives, they should be enjoying the retirement years most couples look forward to.<br> <br>Instead, they have lived with terror and despair.<br> <br>Chuck Cox is a pilot and a flight instructor, and Judy has made a home for him and their girls in many places around America: Denver; Minot, North Dakota; Holloman Air Force Base in Alamagordo, New Mexico; and Anchorage, Alaska. When he was in the air force, Chuck was an air traffic controller&#x2014;a &#x201c;Tower Flower,&#x201d; as he puts it&#x2014;and he scanned the boards constantly when he was on duty to be sure that all the planes he was responsible for were &#x201c;laddered,&#x201d; and that no two planes were ever on the same altitude and flight path at the same time.<br> <br>It is a high-stress job, of course, but Chuck was good at it. He learned to live with having the responsibility for so many lives in the air, and he never lost his cool. Back in civilian life, he had to choose whether to be a full-time pilot or a civilian air traffic controller. He chose the latter and worked at Portland International Airport and Troutdale Airport in Oregon. After that he was an Aviation Safety Inspector in Renton, Washington.<br> <br>Cox investigated crashes and near-crashes, and all of his jobs involved one aspect of flying or another. He recalls examining the circumstances of a particular collision in Moses Lake, Washington, where navy jet pilots in training routinely practiced low-level, high-speed flying maneuvers.<br> <br>&#x201c;A navy A3 jet flying low and at high speed collided with a crop duster. The A3&#x2019;s right engine impacted the biplane&#x2019;s left wing, and the propeller of the crop duster scratched and punctured the external fuel tank on the navy plane,&#x201d; Chuck explained. &#x201c;Both of the military pilots ejected safely, and the crop duster plummeted to the ground, which was freshly plowed and soft. A local man heard the crash and he was able to pull the biplane pilot out and call for help.<br> <br>&#x201c;While I was investigating the accident, some military investigators claimed, &#x2018;That agriculture plane hit our jet.&#x2019;<br> <br>&#x201c;I asked them how a hundred-mile-an-hour crop duster could catch up with and hit a five-hundred-mile-an-hour jet. They didn&#x2019;t have an explanation for that. I was just happy that all three pilots lived!&#x201d;<br> <br>Chuck Cox was always able to keep a level head when he had to, something that is a prerequisite for both a pilot and an air traffic controller. Those jobs, however, involved people he didn&#x2019;t know well&#x2014;or at all. They didn&#x2019;t deal with the people he loved and devoted his life to.<br> <br>Cox speaks his mind, and he can be stern when he needs to be. Lesser men would have broken long ago&#x2014;but not Chuck Cox. When he commits to a cause, he is a bulldog and nothing can shake him. His cause now is one that no one on earth would envy.<br> <br>Before Chuck Cox retired in February 2011, both he and Judy looked forward to a serene life. His father suffered from heart disease, but with a pacemaker, he was expected to live at least ten years. Chuck and Judy and his parents considered creating one household to reduce living costs so both families would be able to travel while they were still young enough to do so. Sadly, events involving Susan Cox Powell, Chuck and Judy&#x2019;s daughter, would put unbelievable stress on both couples and end their hopes for rewarding retirements.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dad died suddenly in January 2011,&#x201d; Chuck said. &#x201c;I think what happened to Susan put so much worry on his heart that it killed him. There were so many things that we all needed to say in response to attacks on us&#x2014;but we couldn&#x2019;t. We had to remain silent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since the Christmas season of 2009, the Cox family has lived with huge anxiety about Susan, their third daughter. Chuck and Judy have no idea if Susan is alive or dead. She vanished from the Utah home she shared with her husband, Josh, and their two little boys&#x2014;Charlie and Braden. She had allegedly left home in a blizzard on a frigid Sunday night. There was no word at all from her, no sightings, nothing. She was simply gone.<br> <br>The circumstances of her vanishing defy any rational explanation. For her family, dealing with them was excruciating. Susan&#x2019;s parents and sisters wanted to believe that she was alive and would come home again, but as the days and weeks passed, they sought for her in vain. Her case was so bizarre that the search for her spread across America. Dozens of publications, including People magazine, covered the story, which was picked up by the Associated Press. Surely, the Coxes thought, if Susan was able to she would have come forward. In a way, it&#x2019;s harder for families not to know where someone they love is than it is to accept their death and begin to recover.<br> <br>Judy, Chuck, and Susan&#x2019;s sisters were in limbo.<br> <br>Josh Powell was quite sure that his wife was safe and well, and he reassured those who were baffled and grieving. Indeed, Josh explained that he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to raise an alarm when Susan left their home on the night of December 6, 2009, because he didn&#x2019;t want to upset anyone prematurely.<br> <br>He was positive she was okay, even though she had seemingly disappeared into the whirlwind of snow and ice. Josh appeared to be embarrassed as he confessed that he believed Susan had run off with another man, leaving him alone to care for Charlie and Braden, who were only four and two.<br> <br>Although the Josh Powells sometimes seemed an unlikely couple, and had their share of problems, most of which they kept between themselves, the idea that Susan would have an affair with another man and desert her family to be with him was mind-boggling.<br> <br>Susan was a devout member of the Church of Latter-day Saints and she adored her little boys. She believed in her religion&#x2019;s tenets that marriage was for life&#x2014;and beyond&#x2014;and she had fought to save her own union. To everyone who knew her, the thought that she would abandon her children for a sinful affair was unbelievable.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Susan Cox was a bubbly, happy little girl and she remained that way into adulthood.<br> <br>She was a romantic who wanted to make the world better&#x2014;or, in her case, &#x201c;prettier.&#x201d; When the Coxes were living in Alaska, and she was four or five, she once used crayons to draw a flower on a newly painted wall. She explained why to her perturbed parents: &#x201c;I wanted to make it prettier.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hearing that, they couldn&#x2019;t punish her. Chuck cleaned the wall and Susan helped.<br> <br>In high school, one of her teachers asked her what her philosophy of life was.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Susan asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want to do with your life?&#x201d; the teacher explained. &#x201c;How do you look at the world?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want people to be pretty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So they will be happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>After graduation, she attended the Gene Juarez Academy of Beauty in Seattle, preparing for a career in that field. Her dream was to have her own beauty salon one day.<br> <br>Susan herself was attractive&#x2014;in a young Debbie Reynolds sort of way. She had bright blue eyes, wavy brown hair, and dimples. Dozens of photographs of her have been published and it&#x2019;s hard to find one in which she isn&#x2019;t smiling.<br> <br>Conversely, there are few pictures of Josh Powell where he is smiling. Once Susan&#x2019;s goal was to make Josh happy, to help him forget his abusive childhood.<br> <br>She was sure she could do that.<br> <br>Like many young Mormon singles in their late teens and twenties, she and her sisters often went to an LDS Stake Center at Twelfth and Pearl streets in Tacoma to interact with their peers in the single adult ward who were eighteen to thirty.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a marriage pool,&#x201d; Chuck Cox explains. &#x201c;She met Josh Powell there. She was nineteen and he was twenty-six. We felt he was hunting for someone who believed that the husband was the head of the house. Susan was in love&#x2014;you know, like the songs &#x2018;I Am Sixteen Going on Seventeen&#x2019; or &#x2018;They Tried to Tell Us We&#x2019;re Too Young.&#x2019; She was in love with Josh Powell, and no one could change her mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the surface, Josh didn&#x2019;t seem that bad a choice for Susan. He gave the impression that he believed in all the Mormon tenets, and Susan saw him as a very mature &#x201c;older&#x201d; man.<br> <br>While she was very well liked by the group at the Stake Center, Susan was aware that Josh lacked social skills: He had trouble fitting in. That didn&#x2019;t make her like him less; she actually felt a little sorry for him and tried to draw him into her circle of friends. It wasn&#x2019;t that Josh was shy; it was more that he talked too much about himself and his many accomplishments, and didn&#x2019;t seem very interested in other people. His affect was awkward, even a little peculiar. At first, of course, Susan didn&#x2019;t find him odd.<br> <br>Chuck and Judy couldn&#x2019;t understand Susan&#x2019;s fascination with Josh, and sometimes they argued about it, although they tried not to&#x2014;aware that the more they criticized Josh, the more their daughter would be attracted to him. She was a teenager and parents&#x2019; opinions aren&#x2019;t usually appreciated at that stage of life.<br> <br>&#x201c;I asked her once &#x2018;Why Josh?&#x2019; &#x201d; Judy Cox recalls, of when Susan started dating him seriously. &#x201c;And she wouldn&#x2019;t answer me. I think she wanted to help him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although judging others&#x2019; attractiveness is a most subjective position, most people would not describe Josh Powell as prepossessing. Rather than being a handsome, dynamic man, Josh looked like he was no older than sixteen or seventeen. At five feet, ten inches, he was slender and somewhat weak appearing. He had bright blue eyes and rosy cheeks, and scarcely any beard. Even though he was seven years older than Susan, he looked younger.<br> <br>Maybe he seemed so full of himself because beneath the surface he felt he didn&#x2019;t really measure up.<br> <br>Everything about Josh seemed weak. No one realized then that he was a &#x201c;control freak.&#x201d;<br> <br>But he was.<br> <br>To her family&#x2019;s continuing bewilderment, Susan Cox saw something in Josh that others didn&#x2019;t see. He had originally tried to date Susan&#x2019;s oldest sister, Mary, who didn&#x2019;t care for him at all. On the night of one of Mary&#x2019;s dances&#x2014;where she had a date with someone else&#x2014;Josh came over to the Coxes&#x2019; home to ask her for a date, unaware that this was totally inappropriate. He hung around her house, waiting for her until she came home. It was an awkward situation.<br> <br>Mary didn&#x2019;t want to go out with him, and she was alarmed when his attention turned to Susan. She kept warning Susan about Josh and advised her not to date him; there was just something about him that Mary neither liked nor trusted.<br> <br>Josh Powell often exaggerated or told outright lies. Susan was so thrilled with her new romance that it never occurred to her to check out some of the things he said. He told Susan and her parents that he had a degree in business administration from the University of Washington. But he complained about his professors, saying that he knew more than any of them did.<br> <br>Years later, when Nate Carlisle, a Salt Lake City reporter, attempted to verify Josh&#x2019;s degree from the University of Washington, he found there was no record of it. Josh countered by saying he was on a &#x201c;special list.&#x201d; That was a lie, but he would never admit it.<br> <br>Susan wanted to marry and have a family; her parents had been young when they wed and she had never known anything but a happy home. She was in love with love. When she looked at Josh, she was impressed that he had a job, his own apartment, and his own car. She either didn&#x2019;t know that he&#x2019;d lived with his father, Steven Powell, until he was twenty-six&#x2014;just before they started dating&#x2014;or it didn&#x2019;t seem important.<br> <br>To her, Josh seemed stable and ready to settle down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Josh wasn&#x2019;t stable,&#x201d; Chuck Cox says. &#x201c;After ten minutes, anyone could see there was something wrong with him. He talked all the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>And it was mostly about himself. He was a braggart, and Susan&#x2019;s parents didn&#x2019;t agree with her that all he needed was love. And then he proposed to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried to tell her that you don&#x2019;t marry a &#x2018;project.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Judy Cox and Susan&#x2019;s friends threw a bridal shower for her. There weren&#x2019;t many there&#x2014;only her friends Rachel, Terry, Jody, and Josh&#x2019;s sisters Alina and Jennifer. All of a sudden, another person walked into the room. They were all shocked to see that it was Josh. He was wearing a skirt, and lots of makeup, all dressed up as a female.<br> <br>&#x201c;He wanted to attend the girls&#x2019; bridal shower, and be in the spotlight,&#x201d; Judy recalls. &#x201c;It was really odd and embarras...</p><h2>The Fables of Aesop (Dover Children&#39;s Evergreen Classics)</h2><p><p><i>The gods help them that help themselves </i>. . . <i>We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified </i>. . . <i>Appearances are deceptive </i>. . .

In neon-colored dresses, tights, and balaclavas, they performed a &#x201c;punk prayer&#x201d; beseeching the &#x201c;Mother of God&#x201d; to &#x201c;get rid of Putin.&#x201d; They were quickly shut down by security, and in the weeks and months that followed, three of the women were arrested and tried, and two were sentenced to a remote prison colony. But the incident captured international headlines, and footage of it went viral. People across the globe recognized not only a fierce act of political confrontation but also an inspired work of art that, in a time and place saturated with lies, found a new way to speak the truth.<br><br>Masha Gessen&#x2019;s riveting account tells how such a phenomenon came about. Drawing on her exclusive, extensive access to the members of Pussy Riot and their families and associates, she reconstructs the fascinating personal journeys that transformed a group of young women into artists with a shared vision, gave them the courage and imagination to express it unforgettably, and endowed them with the strength to endure the devastating loneliness and isolation that have been the price of their triumph.</p><p><b>Masha Gessen </b>is a Russian-American journalist who is the author of several books, most recently the national bestseller <i>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin</i>. Her work has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and many other&nbsp;publications, and has received numerous awards, most recently the 2013 Media for Liberty Award. She has served as the editor of several publications and as director of Radio Liberty&#x2019;s Russia Service. She lives in New York.&#x201c;It is worth noting,&#x201d; Nadya said, lecturing at a conference, &#x201c;that punk feminist art is being produced in Russia today. Here is an example,&#x201d; she continued, improvising. &#x201c;The Pisya Riot collective works in a great variety of genres, including both visual and musical compositions.&#x201d;<p><i>Pisya</i> is a kid&#x2019;s word for genitals of either sex; it is most like &#x201c;wee-wee&#x201d; or &#x201c;pee-pee.&#x201d;</p><p>Being a fictional group, Pisya Riot could not write its own music. Neither of the real-life members of the phantom group could; Nadya had taken music lessons as a child and had not done well, and Kat had no musical background. So they borrowed a track from the British punk group Cockney Rejects and used a handheld Dictaphone to record their lyrics over the sampling:</p><i>You are sick and tired of stinky socks,</i><p><i>Your daddy&#x2019;s stinky socks.</i></p><p><i>Your entire life will be stinky socks.</i></p><p><i>Your mother is all in dirty dishes,</i></p><p><i>Stinky food remains in dirty dishes.</i></p><p><i>Using refried chicken to wash the floor,</i></p><p><i>Your mother lives in a prison.</i></p><p><i>In prison she&#x2019;s washing pots like a sucker.</i></p><p><i>No freedom to be had in prison.</i></p><p><i>Life from hell where man is the master.</i></p><p><i>Come out in the street and free the women!</i></p><p><i>Suck on your own stinky socks,</i></p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t forget to scratch your ass while you&#x2019;re at it,</i></p><p><i>Burp, spit, drink, shit,</i></p><p><i>While we happily become lesbians!</i></p><p><i>Envy your own stupid penis</i></p><p><i>Or your drinking buddy&#x2019;s huge dick,</i></p><p><i>Or the guy on TV&#x2019;s huge dick,</i></p><p><i>While shit piles up and rises to the ceiling.</i></p><p><i>Become a feminist, become a feminist</i></p><p><i>Peace to the world and death to the men.</i></p><p><i>Become a feminist, kill the sexist!</i></p><p><i>Kill the sexist and wash off his blood.</i></p><p><i>Become a feminist, kill the sexist!</i></p><p><i>Kill the sexist and wash off his blood.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They found they liked being Pisya Riot. Maybe they even really wanted to be Pisya Riot. To become a punk rock group, though, they would need musicians. They thought of N, a woman Nadya&#x2019;s age who had come to Voina, an art group to which Nadya and her husband, Petya, had belonged. Nadya sought her out. N found Nadya changed: &#x201c;In Voina, she had been this chubby-cheeked child, and now her cheeks had thinned and her voice took on a certainty. She had chosen her issues, and she may even have chosen them at random, but now she was serious and her topics were LGBT and feminism. And the choice had changed her: she no longer saw herself as an appendage to Petya and [fellow Voina member] Vorotnikov, even if she had once been a willing appendage. It had still limited her. When you are with someone, you are not flying through the cosmos, because your soul always has its home in another person&#x2014;you may need it sometimes, but it is limiting and it keeps you from taking flight. Nadya got this at some point and took flight.&#x201d; Pisya Riot, on the other hand, seemed to N almost pure silliness, but she envied whatever it was Nadya felt. She took on the music.</p><p>They would need other participants too, but that did not seem like a big issue; what they had in mind could be done by three or five or seven or eleven people, and there were friends and students to be recruited. They also needed a stage. At first, playgrounds, with their platforms and slides, looked pretty good. They had recorded &#x201c;Kill the Sexist&#x201d; at a playground. It was raining. It was also night time, which meant there were no children at the playground, but there were beer-drinking and cigarette-smoking young people, who grew concerned when they heard young women screaming their heads off about stinky socks.</p><p>They said, &#x201c;What happened? Did someone hurt you? Do you need help? &#x201d;</p><p>Nadya and Kat had said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, we are just making a record.&#x201d; But now that they were planning on making videos, they needed a different stage, something more spectacular. One day, as they got off the Metro, they spotted it: some stations had towers made of scaffolding, with platforms at the very top, for changing light bulbs or painting ceilings, or performing punk rock, perhaps. Moscow Metro stations are, for the most part, grand architectural affairs, all marble and granite and ostentatiously spanning arches and dramatic lighting; they look like classical concert halls, and the crude scaffolding towers, viewed from the right angle, look very much like a punk affront of a stage.</p><p>They performed a number of reconnaissance missions and identified several stations where the towers were particularly tall and well placed, which is to say, placed close to the center of the hall. Then they began rehearsing. If they were going to be a feminist punk rock group, they were going to have to have instruments&#x2014;Kat picked up a bass&#x2014;and they were going to have to climb up the tower and unpack their instruments and mics and amplifier and take up positions fast, faster than the Metro police knew what was happening.</p><p>They practiced at playgrounds.</p><p>As they rehearsed, it became clear they needed staging and visuals and costumes. &#x201c;Because if we just got up there and started screaming, everyone would think we were stupid,&#x201d; Kat explained to me. &#x201c;Stupid chicks just standing there screaming.&#x201d;</p><p>First they came up with wearing balaclavas, which would make them anonymous&#x2014;but not like Russian special forces, who kept their identities hidden behind black knit face masks with slits for the eyes and mouth, but like the opposite of that: their balaclavas would be neon-colored. Then they would need dresses and multicolored stockings, to show that the whole getup was intentional. Bright, exaggerated makeup showed surprisingly well through the slits in the balaclavas. And the pillow&#x2014;the pillow appeared because parliament members had begun talking about banning abortion and Putin kept talking about Russia&#x2019;s so-called demographic problem, by which he meant that Russian women were not getting pregnant often enough, and so Nadya stuck a pillow under her green dress. And then she tried taking it out during the screaming, or the singing, and ripping it open. The feathers created a sort of snow effect, in addition to the birth effect and the abortion effect. That worked.</p><p>They spent a month filming their first clip. There was one time they climbed atop a Moscow electric bus and performed&#x2014;it turned out the feather-letting worked outdoors as well&#x2014;but mostly they filmed at Metro stations, as many as fifteen of them in all. A couple of times, they got detained. Once, Tasya, who was filming, got beaten up by police. This was before many Russians came to think of being beaten up by police as a regular part of their existence. There was the time when the police tried to beat up Petya, and Nadya wedged herself between him and them and literally shielded him with her body, and there was probably no one, not even Nadya, who appreciated the beauty of her doing this after screaming about stinky socks and penis envy.</p><p>And there was the time when the police called Kat&#x2019;s father, Stanislav Samutsevich. &#x201c;They would not let me see them,&#x201d; he recalled. &#x201c;They were in a holding pen. I had a conversation with two interesting young men. They talked to me about contemporary art and activism. I asked them who they were, and they said, &#x2018;We are art critics in civilian clothing.&#x2019; &#x201c; It was an unfunny joke that Stanislav Samutsevich did not get: &#x201c;art critic in civilian clothing&#x201d; was a term used to denote KGB agents whose job it was to inform on dissidents in the Soviet Union; just like their predecessors in the 1970s, Pisya Riot had developed a following among these &#x201c;art critics&#x201d; before the broader public ever heard of them. That is, the secret police had literally started following them around&#x2014;there were more of them with each consecutive taping.</p><p>Stanislav Samutsevich would not have known, or wanted to know, anything about dissidents in the Soviet Union, or about those whose job it had been to spy on them or jail them. &#x201c;So I shared with them my views on contemporary art.&#x201d; What were they? &#x201c;Well, I am an old man.&#x201d; The ones in civilian clothing were more knowledgeable about contemporary art. &#x201c;The girls had really wreaked havoc there and the police didn&#x2019;t know what to do with them. Then a big police vehicle came for them and Yekaterina told me to go home. She came home later, on the last train. I had a talk with her after that, but I am a dinosaur and I don&#x2019;t understand anything about anything, so that was the last time she ever told me anything.&#x201d; From that point on, Stanislav Samutsevich learned about performances from the media&#x2014;or from police. He did try to protect the girls from themselves. &#x201c;One time they were in the hallway, painting posters of some sort, and I came out and said to them, &#x2018;Look, you&#x2019;ve already been to the police station once, and no one knows how things could end.&#x2019; Nadya stopped coming over to the house after that.&#x201d;</p><p>After that particular detention, the media got wind of the tower climbing and the screaming and the feathers flying in the Metro. They assumed Voina was back in action. Petya and Nadya were invited to the studios of the lone independent cable television channel. They denied it had been a Voina action. They said they had been detained while attending a performance of a new, different art group. They said it was called Pussy Riot.</p></p><h2>The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Epics)</h2><p>A great king, strong as the stars in Heaven.

With the widespread alarm over food quality in recent years, and with the growth of the organic movement and its mainstream acceptance, perceptions are changing. The qualitative aspect of food is on the agenda again, and in this context Steiner&#x2019;s only course of lectures on agriculture is critical to the current debate. <br><br>With these talks, Steiner created and launched &#x201c;biodynamic&#x201d; farming&#x2015;a form of agriculture that has come to be regarded as the best organically produced food. However, the agriculture Steiner speaks of here is much more than organic&#x2015;it involves working with the cosmos, with the earth, and with spiritual beings. To facilitate this, Steiner prescribes specific &#x201c;preparations&#x201d; for the soil, as well as other distinct methods born from his profound understanding of the material and spiritual worlds. He presents a comprehensive picture of the complex dynamic relationships at work in nature and gives basic indications of the practical measures needed to bring them into full play. <br><br>These lectures are reprinted here in the &#x201c;classic&#x201d; translation made by Rudolf Steiner's English interpreter, George Adams. This edition also features a preface by Steiner's colleague the medical doctor Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, as well as eight color plates. <br><br>This is the course that began the biodynamic movement. Rudolf Steiner's <i>Agriculture Course</i> is the essential work for anyone wanting to understand and use Steiner's methods of food production.<br><br>This book is a translation from German of <i>Geisteswissenschaftliche Grundlagen zum Gedeihen der Landwirtschaft. Landwirtschaftlicher Kursus</i> (GA 327).</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West (Bison Book S)</h2><p>In 1822, before Jedediah Smith entered the West, it was largely an unknown land, &#x201c;a wilderness,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;of two thousand miles diameter.&#x201d; During his nine years as a trapper for Ashley and Henry and later for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, &#x201c;the mild and Christian young man&#x201d; blazed the trail westward through South Pass; he was the first to go from the Missouri overland to California, the first to cross the length of Utah and the width of Nevada, first to travel by land up through California and Oregon, first to cross the Sierra Nevada.

While the "Prayer to God" is based on the Lord's Prayer, the "Prayer to Christ" is inspired by ardent private emotion and other prayers invest saints with individual attributes, with John the Baptist as the friend, Peter as the shepherd and Mary Magdalene as the forgiving lover, among many others. The meditations include a searching exploration of the state of the soul and a lament on the loss of purity, and the Proslogion discusses the mysteries of faith.

Robb, has teamed with three other gifted writers of romantic suspense to produce four intriguing tales of holiday upheaval. Claire Cross's "A Berry Merry Christmas" sends Holly Berry, a technophobic elf, to spread a little Christmas cheer to orphaned Natalie Sinclair and her Uncle Drew. When Natalie requests a new mommy for Christmas, little does Holly suspect she's the ideal candidate to fill the role--and to become a loving wife to Drew, who finds himself believing once again in the magic of Christmas. Only Santa Claus--"Mr. C" to Holly--can make all their dreams come true. <p> In Dee Holmes's "The Unexpected Gift," Sabrina McKay is spending her first Christmas since her divorce alone in Pine Falls, Vermont, with her young son. She finds the best gift of all not under her Christmas tree but passed out cold in her front yard. Investigating her son's report that "there's a dead man in the yard," Sabrina discovers former bad boy--and her girlhood boyfriend--Zach Danforth. Together again, they realize the true meaning of Christmas and the rediscovery of a love never lost. </p><p> Jake Rimsa discovers that the packaging doesn't reveal the true value of the gift inside in Susan Plunkett's <i>Christmas Promises</i>. Roped into giving Marne York, his ex-fianc�e, a ride home for Christmas, Jake finds little evidence of the polished, pampered, starry-eyed young woman he left behind when he joined the FBI. Instead Marne has become a fierce advocate on behalf of battered women and a woman who has learned, in the most horrifying way possible, to take care of herself. And Jake uncovers in Marne the long-buried passion she believed forever dead. Together they seek a foe determined to make Marne pay for her interference, and they find the greatest gift of all--love between equals. </p><p> In the final story, only Nora Roberts can combine Christmas and an escaped serial killer with a grudge and still make it sizzle! Lieutenant Eve Dallas returns in <i>Midnight in Death</i>. When her first Christmas with her new husband Roarke is interrupted by reports of the naked, mutilated body of the judge responsible for convicting serial killer David Palmer, Eve learns that her name appears on the list of others to be killed. Since she was responsible for arresting Palmer the first time, Eve is back on the case. But Roarke is on her case, exhorting Eve to join him under the mistletoe for a little Yuletide cheer and to let him bring his considerable connections to bear to locate the hiding place of the monster threatening their happiness. Together they capture the psychopath and the spirit of Christmas. What a way to start the new year! <i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p><b>J. D.

Her lips were pressed<br>tight shut, and she&#x2019;d shrunk back into her loose-knit poncho.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, I am!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a resigned sigh, the superintendent turned back into the hallway. Holding a yellowed black-and-white photograph between his right thumb and index finger, he paced the room, pausing deliberately before each window. Finally he stopped in front of a particular one, checking the view against the photo. The foggy gray February morning had softened the edges of everything outside, but he could tell that the photo had been taken from this very spot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newly planted birch was barely visible on the left-hand side of the photo. As he peered through the transom window, he found himself looking directly into the crown of a fullgrown tree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked ponderously back to the woman at her desk. He hesitated, then loudly cleared his throat. &#x201c;Well, Nurse Siv, you can certainly understand my difficulty here.&#x201d; Her ash-gray face turned toward him. &#x201c;It was that nurse I saw.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, for . . . !&#x201d;He swallowed the curse. &#x201c;The woman in this photo has been dead for fifty years!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I know. But it was her!&#x201d;<br><br>Chapter 1<br><br>The nightnurse, Siv Persson, had just stepped into the hallway when the lights went out. The street lamps outside spread a weak glow through the tall windows, but not enough to light up the hall. It appeared that only the hospital had lost power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse stopped short and spoke aloud into the darkness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;My flashlight!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hesitantly, she returned to the nurses&#x2019; station. With help from the streetlamps, she fumbled for the desk chair and sank down into it. She jumped, startled, when the respirator alarm went off in the small intensive-care unit. The sound was dampened by the solid double doors that isolated the unit, but the alarm still pierced the silence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her station she cast a practiced glance along the hallway and screamed. A dark shadow loomed in the door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only me,&#x201d; came the doctor&#x2019;s exasperated voice. Nurse Persson jumped up from her chair. Without another word, the doctor rushed down the hallway to the ICU; the nurse followed him, using his fluttering white coat like a beacon in the dark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the ICU the sound was deafening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Marianne! Turn off the alarm!&#x201d; the doctor shouted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no answer from the ICU nurse who was supposed to be on duty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Siv. Find a flashlight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurse Siv said weakly, &#x201c;I . . . forgot my flashlight when I was here helping Marianne turn Mr. Peterz�n. It must be underneath the examination cart.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Go get it!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fumbled her way back toward the door. Her fingers rooted around in the darkness until they knocked against a hard plastic case. She pulled the case out and headed back in the direction of the doctor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand on her arm made her jump. He grabbed the case from her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this? The emergency kit? How can we use that when we can&#x2019;t see?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Look inside. The bag-valve mask and a laryngoscope are in there,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;The laryngoscope is powered up, and you can use its light.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor muttered to himself as he opened the case. After some searching he found the lamp for guiding a breathing tube into the pharynx of anesthetized or unconscious patients. He clicked it open and shone the narrow beam of bright light<br>toward the old man lying in the bed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that they could orient themselves, Nurse Siv stepped toward the respirator by the bed and shut off the alarm. The silence echoed in their heads. They heard the sound of their own breathing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;His heart&#x2019;s stopped. Where is Marianne? Marianne!&#x201d; the doctor shouted. He placed the ventilator mask over the patient&#x2019;s nose and mouth. &#x201c;Take care of his breathing while I do CPR,&#x201d; he hissed through tight lips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siv began to pump air into the unmoving lungs. The doctor pressed down on the man&#x2019;s breastbone, his palms rhythmically trying to stimulate the silent heart. They did not speak while they worked. The doctor took a minute to inject epinephrine directly into the heart muscle. It was no use. The heart would not resume beating. Finally they were forced to give up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t work, damn it. Where is Marianne? And why hasn&#x2019;t the backup generator turned on?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the doctor flashed the light of the laryngoscope around the room, Nurse Siv glimpsed the examination cart. She stepped carefully toward it, her arm out stiffly, hip high. She moved her right hand along the top of the cart, over the examination instruments and plastic gloves. Finally she found the barrel of her flashlight and turned it on.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beam of light struck the doctor right between the eyes, and he threw up his hands with a muffled curse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Uh . . . sorry,&#x201d; Siv stammered. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize where you were.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Okay, okay. I&#x2019;m just glad you found a working flashlight. Check out the floor. See if she&#x2019;s here. Maybe she&#x2019;s fainted.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ICU nurse was not to be found anywhere in the small ICU.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beam of the flashlight caught a phone, and the doctor strode to it and lifted the receiver. &#x201c;Dead as a doornail.&#x201d; After thinking a moment, he said, &#x201c;My cell phone is in the on-call apartment. Let me take the flashlight up there to call emergency<br>services. Then I&#x2019;ll start searching for Marianne. You didn&#x2019;t see her go past your station, did you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No. I haven&#x2019;t seen her since eleven this evening, when we were in here turning Mr. Peterz�n.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So she must have gone out the back door. I&#x2019;ll go that way to the on-call apartment and walk upstairs through the operating rooms. That&#x2019;s the closest.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor swung the beam toward the door. Beyond it were the stairs and the elevator to surgery, one floor up. One floor down, on the ground floor, were the polyclinic and physical therapy rooms; one floor below that was the basement, where the X-ray suite, employee changing rooms, and building machinery were located. The hospital was a large area to search, but Surgical Chief of Medicine Dr. L�wander was<br>the person who knew its layout the best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurse Siv was left alone in the dark. Her legs trembled slightly as she made her way back down the hall to the nurses&#x2019; station. Out of habit she glanced through the ward door&#x2019;s window. A bone-white moon augmented the mild glow from the street lamps outside. In the cold light from the windows, she could see a woman moving in the stairwell, her back to the nurses&#x2019; station. The woman&#x2019;s white collar glowed against the<br>dark fabric of her calf-length dress. Her blond hair was pinned back severely, and above it she wore a starched nurse&#x2019;s cap.<br>&nbsp;<br>Chapter 2<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Sverker L�wander paused on the other side of the ICU door. He let the beam of his flashlight play over the stairwell. Nothing. Rapidly, he climbed the stairs to the top<br>floor and stopped again up there to shine his beam around the landing outside surgery. Everything appeared normal. Two rolling beds were parked next to the closet to his left. He went to the elevator shaft and shone his light through the window. As he aimed the beam down, he could see the top of the elevator just below him. He pulled out his key chain, which jingled as he searched for the master key.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the door to surgery, everything was still. The smell of disinfectant stung his nose. The doctor made a quick pass through the two anterooms and decided that all was as it should be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurried through the surgery ward and opened the door to the other, somewhat smaller, stairwell. At the administration offices on the other side of the stairs, Dr. L�wander tested the doors to the house mother&#x2019;s station, the doctors&#x2019; assistants&#x2019; offices, and his own office. He felt relief to find them all locked. The last door in the hallway belonged to the on-call apartment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed inside, snatched his cell phone from his briefcase, and tapped 112, his hands shaking slightly. The emergency- services operator promised to send a police car as soon as possible. They would also contact the emergency electric service but made no promises about when an electrician couldget there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. L�wander held the flashlight in his teeth to search through the phone book, which, luckily, was on his desktop. He flipped through the Bengtssons of G�teborg until he got to Folke Bengtsson, security guard, Solrosgatan 45. He had to describe the situation first to the newly awakened Mrs. Bengtsson and then again to Folke Bengtsson himself. Folke promised to jump into his car right away. As Dr. L�wander pressed end, he found he was covered in sweat. He took a few deep breaths before heading back out into the hallway and down the steps as quickly as he dared. He slowed as he got to the ward and carefully opened the door to the darkened room. Nurse Siv was sitting on the floor outside the nurses&#x2019; station, crying softly. She&#x2019;d wrapped her arms tightly across her body, and she was rocking back and forth. When she saw the doctor, she began to wail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I saw her! I saw her!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; the doctor asked, more sharply than he&#x2019;d intended.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The ghost! Nurse Tekla!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused, Dr L�wander gaped at the nurse, who continued rocking and shut her eyes against the bright glare of the flashlight. Tears ran down her face. He pondered what to do. Finally he said, &#x201c;Here. Take the flashlight. Sit here at the station. I&#x2019;ll<br>come back with the police. We&#x2019;ll find out what&#x2019;s at the bottom of all this.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped the shaking woman to her feet, pushed the flashlight into her hand, and led her back to the nurses&#x2019; station and to her desk. Unresisting, she let him push her into her chair. Now that the moonlight was stronger, Dr. L�wander was able to find his way much more easily down the stairs to the ground floor. Once he reached the foyer, he had to slow his pace. The darkness among the pillars of the art nouveau arches was impenetrable. As he got to the main door, a chill went down his spine. He was certain that someone was watching him. He felt as if a person were standing amid the pillars observing his every move. His fingers fumbled with the key. He almost yelled with relief as the heavy door swung open. The chill of the night swept across his sweaty forehead, and he took a deep breath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve searched the entire upper floor, and there&#x2019;s no trace of Marianne.&#x201d; Dr. L�wander filled the police in, trying to speed their search for the nurse. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not on the middle floor either. That&#x2019;s where the care wards and ICU are located. Probably<br>she&#x2019;s here on the ground floor or even in the basement. If she hasn&#x2019;t gone outside into the park, that is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security guard Bengtsson had brought his own flashlight. Dr. L�wander had already sent him to the basement to check on what had happened with the electricity and the backup generator.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three policemen had brought strong flashlights as well. The oldest, who had introduced himself as Sergeant Kent Karlsson, swung the beam of his around the large, dark foyer. Dr. L�wander felt slightly irritated with himself; there was clearly no one hiding among the pillars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;If you loan us your keys, Jonsson and I could make a round through this floor and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey there! Help! I found her!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A call from the basement interrupted the sergeant. They could see the wavering glow of his flashlight before the full beam blinded them and obscured the guard. Nevertheless, his excited words were clear: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found Nurse Marianne!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Dr. L�wander asked sharply.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;In the main electrical room. I believe . . . I believe she&#x2019;s . . . dead.&#x201d; Bengtsson&#x2019;s voice was failing, and the word &#x201c;dead&#x201d; was nothing more than a hoarse whisper echoing among the pillars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Show us where you found her,&#x201d; Sergeant Karlsson ordered.<br>Her body wa s stretched facedown across the backup generator. The men standing in the doorway could just see the backs of her legs and her rear, encased in long pants. Her head and arms were out of sight over the other side. Dr. L�wander registered that she was missing a shoe. He walked around the generator, bent down, and dutifully checked the pulse at her neck, but he could feel that the chill of death had already set<br>in. Her thick, dark braid brushed the floor. A sharp bluish red mark ran across her throat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; he said quietly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Karlsson took charge. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving the room now. Do not touch anything. I have to call for reinforcements.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. L�wander nodded and obediently left with the others.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get back to Nurse Siv. She&#x2019;s all alone,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Karlsson looked at him with surprise. &#x201c;Night nurses are used to being alone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;True enough, but not under these circumstances. She&#x2019;s in shock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She believes she saw a ghost.&#x201d; Dr. L�wander said this lightly, hoping that the police would not pay too much attention to it. He quickly turned to Bengtsson and said, &#x201c;Come with me. Let&#x2019;s check on Siv.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Bengtsson&#x2019;s flashlight and led the way to the stairs. Folke Bengtsson followed him with relief.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At seven o&#x2019; clock, Superintendent Sven Andersson and Detective Inspector Irene Huss arrived at L�wander Hospital.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigators climbed out of their blue Volvo, which the superintendent had parked by the main entrance. They paused for a moment and looked up at the impressive building. The hospital was built of brownish red brick. The entrance led to a grand stairway right at the center of the structure. The main entrance was covered with stucco decorations. Two carved marble Greek gods kept watch on each side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pushed open the heavy door. Detective Fredrik Stridh was sitting in a chair by the entrance, waiting for them. They knew he was not sitting to rest tired legs but was taking the opportunity to write up his notes. When he saw them, he leaped to his feet and came to meet them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; Superintendent Andersson said to his youngest detective.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Morning, sir!&#x201d; Stridh eagerly launched into his report.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The crime scene was secured by the patrol, and the technicians were already hard at work when I arrived at three-thirty a.m. Malm is here from Forensics, and he says it appears t...</p><h2>Tumbleweeds: A Novel</h2><p>Recently orphaned, eleven-year-old Cathy Benson feels she has been dropped into a cultural and intellectual wasteland when she is forced to move from her academically privileged life in California to the small town of Kersey in the Texas Panhandle where the sport of football reigns supreme.

Yet often, people are not aware of the full range of choices available to them. The goal of this book is to offer information on a variety of approaches that will help you create and maintain vibrant good health. The authors believe in an integrated approach to health care that considers all treatment possibilities and draws on what works. Sometimes this will be an herb, sometimes an antibiotic, sometimes both. We believe it is just as significant that a particular therapy has been used effectively for hundreds or thousands of years as it is that a scientific paper substantiates a particular approach. Taking advantage of one form of knowledge does not necessarily preclude using another.</p><p>This book outlines and describes the application of conventional medicine, dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and acupressure. We believe that understanding and integrating the full range of health-care options offers the most complete and responsible way to a healthy life. We hope to foster an awareness that natural healing therapies and conventional medical treatment, two apparently divergent approaches, can&#x2014;and should&#x2014;work together.</p><p>Natural healing sciences (including herbal medicine, homeopathy, diet, nutritional supplements, and acupressure) are sometimes called &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; medicine. As that name implies, natural medicine and conventional medicine can be used to complement and support each other in helping to create health. Complementary medicine is gaining increasing acceptance in the United States, as evidenced by the many multidisciplinary clinics in which medical doctors, naturopathic physicians, acupuncturists, nutritionists, homeopaths, chiropractors, and counselors work together in an integrated manner, treating the patient as a whole person. Even the United States government has taken notice of these developments. In the fall of 1992, the Office of Alternative Medicine was established at the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of various types of alternative health care. Among the subjects being studied there are homeopathy, acupuncture and acupressure, herbal medicine, reflexology, chiropractic, biofeedback, hypnosis, and relaxation and visualization techniques.</p><p>Natural healing systems are much more widely used than many people suppose. The World Health Organization, established in 1948 as a specialized agency of the United Nations, reports that 80 percent of the world&#x2019;s population relies on natural healing as their primary form of health care. And in 1997, according to an article in <i>The New York Times</i>, 42 percent of Americans tried some form of alternative treatment. In fact, more visits were made to alternative-care practitioners in that year than to primary-care physicians, even though most of these visits were not covered by health insurance and had to be paid for out of pocket.</p><p>More and more medical doctors are recognizing the safety and effectiveness of natural medicines. There are physicians who prescribe herbal medicines and homeopathic remedies; many more recommend dietary changes for their patients. By now, a clear link has been established between diet and health. The American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and the United States government have all published dietary guidelines to promote health. Conventional and complementary health-care practitioners alike emphasize the role of nutrition as fundamental to the healing process. Indeed, a 1988 report of the Surgeon General of the United States found that two-thirds of all deaths in this country are nutrition related.</p><p>Homeopathy is an accepted form of medical practice in many parts of the world. Generation after generation of Asian families have turned to acupuncture and acupressure for relief of illness. Even modern pharmacology has deep roots in herbal medicine. The use of the herb ma huang (ephedra), for example, dates back several thousand years; ephedrine, one of its primary ingredients (and pseudoephedrine, a synthetic version of it) is used by pharmaceutical companies today in many over-the-counter cold and allergy medicines.</p><p>&#x201c;The physician treats, but nature heals.&#x201d; This is an often-quoted saying from Hippocrates&#x2014;known as the &#x201c;Father of Medicine&#x201d;&#x2014;who recognized that the body has a natural tendency toward health and vitality. To nurture this tendency, we need to treat illness in ways that support and strengthen the body&#x2019;s natural processes. Using a complementary approach to health care, we can draw on modern conventional medicine, natural medicine, and ancient healing traditions to find what is most effective and supportive in curing and preventing illness.</p><p>Conventional medicine generally works with drugs or surgery to suppress or correct a specific condition. And sometimes, that is exactly what is needed. At other times, however, a natural medical approach makes more sense. Natural medicine works by supporting the body in healing itself. While antibiotics can be used to kill harmful bacteria, for example, the herbs echinacea and goldenseal boost the immune system so that the body is better able to resist or fight infection on its own. These herbs strengthen and support the body in its ability to defend itself against bacterial invasion.</p><p>When you are suffering from a cold, you can choose to take over-the-counter or prescription medications, such as decongestants or cough medicines, to suppress the symptoms. However, cold medicines can cause side effects, and they do little to strengthen the immune system or address the underlying reason for the cold. Some commonly used ingredients in cold medications can cause restlessness, insomnia, drowsiness, or headaches. And there is nothing in these products that can actually <i>cure</i> the cold. In contrast, when a cold is treated with herbs to soothe the respiratory tract and boost the immune system, homeopathy to ease the discomforts and prevent recurrences, acupressure to open blocked energy channels, and soups and teas to maintain adequate hydration, the body is supported and strengthened as it works to restore health. For many of the illnesses that afflict us, natural medicine is gentle, effective, and safe. It is an important way to work with the body&#x2019;s ability to heal itself.</p><p>In his book <i>Health and Healing</i> (Houghton Mifflin, 1988), Dr. Andrew Weil wrote, &#x201c;The only prerequisite for learning to take responsibility for one&#x2019;s own health is to discard concepts that stand in the way and adopt more useful ones.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyone who comes to see healing as an innate capacity of the body, rather than something to be sought outside, will gain greater power over the fluctuations of health and illness.&#x201d;</p><p>Being willing to accept responsibility is central to taking an integrated approach to health care. Develop greater faith in your body&#x2019;s ability to heal itself, when supported and nourished by natural medicines. When faced with illness, use this book to learn and understand the many options for care and healing. Observe how the natural and conventional medical treatments you choose affect your health and well-being. Be both responsible and willing to explore health-care options.</p><p>With the information in this book, you can learn to be an active participant in your health care. As you gain confidence and understanding in the use of natural healing systems, in concert with conventional medicine when necessary, you will gain greater confidence in optimizing health and minimizing illness. We invite you to discard the concept that health care is an either-or proposition. It&#x2019;s not. Integrated health care is a remarkably effective and exciting hands-on endeavor.</p><p>Using an integrated approach to health care will strengthen your capabilities. Taking care of yourself in this way will promote a healthy and responsible relationship between you and your health-care practitioner. Learn to pay attention to your body, and to appreciate your own uniqueness and vitality.</p><p>The human body is wonderfully responsive. When the body is supported with thoughtful integrated care, the best of natural and conventional medicine, it works quickly to attain full health. By giving nature a nudge&#x2014;by supporting, nurturing, and nourishing the body&#x2019;s capacity to heal itself&#x2014;you can help yourself achieve vibrant good health.</p><p><i>How to Use This Book</i></p><p>This is an in-home guide that will help you maintain your health through a unique approach that seeks to combine the best of conventional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, acupressure, diet, and nutritional supplementation. Written by a naturopathic physician, a medical doctor, and a registered pharmacist and naturopath, it offers advice and explanations of the full spectrum of options available today.</p><p>This book is intended to help you make informed health-care decisions. The information and suggestions presented here are meant to be used in conjunction with the services of a physician or other qualified health-care providers. This book is not meant to replace appropriate consultation with health-care practitioners, medical investigation or treatment, or emergency first-aid training by qualified professionals. In fact, we strongly suggest that everyone who is able to do so complete an emergency first-aid course that includes instruction in artificial respiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Then, should you ever be called upon to practice these techniques, the emergency instructions we provide will help you through the procedure.</p><p>The subjects in this book have been divided into three parts. Part One, The Elements of Health Care, discusses the basic history, theories, and practices of conventional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, Bach flower remedies, acupressure, and aromatherapy. It also covers issues in diet and nutrition, nutritional supplementation, and exercise.</p><p>Part Two, Common Health Problems, contains an alphabetic directory of common illnesses, and outlines the different kinds of treatments appropriate for each. Each entry begins with a discussion of the problem, its causes, and how to identify the signs and symptoms. Treatment options follow, including recommendations for emergency treatment, if appropriate, followed by information about conventional medical treatment, dietary guidelines, and information on nutritional supplementation, herbal treatment, homeopathy, Bach flower remedies, acupressure, and aromatherapy. Each entry also includes a section on general recommendations that gives a brief summary of the most commonly helpful natural treatments, plus a section on prevention.</p><p>Part Three, Therapies and Procedures, gives specific instructions to help you use the diagnostic and treatment procedures suggested in Part Two. The use of special diets, the preparation of herbal and aromatherapy treatments, the locations of acupressure points, and other techniques are explained and illustrated so that you will be able to take advantage of the various kinds of treatments available to you.</p><p>Also included, in an appendix, are a list of references; a glossary of some of the terms used in this book; a list of common medical abbreviations; a list of recommended suppliers of herbal, homeopathic, and nutritional products; a list of helpful resource organizations, with addresses and telephone numbers; and a bibliography for further reading.</p><p><i>Part One</i></p><p><i>The Elements of Health Care</i></p><p>The Nuts and Bolts of<br>Conventional and Natural Treatment</p><p><i>Introduction</i></p><p>Each of us plays an invaluable role in his or her wellness care. While you may rely on professionals to help you manage certain aspects of health care, the fact is that you yourself are the best judge of your own health. Building on the understanding you have of your body and how it functions, you can learn to move from general observation toward identifying the signs and symptoms that reveal an illness or other health problem. Even having a vague sense that something is just &#x201c;not quite right&#x201d; is valid and important. You know your body. You know when something is wrong.</p><p>When we are ill, we want to ease the discomfort quickly and effectively. But conventional and natural therapies alike can seem confusing and overwhelming, just when they are needed most. The approaches to medicine covered in this book include conventional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, acupressure, nutritional supplements, and diet. In Part One you will find historical information, tables, diagrams, and guidelines to help you understand each system of medicine from a conceptual and practical perspective.</p><p>Each of the healing systems offers advantages and benefits. Each has drawbacks. This section provides a clear, unbiased look at all protocols. It will help you gain the insight you need to choose an effective course of action and become confident in your ability to provide yourself with effective, comforting, and gentle health care.</p><p><i>Conventional Medicine</i></p><p>When most Americans think of health care, they think of conventional medicine. It is without question the dominant approach to medicine in the United States today, and it permeates (often without our being aware of it) even our basic understanding of sickness and health. For example, many people think of health as being the absence of disease, and when they don&#x2019;t feel well, they are apt to ask, &#x201c;Is there something I can take for this?&#x201d; Both of these ideas reflect the assumptions of modern conventional medicine, which tends to be oriented toward identifying diseases and prescribing cures, usually in the form of drugs.</p><p>THE HISTORY OF CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE</p><p>The story of the development of the conventional medical science we know today weaves through many centuries and many cultures. If we go back to the dawn of history, we find that the earliest doctors were shamans, and the first medicines were plants.</p><p>It is generally accepted that the history of today&#x2019;s conventional medical science starts with Hippocrates, the Greek physician revered as the &#x201c;Father of Medicine.&#x201d; Up to the time of Hippocrates (c. 460&#x2013;370 B.C.E.), illness was believed to be caused by supernatural forces. Hippocrates taught that all disease was of earthly origin, not visited upon the sufferer by some wrathful god.</p><p>It was Hippocrates who set the stage for the scientific procedures of today. He began the practice of bedside observation. He listened to and recorded each patient&#x2019;s story&#x2014;today, we would call it a case history&#x2014;and considered the effects of diet, emotion, occupation, even climate, in his diagnosis and treatment. Through careful observation and logical reasoning, Hippocrates showed that it was possible to determine the cause of illness, and thereby discern the cure.</p><p>Hippocrates believed that health was the result of good balance between a person&#x2019;s internal nature and external environment. Illness indicated an imbalance. To restore balance in his patients, Hippocrates designed special diets, mandated exercise, and prescribed botanical medicines, including an occasional purgative or emetic. For digestive troubles (possibly stomach ulcers), he ordered bland drinks. Hippocrates also recognized the importance of stress reduction. He was known to have recommended to certain patients that they relocate to calmer surroundings, or that they take a glass of wine with supper.</p></p><h2>Southern Mail</h2><p>In his first novel, Saint-Exup�ry pays homage to &#x201c;those elemental divinities-night, day, mountain, sea, and storm,&#x201d; turning an account of a routine mail flight from France to North Africa into an epic rendering of the pioneer days of commercial aviation. The book is also a poignant reminiscence of a tragic affair, in which the uncertainties of love and flight enhance the mystery of one another. Translated by Curtis Cate.<br></p><p><p>ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUP�RY, the "Winged Poet," was born in Lyon, France, in 1900.&nbsp;A pilot at twenty-six, he was a pioneer of commercial aviation and flew in the Spanish Civil War and World War II.

In 1944, while flying a reconnaissance mission for his French air squadron, he disappeared over the Mediterranean. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Nobel Prize Women in Science: Their Lives, Struggles, and Momentous Discoveries: Second Edition</h2><p><p>Since 1901 there have been over three hundred recipients of the Nobel Prize in the sciences. Only ten of them -- about 3 percent -- have been women. Why? In this updated version of <em>Nobel Prize Women in Science</em>, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores the reasons for this astonishing disparity by examining the lives and achievements of fifteen women scientists who either won a Nobel Prize or played a crucial role in a Nobel Prize - winning project. The book reveals the relentless discrimination these women faced both as students and as researchers. Their success was due to the fact that they were passionately in love with science.<br> <br> The book begins with Marie Curie, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics. Readers are then introduced to Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, Emmy Noether, Lise Meitner, Barbara McClintock, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Rosalind Franklin. These and other remarkable women portrayed here struggled against gender discrimination, raised families, and became political and religious leaders. They were mountain climbers, musicians, seamstresses, and gourmet cooks. Above all, they were strong, joyful women in love with discovery.<br> <br> <b>Nobel Prize Women in Science</b> is a startling and revealing look into the history of science and the critical and inspiring role that women have played in the drama of scientific progress.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>1 A Passion for Discovery</li><li>2 Marie Sklodowska Curie</li><li>3 Lise Meitner</li><li>4 Emmy Noether</li><li>5 Gerty Radnitz Cori</li><li>6 Irene Joliot-Curie</li><li>7 Barbara McClintock</li><li>8 Maria Goeppert Mayer</li><li>9 Rita Levi-Montalcini</li><li>10 Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</li><li>11 Chien-Shiung Wu</li><li>12 Gertrude Belle Elion</li><li>13 Rosalind Elsie Franklin</li><li>14 Rosalyn Sussman Yalow</li><li>15 Jocelyn Bell Burnell</li><li>16 Christiane Nusslein-Volhard</li><li>Afterword</li><li>Notes</li><li>Picture Acknowledgments</li><li>Index</li><li>About the Author</li></ul></p><p>Sharon Bertsch McGrayne"...a welcome reissue of an important book on the lives and achievements of women science Nobel Laureates." -- <i>History of Physics Newsletter, Fall 2002</i></p><h2>The 9th Judgment (A Women&#39;s Murder Club Thriller, 9)</h2><p><b>The Women's Murder Club takes on two deranged killers, but Detective Lindsay Boxer begins to wonder if the mysterious case is also breaking apart her closest friendships.</b><b><br></b>During an intimate dinner party, a cat burglar breaks into the home of A-list actor Marcus Dowling.

Quintessential and quite the doyenne of the curd clan, lemon curd is unquestionably the all time favourite of these soft, creamy concoctions but I also love this smooth velvety apple curd. It's a marvelous way to use up windfall apples and so during the autumn I like to prepare a good quantity of apple puree and freeze it in 10 ounce portions. I can then easily knock up a batch when the apple season has long gone. --<em>Pam Corbin</em></p> <p><strong>Makes 4 8 ounce jars</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p>1 pound Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and chopped<br> Finely grated zest and juice of 2 unwaxed lemons (you need 7 tablespoons strained juice)<br> 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons beaten eggs (4 or 5 large eggs) <br></p> <p>Put the chopped apples into a pan with 7 tablespoons of water and the lemon zest. Cook gently until soft and fluffy, then either beat to a pur�e with a wooden spoon or run through a food mill.</p> <p>Put the lemon juice, butter, sugar, and apple pur�e into a double boiler or heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. As soon as the butter has melted and the mixture is hot and glossy, pour in the eggs through a sieve, then whisk with a balloon whisk. If the fruit pur�e is too hot when the beaten egg is added, the egg will curdle. One way to guard against this is to check the temperature of the pur�e with a candy thermometer &#x2013; it should be no higher than 130� to 140�F when the egg is added. If your curd does curdle, take the pan off the heat and whisk vigorously until smooth.</p> <p>Stir the mixture over low heat, scraping down the sides of the bowl every few minutes, until thick and creamy. This will take 9 to 10 minutes; the temperature should reach 180� to 183�F on a candy thermometer. Immediately pour into warm, sterilized jars and seal. Use within 1 month. Once opened, keep in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Variations</strong><br> To make gooseberry curd, replace the apples with gooseberries. If you&#x2019;d like a traditional, pure lemon curd, leave out the apples, increase the lemon juice to 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 to 5 lemons) and add the grated zest of 2 or 3 more lemons.</p> <br>PAM CORBIN has been making preserves for as long as she can remember, and for more than twenty years her passion has been her business.

Year after year, we have had the same old arguments. Now, we rarely even talk about our problems. It's almost as if we have settled for a cold war. No passion. No excitement. Certainly no intimacy.</i></p> <p><i>I always knew marriage wouldn't be perfect, but I expected it to be more fulfilling than this. John just doesn't seem to care anymore. He gets more excited about the latest football scores than he does about our relationship. He's more upset about losing a golf game than hurting my feelings. Even when he does something nice, I can tell he does it out of duty, not love. This isn't what marriage is supposed to be. I'm not sure I ever would have married had I known this is what I would get.</i></p> <p><i>Sometimes I am so angry with John. We seem just a couple steps away from happiness, but we never get there. Why can't he realize how insensitive he is to my needs? Why can't he value the marriage as much as I do? Sometimes I don't even feel like it's worth trying any more. Did I make a mistake when I married him? Is there any hope for us?</i></p> <p><i>�Kara</i></p></blockquote> <p></p> <p>In my counseling practice, I hear far too many wives whose feelings would be expressed by this session with Kara. Hoping to find true love, they have found true frustration. Looking for happily ever after, they have endured enough disappointment to last a lifetime. Shattered dreams and unmet needs�what woman can't relate to them? With all that can be said of and for marriage, it rarely lives up to the dreams of many hopeful brides.</p> <p>Emily had dreamed of marriage since she was a little girl. Her parent's marriage had lasted a mere four years after Emily was born. Even as a young child, she remembered the arguments and the yelling. She could only imagine what it would be like to have a mom and dad who loved each other. Emily's hope for a loving family were soon invested in her dreams for intimacy and marriage. She wondered what kind of man she would marry and vowed that they would never be divorced.</p> <p>After Emily grew up, her dreams were no less vivid. The drawers of her desk at work were stuffed with bride's magazines and romance novels�symbols of her longing for the perfect marriage. She hoped that everything bad about her life would disappear in the face of a wonderful marriage. The loneliness and pain would melt away when she was enveloped in the unconditional love of her "hero."</p> <p>When Emily was twenty-five, her fantasy finally began to materialize. She met someone who appeared to be the man of her dreams. After a whirlwind courtship, the two were engaged with every hope of a match made in heaven. He seemed to complement her in every way, as his strengths compensated for her weaknesses. For awhile, her loneliness disappeared. Her fiancT seemed perfect, attentive to her thoughts and dreams.</p> <p>The long-awaited day finally arrived. Walking down the aisle, Emily looked more beautiful than even she had imagined. Her prince was breathtaking in his tuxedo, his eyes filled with hope. In the secret recesses of her heart, she hoped that maybe she had discovered the impossible�true love. Their family and friends waved good-bye as the newlyweds fled to a romantic honeymoon getaway.</p> <p>As the days and weeks of their new marriage wore on, the conflicts began to emerge. Emily's new husband was not nearly as attentive to her as he had been before they married. He spent hours in the garage, rebuilding an old car. Sometimes on Friday nights he went out with the guys after work and came home after midnight. Emily felt the first shock of disappointment as the luster on her prince's armor began to tarnish. How could she be married, yet still have the same feelings of loneliness she had fought all of these years? Not wanting to make her husband angry, she swallowed her hurt and did every thing she knew to do to keep peace in the marriage.</p> <p>By the time a year had passed, their marriage had become little more than a casual friendship. As Emily lay in bed one night, quietly sobbing into her pillow, she asked herself, "Did I marry the right person?" Every quality of her prince that had once reassured her now seemed to be collapsing into a heap of weaknesses. Panic seized her as she realized that her marriage was becoming just like that of her parents. Her fairy tale had evaporated.</p> <p>This example highlights the contrast between the romantic expectations of too many women and the reality of marriage. A nanve young woman like Emily, determined not to make the same mistakes her parents had made but not knowing how to avoid them, would seem destined for disappointment. Her expectations for her husband were unrealistic. She did not anticipate conflict, anger and trials to be a part of her marriage. She was naturally crushed when the feelings of love began to waver.</p> <p>But what about the older and more mature? Are they immune from unrealistic expectations and therefore more likely to be satisfied in marriage? Although they may be less surprised at the difficulty of marriage, older women are just as likely to be frustrated that their marriages are not more intimate.</p> <p>Becky and Gene were in their mid-thirties when they got married. Because they wed later in life, they had fairly realistic expectations of what marriage would be. They had dated for over two years and had a good handle on their respective strengths and limitations. They knew that their big disagreements would always be over the issues of in-laws and money. Becky and Gene were prepared for marriage. They had every reason to be optimistic about their union and trusted God to bless their new family.</p> <p>Becky came to me for counseling two years into the marriage. After only a few minutes she collapsed into tears. "I am beginning to realize that Gene is never going to change. He will always be obsessed with work and he will never understand that I need more from him! I can't imagine living our whole lives together feeling this lonely. The worst part is that he doesn't even notice anything is wrong!"</p> <p>Even if, like Becky, a woman thinks she is prepared for marriage, there will almost certainly come a point where she feels cheated. Something inside of her screams, "I deserve better than this!" Every thoughtless comment, forgotten birthday or sarcastic attitude reminds her of how broken her dream of fulfilling love seems to be. She wonders, "Is it my fault? Am I trying too hard or not hard enough? Why isn't this working the way it's supposed to?"</p> <p>Marriage has been described as "a romance in which the hero dies in the first chapter." Many women, like Emily and Becky, are deeply wounded to learn that their dream of "the prince" exists only in fantasy. They may look enviously at other marriages and idolize husbands who are not their own, concluding that they simply picked the wrong man. They flock to seminars and workshops that promise three-step solutions to happiness, thinking, "if only I kiss my frog, he will turn into a prince." Like Cinderella in her dirty work clothes, they hope, "Somewhere is a fairy godmother who can make me beautiful enough to be cherished." The fantasy lives on�and so does the letdown.</p> <p>Overcoming the disappointment of marriage is a tremendous obstacle to building true intimacy. Often our understanding of love and marriage is unrealistic and incorrect. When we confront the real-life work of marriage, including disagreements, arguments and failures, we feel as if we have missed out on what we were promised.</p> <p>Modern culture both influences our thinking and reflects our misconceptions about marriage. Think about much of the entertainment marketed for women, both young and old. Movies, television programs, cartoons and romance novels consistently tell a story of a woman searching for love. Finally, she finds "Mr. Right." The stories almost always end when the man and women proclaim their love, with a wedding or at least a kiss to solidify their commitment. The message is clear: find the prince and you will become a princess. His love will rescue you. You will live happily ever after. No wonder girls and women alike often have an inaccurate view of both marriage and lasting love.</p> <p>We recently took our two children to the magical land of Walt Disney World. At Cinderella's castle, we ate breakfast with many of the Disney characters. Cinderella and her handsome Prince Charming fluttered through the room. When they got to our table, I playfully asked them about the state of their marriage. Prince Charming looked lovingly into his bride's eyes, held her hands, and said, "We have been married for 50 years and are still madly in love." I asked, "What is your secret?" "Living in Walt Disney World!" the Prince replied. Of course! Cinderella and Prince Charming are frozen in time. They have not aged or faced the realities of life. For fifty years they have lived on their wedding day. In fact, they still wear the same clothes.</p> <p>On the surface, their marriage seems perfect. The problem is that there is nothing more than the surface. Imagine that it were possible to live every day in the ecstasy of intoxicating new love. Fifty years of it. Never a fight or disagreement because there is never an issue to discuss. What a shallow existence! There has to be more to love than Cinderella's castle every day for fifty years.</p> <p>Of course there is more to love. But it is never realized through escaping the reality of disappointment and conflict.</p> <p>Newspaperman and novelist Edgar Watson Howe once said, "Marriage is a good deal like a circus: There is not as much in it as is represented in the advertising." Over time, most wives learn to live with their broken dreams and unfulfilled expectations. They accept that princes and princesses are fairy tales for children. "Adults live in the real world, with real relationships," they tell themselves. "Intimacy is simply unrealistic." Those who refuse to acce...</p></p><h2>Defending the King James Bible</h2><p>This book is now a classic. It has been printed ten times through two editions. It should be in every library, school, seminary, and home. Dr. Waite&#39;s work answer&#39;s two questions: (1) Which English Bible are we to read, study, memorize, preach from, and use today? (2) Which English Bible can we hold in our hands and say with great confidence, &#34;These are the WORDS OF GOD in English&#34;? He examine&#39;s the KING JAMES BIBLE, proving its superiority in four areas: (1) its superior TEXTS; (2) its superior TRANSLATORS; (3) its superior TECHNIQUES; and (4) its superior THEOLOGY.</p><p>The author of this book, Dr. D. A. Waite, received a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) in classical Greek and Latin from the University of Michigan in 1948, a Th.M. (Master of Theology), with high honors, in New Testament Greek Literature and Exegesis from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1952, an M.A. (Master of Arts) in Speech from Southern Methodist University in 1953, a Th.D. (Doctor of Theology), with honors, in Bible Exposition from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1955, and a Ph.D. in Speech from Purdue University in 1961. He holds both New Jersey and Pennsylvania teacher certificates in Greek and Language Arts. <p>He has been a teacher in the areas of Greek, Hebrew, Bible, Speech, and English for over thirty-five years in nine schools, including one junior high, one senior high, three Bible institutes, two colleges, two universities, and one seminary. He served his country as a Navy Chaplain for five years on active duty; pastored two churches; was Chairman and Director of the Radio and Audio-Film Commission of the American Council of Christian Churches; since 1971, has been Founder, President, and Director of The Bible For Today; since 1978, has been President of the Dean Burgon Society; has produced over 700 other studies, booklets, cassettes, or VCR's on various topics; and is heard on both a five-minute daily and thirty-minute weekly radio program in defense of traditional Bible texts, presently on 25 stations. Dr. and Mrs. Waite have been married since 1948; they have four sons, one daughter, and (at present) eight grandchildren.</p>from Questions and Answers: Q. What would you suggest as a help to use with the King James Bible--one source or two you would use in everyday study? A. Strong's Concordance is good. It is keyed to Greek and Hebrew words, and in the back you have the Greek and Hebrew words given in alphabetical order, including the meaning of each word. You would also be helped by a good Bible dictionary. You don't really need much in addition to this in the beginning of your Bible study. <p>Q. Isn't it difficult to get the real meaning in the English language? A. The English language is a wide and expansive language with technical terms and detailed words from Latin, Greek and all languages. We have a way of saying it in English that many languages do not have. We have a vast number of adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc. that they don't even have in other languages. I would think the English language would be a good one to be able to say exactly what you mean and precisely what is in the Hebrew and Greek. </p><p>Q. Is it difficult to make the Hebrew exact into English? A. No, it is easy. But these men who translated the New American Standard Version and especially the New International Version (probably the greatest transgressor--except for the living version which is far-out) have purposely avoided bringing it over exactly. They don't want that. It's not a question that it is difficult and therefore they cannot succeed. They succeed in the goal they have set for themselves. </p><p>Let me show you in the New International Version of 1969, a word on what their goal was (page viii of the Preface): "The first concern of the translators has been the accuracy of the translation and its fidelity to the thought of the Biblical writers." Now, what's wrong with that? Is that what we're interested in, only the thought? You see, we're interested in the words. We believe in plenary, VERBAL inspiration of Scripture. "Plenary" is "full," (that is, from Genesis to Revelation). "Verbal" means the very words are "God-breathed." If you're only interested in fidelity to the thought, then you don't care about the words. You can throw this one away, or that one away. And they do. It just grieves me when I look at the NIV. </p><p>I listened every morning at 5:45 a.m. to the KING JAMES BIBLE on the cassettes while reading in the NIV to compare the two. How they rend it, twist it, add to it, and move it around! I have finished it finally. I found over 6,653 examples of dynamic equivalency without even half trying. There are many, many more. The NIV editors could have translated the Bible literally, with verbal and formal equivalence, but they wanted to stay with the thought, not the words. To continue reading from the NIV Preface: </p><p>"They have weighed the significance of the lexical and grammatical details of the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. At the same time they have striven for more than a word-for-word translation." [They don't want word-for-word translation] "Because thought patterns and syntax differ from language to language, faithful communication of the meaning of the writers of the Bible demands frequent modification in sentence structure and constant regard for the contextual meanings of words." [New International Version, 1978 edition, p. viii.] </p><p>So they have to change the sentence structure, and they do. If it's a question, they often turn it into a statement. If it's a statement, they turn it into a question. Many of the things are backwards. So when you read this, you can see the purpose of it is not to make it exact. They think that is a wrong way to make it. It's not a question of being too difficult. </p><p>Let me start from the Hebrew copy. It says bera-shith. b is "in" and rashith is "the head, or beginning." So, Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." The King James translators wrote, "In the beginning . . . " That is a good start, simple, clear, easy. The next word, bara "created" elohim "God" (the Hebrew has the words in different order) eth (the sign of the accusative, or direct object) ha shamaim "the heavens" wa eth "and" plus the accusative sign again ha erets "the earth." This is exactly the way it is. You don't have to change it around. </p><p>You will find that the NIV and the others have probably kept this verse just as it is. I'll tell you something about the NIV as well as some of the others. The favorite and the familiar verses they keep pretty well intact in order to sell their Bibles. You turn to Psalm 23 in any of these Bibles they will be very much like the King James translation because they don't want to take you too far away from what you're used to. They know people look at John 3:16, Psalm 23, Genesis 1:1. The New American Standard has the same rendering of Genesis 1:1. But that doesn't mean that is the way they handle things throughout their translations. They purposely do it.</p></p><h2>Lift</h2><p><em>No matter when and why this comes to your hands, I want to put down on paper how things started with us.</em><br><br> Written as a letter to her children, Kelly Corrigan's <em>Lift</em> is a tender, intimate, and robust portrait of risk and love; a touchstone for anyone who wants to live more fully. In <em>Lift</em>, Corrigan weaves together three true and unforgettable stories of adults willing to experience emotional hazards in exchange for the gratifications of raising children.<br><br> <em>Lift</em> takes its name from hang gliding, a pursuit that requires flying directly into rough air, because turbulence saves a glider from "sinking out." For Corrigan, this wisdom--that to fly requires chaotic, sometimes even violent passages--becomes a metaphor for all of life's most meaningful endeavors, particularly the great flight that is parenting.<br><br> Corrigan serves it up straight--how mundanely and fiercely her children have been loved, how close most lives occasionally come to disaster, and how often we fall short as mothers and fathers. <em>Lift</em> is for everyone who has been caught off guard by the pace and vulnerability of raising children, to remind us that our work is important and our time limited.<br><br> Like Anne Morrow Lindbergh's <em>Gift from the Sea, Lift</em> is a meditation on the complexities of a woman's life, and like Corrigan's memoir, <em>The Middle Place, Lift</em> is boisterous and generous, a book readers can't wait to share.</p><p><strong>Kelly Corrigan</strong> is, more than anything else, the mother of two young girls. While they're at school, Kelly writes a newspaper column, the occasional magazine article, and possible chapters of a novel. She is also the creator of CircusOfCancer.org, a website that teaches people how to help a friend through breast cancer. Kelly lives outside San Francisco with her husband, Edward Lichty, and their children."Although we've never met, I love Kelly Corrigan like a friend. Her work gives me a rich sense of intimacy with someone who is full of life and hard-fought wisdom.

He studied at Leipzig, where he showed interest in the occult, and at Strassburg, where Herder introduced him to Shakespeare&#x2019;s works and to folk poetry. He produced some essays and lyrical verse, and at twenty-two wrote&nbsp;<b>G�tz von Berlichingen</b>, a play which brought him national fame and established him in the current Sturm und Drang movement. This was followed by the novel&nbsp;<b>The Sorrows of Young Werther</b>&nbsp;in 1774, which was an even greater success.Goethe began work on&nbsp;<b>Faust</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Egmont</b>, another tragedy before being invited to join the government of Weimar. His interest in the classical world led him to leave suddenly for Italy in 1786 and the Italian Journey recounts his travels there.&nbsp;<b>Iphigenia in Tauris</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Torquato Tasso</b>, classical dramas, were written at this time. Returning to Weimar, Goethe started the second part of&nbsp;<b>Faust</b>, encouraged by Schiller. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. During this late period he finished his series of Wilhelm Master books and wrote many other works, including&nbsp;<b>The Oriental Divan</b>&nbsp;(1819). He also directed the State Theatre and worked on scientific theories in evolutionary botany, anatomy and color. Goethe completed&nbsp;<b>Faust</b>&nbsp;in 1832, just before he died.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Haunted (A Michael Bennett Thriller, 10)</h2><p><b>Detective Michael Bennett and his family are ready to escape New York for a vacation in Maine-but a shocking scene deep in the woods reveals a dark world of drugs and murder.</b><b><br></b>Haunted by guilt and shame, Michael Bennett is living with a father's worst nightmare.

Gladly. And with much exuberance. But, alas, my ex-BFF Jessica was indeed dead, and ranting on and on about how her death was entirely my fault. Which was so not true. It was only partly my fault. I wasn&#x2019;t the one who&#x2019;d kicked her off a seven-story grain elevator. Though I was beginning to wish I had. At least then I would&#x2019;ve had a reason to listen to her harp ad nauseam. Life was too short for this crap.</p> <p>After rolling my eyes so far back into my head I almost dislodged them from their sockets, I glanced over at my driver and the owner of said SUV, Agent Carson. Actually, it was FBI Special Agent Carson, but that was way too many syllables, in my book. I&#x2019;d tried to get her to change her name to SAC&#x2014;or even FBISAC, since we could&#x2019;ve called her Phoebe for short&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d have none of it. Her loss. No telling how much time she could save if she didn&#x2019;t have all those syllables to deal with.</p> <p>Fortunately for SAC, she couldn&#x2019;t hear Jessica, but the other supernatural entity in the car&#x2014;one Mr. Reyes Alexander Farrow, the hot hunk of corporeal manliness sitting in the middle seat of the long SUV&#x2014;most definitely could. It was his own fault, however. He was the one who&#x2019;d insisted on playing bodyguard ever since we found out a group of hellhounds had escaped from molten gates down under and were on their way to this plane to dismember me.</p> <p>As a diversionary tactic&#x2014;since I had the innate ability to visualize my own dismemberment to an alarming degree&#x2014;I was working on some of the cold cases SAC had asked me to look into, to see if anything caught my eye. And the folder containing an unsolved ten-year-old multiple murder definitely caught my eye.</p> <p>Well, okay, they all caught my eye, but this one seemed to pull at me. To lure me. It begged to be solved. Five people&#x2014;two adults and three teens&#x2014;had been killed one night while preparing to open a summer camp for special-needs kids. They were each stabbed multiple times and found in a sea of blood by another camp supervisor the next morning. Another young girl, the only daughter of the two adults, was never found.</p> <p>The only real suspect they&#x2019;d had was a homeless man who scavenged the campsites in the area, stealing food from campers when they went on hikes or slept. But the forensics unit found no evidence linking him to the crime scene. Not a fingerprint. Not a drop of blood. Not a single strand of the suspect&#x2019;s hair.</p> <p>And so the case went unsolved. Until now. The FBI had finally wised up and put Charley Davidson on the task of bringing a killer to justice. Because that&#x2019;s what Charley did. Brought killers to justice. She also found lost dogs, exposed cheating spouses, and tracked down the occasional skip. And she rarely referred to herself in the third person.</p> <p>I had a few other specialties as well. Mostly because I&#x2019;d been born the grim reaper. I could see dead people, for one, a fact that helped me solve many a case. Odd how easy it was to solve cases when one could ask the victim whodunit. Not that I could always rely on that natural advantage. Some people didn&#x2019;t know who&#x2019;d killed them. That was rare, but it happened. A traumatized brain was a complicated brain. Still, I got good intel most of the time.</p> <p>In this case, however, the chances of finding the departed just hanging out at the crime scene where they&#x2019;d died ten years earlier were slim. It was worth a shot either way, which was why I&#x2019;d agreed to let SAC pick me up at the ungodly hour of 6 A.M. to show me the crime scene firsthand. Along with me, however, came a bit of baggage, and it was sitting in the two backseats. Jessica, my ex-BFF, blamed me for her death. Ad nauseam. Reyes, my affianced, blamed me for his sour mood. I chose to ignore them both.</p> <p>&#x201c;The view is gorgeous,&#x201d; I said as we wound up the Jemez Mountains. The sun was barely clearing the treetops, casting an orange glow over us. The pine and juniper glistened with the early morning dew, their shadows sliding across the window as we drove deeper into the pass. We didn&#x2019;t see a lot of green in Albuquerque, so the fact that all this lay just an hour away boggled my mind. I loved the Jemez.</p> <p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; SAC agreed.</p> <p>&#x201c;My dad used to bring us up here on his motorcycle. But isn&#x2019;t all this reservation land?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;How did the FBI get jurisdiction?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tribal law is complicated,&#x201d; she said, her brown bob swaying as she glanced in her rearview for the hundredth time that morning. But she wasn&#x2019;t checking for traffic. She was checking on the surly man behind her. &#x201c;In a case like this, we actually would&#x2019;ve had jurisdiction, because the campsite isn&#x2019;t on Pueblo land. Either way, it only makes sense to bring in outside authorities. One of the teens was Native American, which is a whole other issue, but the tribal council was more than happy to have us do the investigation.&#x201d;</p> <p>She tightened her grip on the steering wheel, her gaze darting again to the rearview. I couldn&#x2019;t blame her. Reyes was certainly something to look at. Since I could feel emotions radiate off people like others could feel the weather, I felt every infusion of warmth that rushed through her with his nearness. He affected her like hot tea on a winter&#x2019;s day, but she hid it well. I had to give her kudos for that. She was curious about him but guarded. Since Reyes, dark and dangerous, was an enigma even to me, SAC was smart to be guarded. But there was no denying the raw magnetism, the sensuous allure he unconsciously sent out in sweet, pulsating waves.</p> <p>Either that or I was ovulating.</p> <p>No, wait. No chance of that. It was him. A side effect of being created by the most beautiful angel ever to fall from the heavens, forged in the fires of sin and degradation. All the stuff one&#x2019;s mother warns one about.</p> <p>I struggled to keep from taking a peek every few seconds myself. But just for good measure, I decided to risk a quick look-see. I took out my phone, flipped the camera for a selfie, and focused it on the man riding in the middle seat. He leaned into one corner, sitting spread-eagle across the seat, one arm thrown over the back of it, watching me from underneath his lashes. Studying me.</p> <p>I raised my chin a notch, refusing to be affected by his shadowy, brooding gaze. I was just as mad at him as he was at me. For two weeks now, he&#x2019;d insisted on escorting me everywhere, forgoing his responsibilities at that bar and grill he owned to be my babysitter.</p> <p>Of course, I was now carrying his baby, and she was kind of a big deal. Destined to save the world and all. So I couldn&#x2019;t be too angry. And he was damned nice to look at, even when he scowled. In fact, if I were totally honest, that scowl only added to the allure that was Reyes Farrow. Damn it. When I scowled, I looked constipated. Leave it to the son of Satan to turn a scowl into the stuff of fantasies.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t like he had a reason to be mad at me, though. Not <i>that</i> mad, anyway. I&#x2019;d tried to sneak out of the apartment without him, to go on this case with Agent Carson alone and get some one-on-one girl time. I soon found out that was the wrong thing to do. He told me so repeatedly before she&#x2019;d arrived outside my apartment building entrance, reminding me that the Twelve, aka the aforementioned hellhounds, were hot on my heels. But even if they made it through the void of oblivion that resided between hell and this plane, and even if they did manage to escape into this dimension, they would still have to find me. And demons, even hellhounds, had their limitations on this plane.</p> <p>So, after a ten-minute lecture that involved Reyes reiterating&#x2014;repeatedly&#x2014;and me tapping my foot in impatience, Agent Carson pulled up in her SUV. We&#x2019;d thrown her when we both climbed into her official vehicle, but I quickly explained that Reyes, my affianced, had separation anxiety.</p> <p>She took it well. She was supercool like that. Most of the time. There was one exception, when she&#x2019;d threatened to have me arrested and promised I&#x2019;d spend the rest of my life in prison if I didn&#x2019;t <i>cooperate fully</i>. Like I wouldn&#x2019;t have cooperated without her threats. Besides that one tiny incident&#x2014;and maybe two more where I&#x2019;d thought she was going to either shoot me in the face or drop-kick me to China&#x2014;she was full of marshmallowy goodness. And Reyes seemed to be the campfire that melted her creamy center. She was warm. Really warm. And her warmth was making me warm. Like a lot. I couldn&#x2019;t be 100 percent, but I was pretty sure we were in the midst of a m�nage.</p> <p>&#x201c;As if&#x201d;&#x2014;Jessica the departed banshee said from the backseat&#x2014;&#x201c;that weren&#x2019;t bad enough, I will never get married. Never! Do you know what that feels like?&#x201d; Her long red hair shook almost as bad as my hands. Caffeine withdrawal sucked, as evidenced by the quivering of my limbs. But she was vibrating with anger. A vindictive, spiteful kind of rage that turned her hazel irises to a bright shade of green.</p> <p>Jessica and I had been besties in high school until I made the mistake of telling her not only what I could do&#x2014;see dead people&#x2014;but also what I was&#x2014;the grim reaper. I&#x2019;d learned that last bit myself only when a robed figure, an incorporeal being I used to call the Big Bad, approached me in the girls&#x2019; restroom and told me. That robed figure turned out to be Reyes, I found out a decade later. I had yet to confront him on that. What was he doing in the girls&#x2019; restroom in the first place? The perv.</p> <p>Jessica didn&#x2019;t handle my admission well. I&#x2019;d thought her made of kindness and strength before the day she turned on me. Fear transformed her into something I didn&#x2019;t recognize. Her vehemence, her wrath and betrayal, stole my breath. I cried for days&#x2014;not in front of her, of course; never in front of her&#x2014;and sank into a deep depression that took me months to recover from.</p> <p>When she started showing up at Reyes&#x2019;s bar and grill, I hadn&#x2019;t seen her since high school. Lots of women started showing up at the bar and grill when Reyes bought it from my dad. Sadly, Jessica hadn&#x2019;t changed. She still hated me and took every opportunity to be spiteful and manipulative in front of her friends. When a notorious crime lord mistook her for a close friend of mine and abducted her, holding her hostage to force me to do a job for him, events had not ended well. And I thought she&#x2019;d hated me before!</p> <p>So, in a vehicle with four people, three of us were angry. I felt like breaking into a chorus of &#x201c;One of These Things (Is Not Like the Other),&#x201d; but I doubted anyone but me would get it, especially since Agent Carson didn&#x2019;t know the truth about me. And she had no idea there was a departed crazy woman hitching a ride with us before her inevitable trip to hell. Surely she was going to hell. Jessica had not been a nice person. There must be a special, less volcanic portion of hell that was partitioned off and set aside for people who weren&#x2019;t all bad, just a little vindictive. They could call it the drama queen ward. It would be a huge hit.</p> <p>Listening to Jessica&#x2019;s rant about how she was going to be a spinster forever&#x2014;did people still use that word?&#x2014;I decided to text my sulking affianced:</p> <p>Can you do something about this?</p> <p>He dug his phone out of his pocket, an act that was so bizarrely sexy, it mesmerized me for a solid three seconds, then read my missive. His face remained impassive as he typed.</p> <p>A second later, my phone chimed.</p> <p>Why would I do that? It&#x2019;s getting you hot.</p> <p>What? I turned and stabbed him with an appalled expression, then typed back, my fingers flying over the keyboard:</p> <p>Wrong kind of hot, mister. This kind of hot leaves bodies in its wake. It takes no prisoners. It&#x2019;s very&nbsp;&#x2026; testy.</p> <p>&#x201c;The minute you try to get married,&#x201d; Jessica continued, her rant a never-ending drone of threats and complaints, kind of like I imagined the life of an IRS agent might be, &#x201c;I will rip your dress to shreds the night before your wedding day and, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Reyes was apparently getting hot as well. He offered me a quick wink, his ridiculously long lashes making his mocha eyes sparkle in the early morning sun, then tossed a deadly glare over his shoulder. Jessica&#x2019;s eyes widened at his unprecedented attention, and the yapping stopped immediately. Deciding to pout in silence, she let her fiery red hair fall over her shoulders as she crossed her arms at her chest and stared out the window.</p> <p>With a satisfied smile, I typed,</p> <p>I owe you.</p> <p>I know.</p> <p>Do you take payments?</p> <p>I have several installment plans. We can hammer out the details when we get home.</p> <p>My insides jumped in delight. Gawd, it was hard to stay mad at him.</p> <p>Deal.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, where are you from?&#x201d; Agent Carson asked Reyes. &#x201c;Originally?&#x201d;</p> <p>I whirled around to face him again, this time pinning him with a warning glare. Carson was an FBI agent, but I was all about stealth. Surely she wouldn&#x2019;t pick up on my silent threat.</p> <p>He studied my mouth, not the least bit worried about my warning glare, then said at last, &#x201c;Here and there.&#x201d;</p> <p>I relaxed against the seatback. He didn&#x2019;t say <i>hell</i>. Thank God he didn&#x2019;t say hell. It was always hard to explain to friends how, exactly, one&#x2019;s fianc� was born and raised in the eternal flames of damnation. How his father was, in fact, public enemy number one. And how he&#x2019;d escaped from hell and was born on earth as a human to be with his true love. As romantic as it all sounded, it was difficult to articulate without garnering a visit from men with butterfly nets.</p> <p>&#x201c;You been in Albuquerque long?&#x201d; she asked him.</p> <p>Now she was fishing. She knew who he was. Everyone knew who he was. He&#x2019;d been something of a local celebrity when the state released him from prison for killing the man who&#x2019;d raised him&#x2014;<i>raised</i> being an insanely generous term. They&#x2019;d really had no choice when said man showed up alive and well-ish. Reyes did have to sever his spine, but he was still living and breathing. Through a tube! That was the best part. Still, all the news reports about Reyes&#x2019;s wrongful conviction were making him pretty popular. Not quite so popular as Heisenberg and Pinkman, but one could hope.</p> <p>&#x201c;As long as I can remember,&#x201d; he said in answer to her question.</p> <p>&#x201c;He bought Dad&#x2019;s bar and grill,&#x201d; I told her, changing the subject.</p> <p>&#x201c;I heard that,&#x201d; she said. She&#x2019;d done her homework. She probably knew his shoe size and how he took his coffee.</p> <p><i>Coffee.</i></p> <p>I started drooling at the thought. It had been several hours since I last had a cup. I&#x2019;d read a couple of days ago that caffeine was bad for little budding babies and had to psych myself up to quit. I was not going to make it. No way. Nohow. It just would not happen.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re adjusting?&#x201d; she asked Reyes, referring to his life on the outside.</p> <p>&#x201c;How about AC?&#x201d; I asked her, changing the subject again. I&#x2019;d felt Reyes tense with her prying questions, but she was honestly just curious. Surely he felt that as clearly as I did. Then again, we hadn&#x2019;t had the greatest morning.

Each woman's experience helps us see a truer, fuller, richer version of what really happened in this country during this time period.</p><p>Marianne Monson is a writer and professor of English with a strong interest in the relationship between literature and history. She teaches Creative Writing at Portland Community College and regularly speaks at writing conferences.''Monson is an excellent storyteller whose research fills in the gaps regarding women and the Civil War in <i>Women of the Blue and Gray</i>, centering on those who rebelled against expectations. The book covers those who flouted norms to participate in the war...Monson captures these women in vivid historical scenes. The women themselves speak though quotes from their writings, speeches and letters. They are portrayed in terrifically difficult situations, bringing depth and life to the historical record. While women of both the North and the South are represented, the book takes a clear and worthwhile stance by placing the stories of women of color front and center whenever possible. For adults and teens who want to know more about the American Civil War and women's important and varied roles in it, <i>Women of the Blue and Gray</i> is a powerful book that paints a picture that is at turns inspiring and upsetting.'' --<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br><br>''Solid follow-up to Frontier Grit....the biographies zing with personality and page-turning prose....The thematic chapters cover a variety of topics, including cross-dressing women who served as soldiers, medical care, the experiences of enslaved people, and the Native American women whose home regions became war zones and whose male relatives enlisted on both sides. Entertaining and accessible book is a suitable introduction for readers beginning their foray into Civil War history.'' --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>''Finally! The women of the Civil War period receive some strong attention in this excellent collection of biographical sketches. Monson hails from a literary background, and her approach to this enormously overlooked history possesses a dramatic narrative appeal that reflects her novelist expertise. By covering a wide range of the female experience, from soldiers and spies to nurses, diarists, activists, and even a military strategist, Monson succeeds impressively in her mission to consider as many wartime female perspectives as possible. The diversity of her subjects is also outstanding, with profiles of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Native American women. The background provided for each biographical category is also illuminating, and readers will delight in the utter absence of dull language. History-loving book clubs will find much to discuss here, and students of all ages (especially of women's history) will find it an excellent resource. Don't dismiss this as a routine resource: <i>Women of the Blue and Gray</i> is full of surprises.'' --<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>The St. Martin&#39;s Sourcebook for Writing Tutors</h2><p>A brief guide to tutoring, with an anthology of essays.

Tonight he sat at a table at the Kitty Cat Club on Sunset Boulevard, watching a little blonde pole dancer with the hottest body he'd ever seen and trying like hell not to get an erection.<br><br>He reached for the Bud Light sitting in front of him, took a swallow and set the barely touched bottle back down on the table. He wasn't there to get drunk. He wasn't there to get turned on by some sexy little piece of fluff.<br><br>He was there to make a collar and a nice chunk of change.<br><br>A former Army Ranger with a P.I.'s license, Johnnie spent most of his time in the bars and clubs of Los Angeles, digging up information for clients who could afford his fees. And the occasional recovery job, if the money was high enough.<br><br>He glanced around the club, one of the better run strip joints in the area, a place an out-of-town businessman could go for a little harmless fun and not feel like he was about to get mugged when he walked outside to catch a cab.<br><br>Johnnie knew the owner, a guy named Tate Watters, a reasonable sort who ran a clean operation. Tate knew Johnnie was there to collect a skip, but Tate was a stand-up guy who did his best to stay on the right side of the law, and having a pervert around&#x2014;Johnnie's target&#x2014;wasn't good for business.<br><br>It was dark inside the club except for the neon beer signs behind the bar and the soft glow of lights over gilt-framed photos of nineteen-fifties strippers that hung on the walls. A row of colored spotlights lit the woman performing onstage.<br><br>The place smelled like stale beer and cheap perfume, and rock music hid the sound of clinking bar glasses and the heavy breathing of the men. Customers sat in the darkness at small round tables sipping whiskey or beer, staring toward the entertainment with big smiles on their faces.<br><br>Johnnie didn't blame them. He'd be wearing a big smile, too, along with a raging hard-on if he wasn't there on business.<br><br>He watched the woman on the stage. She was twenty-five or -six, a pretty little exotic dancer wearing nothing but red sequined pasties and a matching G-string. She wasn't just petite, she was dainty, little more than five feet tall, with the shiniest, straightest, long blond hair he'd ever seen. Short bangs fluttered across her forehead above a pair of blue eyes that made him shift in his seat against his growing arousal, and muttering a curse between his teeth.<br><br>The music played, the beat steady, loud and erotic. She raised a red spike heel, wrapped her calf around the pole and slid up, then sank back down, rubbing the pole between her pale, perfectly proportioned legs. He felt a tug in his gut so strong he had to shove back his chair and get up from the table. Grabbing his beer bottle, he walked to the back of the club where he could survey the room and put a little more distance between him and the scrumptious piece of ass on the stage.<br><br>He scanned the patrons, keeping a careful watch for his target.<br><br>Earlier in the week, he'd gotten a call from his Ranger buddy in Houston. Trace Rawlins owned a security firm with branches in Houston and Dallas. In the years since they'd left the army, they had worked together a dozen times, most recently on an abduction case that had led them into Mexico.<br><br>According to Trace, a guy named Ray Carroll had jumped bail and was on the run. Rumor was he had friends in L.A. and odds were good that was where he had gone to ground. Good ol' Ray had been arrested for possession and trafficking in child pornography&#x2014;the lowest of the low as far as Johnnie was concerned. He would have taken the guy down for free if he'd had to, which fortunately he didn't.<br><br>The case was interesting because Ray was the grandson of the late Texas oil billionaire, C. P. Carroll. C.P.'s widow was filthy rich and she doted on her grandson, which, with that kind of money at his disposal, made Ray a flight risk. His bail had been set at a half-million dollars, which his grandmother had posted.<br><br>But Ray had taken off for parts unknown, leaving grandma on the hook for a boatload of money if her boy wasn't caught and brought back to appear in court. For ten percent of the bail fee, a cool fifty thou less a referral fee to Trace, Johnnie had agreed to find him. Surprisingly, once he'd started digging, narrowing his search hadn't been all that hard.<br><br>Since leopards didn't change their spots and jackals like Ray were fairly predictable, it didn't take long to find out that Carroll hung out in the local strip clubs.<br><br>The Kitty Cat was his favorite. According to the bartender who ID'd the photo Johnnie had shown him, a guy calling himself Ray Conners had been in the club both Wednesday and Thursday nights. Johnnie had come in on Friday and again tonight but so far hadn't seen any sign of him. Not until now.<br><br>The black padded vinyl front door swung open, letting a thin slice of street noise into the club. Recalling the photo, Johnnie recognized Ray Carroll as he ambled over to the bar. He was an average-looking forty-year-old, with thinning brown hair and the kind of greasy smile you'd expect to see on a creep like him. He sat down on one of the black vinyl bar stools, and the bartender, a tall, spare, good-looking Hispanic guy named Dante, flashed Johnnie a heads-up glance before taking Ray's drink order, a double Grey Goose martini on the rocks.<br><br>A cocktail waitress walked past. The girls who performed also served drinks, though for that they wore a few more clothes. This one, a brunette, was tall and svelte, dressed in a little blue satin two-piece number, the bottom cut high on the sides, a built-in push-up bra shoving her heavy cleavage nearly over the top. Not indecent, but definitely less than the old bunny outfits they wore at the Playboy Club.<br><br>Johnnie sipped his beer, his attention fixed on Ray, who stared with fascination toward the stage. The dancer, Angel Fontaine, being not much bigger than a kid, was Ray's favorite according to Dante. He watched as she dipped and swayed to the music, the red sequins on her nipples flashing in the spotlight, the light changing color to the rhythm of the music.<br><br>Johnnie tried to look away, but found himself as mesmerized as the drunks at the tables. Like the rest of her body, her breasts were perfectly formed, not too large, not too small and tilted provocatively upward.<br><br>Her face wasn't perfect, he had finally gotten around to noticing. Her mouth was a little too wide, making her pouty lips a little too pronounced. Her cheeks were as flawless as rose petals but her chin was a little too pointy.<br><br>She was the sexiest woman Johnnie had ever seen.<br><br>She turned, thrust her pale, luscious ass into the air and wiggled it suggestively, and his groin tightened. If he didn't make his move soon, he wouldn't be able to walk, let alone make a collar.<br><br>Ray came off his stool just then and started toward the stage. Johnnie noticed the folded dollar bills in one hand as he approached the little blonde.<br><br>Another man beat Ray to her, leaning over and stuffing a ten-dollar bill into Angel's sequined G-string, the scrap of red barely covering the spot every guy in the place dreamed of touching. Angel whirled away from him and smiled, mouthing a thank-you. When she turned her back, raised her arms above her head and began swaying to the hard rock beat, another man stuffed a bill into the glittering strip of red around her waist above that sweet little ass.<br><br>Ray moved closer, hovering as Angel approached the edge of the stage. He leaned toward her, stuffed the money into her G-string. He was grinning when he turned away, his mind on pussy instead of escape.<br><br>Johnnie made his move, slamming into Carroll, knocking him over an empty table, both of them crashing to the floor. Ray struggled as Johnnie caught his arm, cranked it behind his back, lifted and hauled him to his feet. Johnnie caught sight of the club's big Asian bouncer moving toward them, but he didn't seem to be in much of a hurry. Guess he'd got word about the pervert, too.<br><br>Carroll squirmed in his grasp. "What the fuck? Who the hell are you?"<br><br>"I'm your worst nightmare," Johnnie said, cranking the arm a little higher, eliciting a satisfying grunt of pain. "I'm the guy who's gonna make sure you get back to Houston safe and sound." Ray stumbled a couple of times as Johnnie's heavy frame propelled him forward, slamming him into the wall beside the door. "I'm the guy who's gonna put your sorry, sick ass back in jail."<br><br>The moment the song ended and she stepped down from the stage, Amy started to tremble. <em>Angel,</em> she reminded herself. <em>Angel, not Amy.</em><br><br>"You okay?" Her roommate walked toward her, Babs McClure, Sugar Babs, she used as her stage name. She was five foot seven with a curvy figure and chin-length dark brown hair she sometimes covered with a hot-pink wig.<br><br>Amy managed to nod. "I will be in a minute." It was one thing to be out there beneath the spotlights, dancing almost naked as Angel Fontaine, another entirely to be just a normal woman again. Onstage, she could fool herself into thinking she <em>was</em> Angel, a woman who enjoyed every catcall, every wolf whistle from the men she danced in front of without her clothes. An illusion she worked tirelessly to achieve.<br><br>But it didn't last long once she stepped out of the spotlight.<br><br>"That was quite a scene." Babs cocked her head toward the side door where the brawny, dark-haired man had just hauled a scummy-looking customer out of the club.<br><br>Amy followed Babs's gaze. As if she hadn't noticed the brawl just a few feet in front of the stage.<br><br>"Dante says the creep that guy busted is into kiddie porn."<br><br>Amy shuddered. "He certainly looks the part." She crossed the backstage area and started up the stairs leading to the studio apartment she and Babs shared above the club. "So I guess the other guy is a cop or something."<br><br>"Or something." Babs fell into step beside her, pulled off her pink wig and ranked a hand through her dark hair. "He was in here last night, too."<br><br>"I saw him."<br><br>Babs grinned. "Hard to miss a guy who looks like that."<br><br>Amy grinned back. "No kidding." Six feet of solid muscle, barrel-chested with a thick neck and shoulders. As he'd walked&#x2014;more like swaggered&#x2014;toward the stage, she'd noticed a tattoo of an eagle on his very impressive biceps. Every move he made spoke of power and strength, and in a rugged, masculine way, he was handsome.<br><br>"I asked Tate about him," Babs said. "Says his name is John Riggs. He's an ex-Army Ranger. Does P.I. work and pretty much anything else he can make a buck at." Babs rolled her eyes. "What a hunk."<br><br>Just hearing the words brought his image to mind: dark brown hair and eyes such a deep brown they looked black, strong jaw roughened by the shadow of a beard. He was the kind of guy who should have <em>Dangerous</em> stamped on his forehead.<br><br>Amy's mind slipped back to her performance onstage and the way he had looked at her, his eyes following her every move. She had never felt a gaze so intense.<br><br>It was late, nearly closing. Amy blew out a breath, suddenly exhausted.<br><br>"You look like you could use a cup of coffee," Babs said as they reached the small apartment they shared and Amy unlocked the door. There were other small apartments down the hall, cheap places for the girls to live. "I put on a fresh pot before I went downstairs."<br><br>"Sounds good." The rich aroma filled the room as she stepped inside. She and Babs hadn't known each other long yet Babs watched out for her. She was Amy's only confidante, the only person who knew the truth, knew she wasn't really an exotic dancer, had never done anything in her entire life remotely as wild as what she was doing now.<br><br>She wasn't a stripper, a pole dancer, a lap dancer or anything the least bit similar. She was a schoolteacher from Michigan, a woman who had absolutely no business being naked up onstage.<br><br>They crossed the studio apartment: two single beds, a kitchenette, and a small living area with a sofa and chair. Babs went to the kitchen counter and took down two mugs, pouring coffee into each one. Amy grabbed her robe from the hook beside the door, slipped it on and breathed a sigh of relief once she was more decently covered. Babs was still wearing her dark blue satin cocktail waitress costume, sexy but no worse than the bikinis women wore on the beach.<br><br>She took the mug Babs held out to her and they carried them over to the tiny round table in the corner.<br><br>"So what about the hunk?" Babs asked, watching her over the rim of her cup.<br><br>Amy's blond brows went up. "What about him?"<br><br>"He was certainly giving you the eye."<br><br>Amy just shrugged. "When you're up there naked, they all give you the eye."<br><br>"This was different&#x2014;and don't tell me you didn't notice."<br><br>Oh, she'd noticed all right. She could feel the heat in those dark eyes all the way across the room. It was what that hot look did to her that was startling. The Kitty Cat Club was filled with men every night. None of them made her stomach flip the way a single look from John Riggs had. Two nights in a row, he'd sat in the shadows watching, his fierce gaze singularly focused on her. At the same time he seemed aware of every other person in the room.<br><br>"He got his man tonight." Amy sighed. "We won't be seeing him again."<br><br>Babs sipped her coffee. "Wanna bet?"<br><br>Amy glanced up. "You don't think he'll come back because of me?"<br><br>"I've been doing this for almost three years, hon. One thing you learn to recognize is when a man is interested. And let me tell you, honey, John Riggs has a major interest in you."<br><br>Her stomach contracted. If she closed her eyes, she could almost feel the heat in those dark eyes burning into her. "You're crazy. He was here on business, that's all."<br><br>"Five bucks?"<br><br>Amy laughed. "You're on."<br><br></p><h2>Dream Of The Unified Field</h2><p><p>The 1996 Pulitzer winner in poetry and a major collection, Jorie Graham's <em>The Dream of the United Field: Selected Poems 1974-1994</em> spans twenty years of writing and includes generous selections from her first five books: <em>Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts, The End of Beauty, Region of Unlikeness,</em>and <em>Materialism.</em></p></p><p>This collection of Jorie Graham&#39;s poetry spans twenty years of writing with selections from her five previous volumes of poetry, including Erosion and Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts.

Patrick O'Brian's biography of naturalist, explorer and co-founder of Australia, Joseph Banks, is narrative history at its finest. Published to rave reviews, it reveals Banks to be a man of enduring importance, and establishes itself as a classic of exploration.<br> <br> "It is in his description of that arduous three-year voyage [on the ship Endeavor] that Mr. O'Brian is at his most brilliant. . . . He makes us understand what life within this wooden world was like, with its 94 male souls, two dogs, a cat and a goat."&#x2014;Linda Colley, <i>New York Times</i><br> <br> "An absorbing, finely written overview, meant for the general reader, of a major figure in the history of natural science."&#x2014;Frank Stewart, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> <br> "[This book is] the definitive biography of an extraordinary subject."&#x2014;Robert Taylor, <i>Boston Globe</i><br> <br> "His skill at narrative and his extensive knowledge of the maritime history . . . give him a definite leg up in telling this . . . story."&#x2014;Tom Clark, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p></p><p>Joseph Banks (1743-1820) led a life of great adventure. As a naturalist, he accompanied Captain James Cook on expeditions to Australia and Tahiti, where he cataloged new species of plants and animals; as an explorer, he helped chart sea passages along the coast of Canada to the Arctic. He was also at the center of power in his time, enjoying an on-again, off-again friendship with King George III and cultivating acquaintances with the leading scientists and statesmen of his time. Patrick O&#39;Brian, well known for his captivating seafaring novels, brings dramatic flair to retelling the incidents of Banks&#39;s life, which are closely tied to the expansion of the British empire.O'Brian, creator of the popular fiction series depicting the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars, demonstrates his considerable research talents with this biography. Banks (1743-1820), who served for over 40 years as president of the Royal Society, Britain's oldest scientific institution, was the quintessential Englishman of this period. As a young botanist, Banks accompanied Captain Cook on a global voyage that culminated in the "discovery" of Australia. Later Banks helped to establish London's Kew Gardens as the world's greatest botanical center. A man of unusual energy and influence, he was instrumental in promoting the careers of other notable men. His considerable correspondence and journals have allowed O'Brian to write a solid biography that is rich in scholarship and engaging in style.

This celebration of nearly fifty years of groundbreaking performance art demonstrated once again that Marina Abramovi&#x107; is truly a force of nature.<br><br>The child of Communist war-hero parents under Tito&#x2019;s regime in postwar Yugoslavia, she was raised with a relentless work ethic. Even as she was beginning to build an international artistic career, Marina lived at home under her mother&#x2019;s abusive control, strictly obeying a 10 p.m. curfew. But nothing could quell her insatiable curiosity, her desire to connect with people, or her distinctly Balkan sense of humor&#x2014;all of which informs her art and her life. The beating heart of <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is an operatic love story&#x2014;a twelve-year collaboration with fellow performance artist Ulay, much of which was spent penniless in a van traveling across Europe&#x2014;a relationship that began to unravel and came to a dramatic end atop the Great Wall of China.<br><br>Marina&#x2019;s story, by turns moving, epic, and dryly funny, informs an incomparable artistic career that involves pushing her body past the limits of fear, pain, exhaustion, and danger in an uncompromising quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. A remarkable work of performance in its own right, <i>Walk Through Walls</i> is a vivid and powerful rendering of the unparalleled life of an extraordinary artist.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2016:</strong> She&#x2019;s nuts. There will be devotees devouring <em>Walk Through Walls</em> who will revel in the genius of performance artist Marina Abramovi&#x107;. But for those approaching this frank and fascinating memoir not knowing much about her, that would be an understandable assessment. After all, Abramovi&#x107; has willingly had a loaded pistol pointed at her head, been maimed by strangers, she&#x2019;s lost consciousness after laying in the middle of a gas-soaked star set aflame (and that&#x2019;s just for starters). It&#x2019;s an odd career trajectory considering Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s antithetical upbringing under the hem of a tyrannical mother who insisted she be home by ten at the tender age of...24. Danica Rosi&#x107; was seemingly ashamed of her daughter&#x2019;s artistic endeavors, and yet when she died, Abramovi&#x107; discovered that she had stashed away newspaper clippings about her performances&#x2014;holey clippings where she had carefully cut out her daughter&#x2019;s often nude (and sometimes mutilated) visage. You might be tempted to excise the more disturbing aspects of Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s narrative as well, but like a gruesome car crash, it&#x2019;s tough to look away. And if you find yourself cringing, well then, that&#x2019;s the point. One of the main purposes of Abramovi&#x107;&#x2019;s art--of her life--is to learn how to confront and transcend the uncomfortable&#x2014;the physically and the emotionally painful. You may come away from <em>Walk Through Walls</em> thinking, yeah, this lady, she cray. But there is something to be said for someone with the audacity to run towards what the rest of us are only too happy to flee. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>Raised in Yugoslavia, legendary performance artist Marina Abramovic now makes her primary residence in New York and in the Hudson Valley.</p><h2>Tyndale</h2><p><p>It was an outlawed book, a text so dangerous &#x201c;it could onlybe countered by the most vicious burnings, of books and men and women.&#x201d; Butwhat book could incite such violence and bloodshed?

It was a story that generations of Americans have also come to know through Dorothea Lange's unforgettable photos of migrant families struggling to make a living in Depression-torn California. Now in James N. Gregory's pathbreaking <em>American Exodus</em>, there is at last an historical study that moves beyond the fiction of the 1930s to uncover the full meaning of these events.<br> <em>American Exodus</em> takes us back to the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and the war boom influx of the 1940s to explore the experiences of the more than one million Oklahomans, Arkansans, Texans, and Missourians who sought opportunities in California. Gregory reaches into the migrants' lives to reveal not only their economic trials but also their impact on California's culture and society. He traces the development of an "Okie subculture" that over the years has grown into an essential element in California's cultural landscape.<br> Gregory vividly depicts how Southwesterners brought with them on their journey west an allegiance to evangelical Protestantism, "plain-folk American" values, and a love of country music. These values gave Okies an expanding cultural presence their new home. In their neighborhoods, often called "Little Oklahomas," they created a community of churches and saloons, of church-goers and good-old-boys, mixing stern-minded religious thinking with hard-drinking irreverence. Today, Baptist and Pentecostal churches abound in this region, and from Gene Autry, "Oklahoma's singing cowboy," to Woody Guthrie, Bob Wills, and Merle Haggard, the special concerns of Southwesterners have long dominated the country music industry in California. The legacy of the Dust Bowl migration can also be measured in political terms. Throughout California and especially in the San Joaquin Valley Okies have implanted their own brand of populist conservatism.<br> The consequences reach far beyond California. The Dust Bowl migration was part of a larger heartland diaspora that has sent millions of Southerners and rural Midwesterners to the nation's northern and western industrial perimeter. <em>American Exodus</em> is the first book to examine the cultural implications of that massive 20th-century population shift. In this rich account of the experiences and impact of these migrant heartlanders, Gregory fills an important gap in recent American social history.<br></p><p><br><strong>James N. Gregory</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.<br>"An important and readable book about one of the significant episodes of the Great Depression. The story is told from multiple points of view and illustrated with a number of striking pictures--some of them not often seen. This book would be useful in a number of different kinds of<br>courses."--William H. Goetzmann, The Univ. of Texas<br><br>"...a profoundly impressive book....American Exodus is a major contribution to our understanding of regional, cultural, and political history in the United States. It deserves the widest possible readership."--Bill C. Malone, The Journal of Southern History _<br><br>"[A] stunning book....The impressive range of source material, from government documents to graffiti to country music to cliometrics is fashioned and reshaped to form a vivid yet subtle portrait of generation of Americans on the move....A masterpiece of reflection, imagination and research, a<br>book that advances our historical understanding, with a narrative skillfully and vividly told. In sum, a testimony to what the historical profession and history are presumed to be about."--OAH Ray Allen Billington Prize Committee<br><br>"We have had many other essays and books on the Okie migrants who entered California in the 1930s, but no one has done so comprehensive and masterful a job of telling their history as James Gregory. He has uncovered a vast literature on these people, including their own newspapers and poetry,<br>and he has derived from it a convincing portrait of both their strengths and weaknesses. Best of all, he succeeds in giving them their due. They are, as he reveals, a major 20th-century American subculture, with roots in the Old Southwest and a life that has endured beyond the thirties down to our<br>own time. The Okies must be reckoned with, and this book must be read to understand [them]."--Donald E. Worster, University of Kansas<br><br>"American Exodus takes us beyond the Dorothea Lange photographs and the Hollywood stereotypes to the heart of that complex story of a plain folk culture transplanted across a continent in the midst of the great depression. In John Steinbeck, the Okie's found their novelist; in Jim Gregory<br>they have found their historian."--Dan T. Carter, Emory University<br><br>"Clearly the best book that has been written about the Okies."--Roger Daniels, University of Cincinnati<br><br>"[A] remarkable book....Gregory has a fine ear for music and a fine eye for quotation, and combines these with vigorous social analysis. American Exodus is a fine achievement."--Otis L. Graham, Jr., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill<br><br>"It will fit in well with my 20th-century California class."--Kathy Olmsted, University of California, Davis</p><h2>Financial Accounting (What&#39;s New in Accounting)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in introductory financial accounting.</i> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> <br> </b> </p> <p> <b>A student-centered approach to financial accounting</b> </p> <p> </p> <p>Accounting is the language of business, and understanding the role accounting plays in business is critical to a student&#x2019;s success in earning a business degree. <b> <i>Financial Accounting</i> </b> puts the focus on the purpose of Accounting in business.

But does it seem as though you and your spouse are speaking two different languages? "New York Times" bestselling author Dr. Gary Chapman guides couples in identifying, understanding, and speaking their spouse's primary love language--quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, or physical touch. </p><p>By learning the five love languages, you and your spouse will discover your unique love languages and learn practical steps in truly loving each other. Chapters are categorized by love language for easy reference, and each one ends with specific, simple steps to express a specific language to your spouse and guide your marriage in the right direction. A newly designed love languages assessment will help you understand and strengthen your relationship. You can build a lasting, loving marriage together. <br> Gary Chapman hosts a nationally syndicated daily radio program called "A Love Language Minute" that can be heard on more than 150 radio stations as well as the weekly syndicated program "Building Relationships with Gary Chapman," which can both be heard on fivelovelanguages.com. <br> "The Five Love Languages" is a consistent new York Times bestseller - with over 5 million copies sold and translated into 38 languages. This book is a sales phenomenon, with each year outselling the prior for 16 years running! </p><p>Includes a promotional code to gain exclusive online access to the new comprehensive love languages assessment.<br></p></p><p>Unhappiness in marriage often has a simple root cause: we speak different love languages, believes Dr. Gary Chapman. While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their "love tank." Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse&#x2019;s &#x2013; and your own &#x2013; love language? Chapman&#x2019;s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com set). Each section of the journal corresponds with a chapter from the book, offering opportunities for deeper reflection on your marriage. </p><p> Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like &#x2013;hoping the feelings of affection will follow later&#x2013; a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. "Love is a choice," says Chapman. "And either partner can start the process today." --<i>Cindy Crosby</i>.

Scholarly yet readable, it covers the entire repertoire from the Renaissance to the late 20th century and incorporates a bibliography of 1 100 sources for further study.</p><p>When F. E. Kirby published A Short History of Keyboard Music in 1966, scholars and keyboard players welcomed it as the first detailed historical interpretation of music for organ, harpsichord, clavichord, and piano. In this book, which is comparable in length but substantially different in content, Kirby focuses on music for the piano &#34;in the fine-art or classical tradition&#34;, providing an in-depth survey of music for piano solo, and including discussions of important compositions for piano duet and two pianos. Beginning with early types of keyboard music that influenced the first music for the instrument in the seventeenth century, and ending with the bold, iconoclastic works of the late twentieth century, Kirby provides a scholarly yet readable overview of the literature, drawing on the results of the most recent research. Concerned with the historical context of the works, the author traces the development of the composers&#39; styles in light of the times in which they lived. With an emphasis on principal composers and important compositions, the book is an excellent introduction for anyone interested in the development of the great repertoire of piano music. Incorporating an extensive topical bibliography of more than 1100 sources for further reading - likely the largest ever compiled - and illustrated throughout with music examples, this volume is indispensable to students and teachers at both the graduate and advanced undergraduate levels, music historians, and anyone interested in music literature.F. E. Kirby is professor emeritus at Lake Forest College in Illinois.

This edition of the Ethiopian text is edited by Gerald Hausman, with an introduction by Ziggy Marley.</p></p><p>What did Jamaican reggae singer Bob Marley and Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia have in common? A love for the <i>Kebra Negast</i>, holy book of Ethiopian Christians and Jamaican Rastafarians. Contemporary scholars date the <i>Kebra Negast</i> to the 14th century, but it retells the stories of much earlier Biblical times, one very important story in particular. According to the <i>Kebra Negast</i>, the Israelites' Ark of the Covenant was spirited away to the ancient kingdom of Ethiopia by wise King Solomon's own son, offspring of the union between Solomon and the exotic Queen Makeda of Ethiopia (a.k.a. the Queen of Sheba). Gerald Hausman, a consummate storyteller of native traditions, presents the core narrative of the <i>Kebra Negast</i>, from Adam to the rise of the Ethiopian Solomonid dynasty. On top of this, he injects his own encounters with Rastafarians during his travels in Jamaica--dreadlocked Rastas as modern-day Samsons, their unwavering faith in Jah, and a rare outsider's glimpse at the Nyabinghi ceremony. The combination of ancient tale and modern belief give Hausman's <i>Kebra Negast</i> the rich flavor of enduring truth. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p><b>Gerald Hausman</b> calls himself a "native of the world" after living in so many places in the United States and the West Indies. He spent more than twenty years in New Mexico where many of his American Indian folktales were collected and published. Born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1945, Hausman has been a storyteller almost since birth. His more than 70 books attest to his love of folklore, a passion instilled by his mother who painted the portraits of Native American chiefs. During his thirty-five years as a storyteller, Gerald has entertained children of all ages at such places as The Kennedy Center, Harvard University, St John's College and in schools from one end of the country to the other. Five audio books have come out in recent years and two of Gerald's books have been made into animated and folkloric films. His books have also been translated into a dozen foreign languages.</p></p><h2>The Bible: Genesis, Exodus, The Song of Solomon</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

My first thought on waking was to tell my best friend about the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Tom�s Aguilar was a classmate who devoted his free time and his talent to the invention of wonderfully ingenious contraptions of dubious practicality, like the aerostatic dart or the dynamo spinning top. I pictured us both, equipped with flashlights and compasses, uncovering the mysteries of those bibliographic catacombs. Who better than Tom�s to share my secret? Then, remembering my promise, I decided that circumstances advised me to adopt what in detective novels is termed a different modus operandi. At noon I approached my father to quiz him about the book and about Juli�n Carax-both world famous, I assumed. My plan was to get my hands on his complete works and read them all by the end of the week. To my surprise, I discovered that my father, a natural-born librarian and a walking lexicon of publishers' catalogs and oddities, had never heard of The Shadow of the Wind or Juli�n Carax. Intrigued, he examined the printing history on the back of the title page for clues. </p><p> "It says here that this copy is part of an edition of twenty-five hundred printed in Barcelona by Cabestany Editores, in June 1936." </p><p> "Do you know the publishing house?" </p><p> "It closed down years ago. But, wait, this is not the original. The first edition came out in November 1935 but was printed in Paris....Published by Galiano &amp; Neuval. Doesn't ring a bell." </p><p> "So is this a translation?" </p><p> "It doesn't say so. From what I can see, the text must be the original one." </p><p> "A book in Spanish, first published in France?" </p><p> "It's not that unusual, not in times like these," my father put in. "Perhaps Barcel= can help us...." </p><p> Gustavo Barcel= was an old colleague of my father's who now owned a cavernous establishment on Calle Fernando with a commanding position in the city's secondhand-book trade. Perpetually affixed to his mouth was an unlit pipe that impregnated his person with the aroma of a Persian market. He liked to describe himself as the last romantic, and he was not above claiming that a remote line in his ancestry led directly to Lord Byron himself. As if to prove this connection, Barcel= fashioned his wardrobe in the style of a nineteenth-century dandy. His casual attire consisted of a cravat, white patent leather shoes, and a plain glass monocle that, according to malicious gossip, he did not remove even in the intimacy of the lavatory. Flights of fancy aside, the most significant relative in his lineage was his begetter, an industrialist who had become fabulously wealthy by questionable means at the end of the nineteenth century. According to my father, Gustavo Barcel= was, technically speaking, loaded, and his palatial bookshop was more of a passion than a business. He loved books unreservedly, and-although he denied this categorically-if someone stepped into his bookshop and fell in love with a tome he could not afford, Barcel= would lower its price, or even give it away, if he felt that the buyer was a serious reader and not an accidental browser. Barcel= also boasted an elephantine memory allied to a pedantry that matched his demeanor and the sonority of his voice. If anyone knew about odd books, it was he. That afternoon, after closing the shop, my father suggested that we stroll along to the Els Quatre Gats, a cafT on Calle Montsi=, where Barcel= and his bibliophile knights of the round table gathered to discuss the finer points of decadent poets, dead languages, and neglected, moth-ridden masterpieces. <br> </p><p> Els Quatre Gats was just a five-minute walk from our house and one of my favorite haunts. My parents had met there in 1932, and I attributed my one-way ticket into this world in part to the old cafT's charms. Stone dragons guarded a lamplit fatade anchored in shadows. Inside, voices seemed shaded by the echoes of other times. Accountants, dreamers, and would-be geniuses shared tables with the specters of Pablo Picasso, Isaac AlbTniz, Federico Garcfa Lorca, and Salvador Dalf. There any poor devil could pass for a historical figure for the price of a small coffee. </p><p> "Sempere, old man," proclaimed Barcel= when he saw my father come in. "Hail the prodigal son. To what do we owe the honor?" </p><p> "You owe the honor to my son, Daniel, Don Gustavo. He's just made a discovery." </p><p> "Well, then, pray come and sit down with us, for we must celebrate this ephemeral event," he announced. </p><p> "Ephemeral?" I whispered to my father. </p><p> "Barcel= can express himself only in frilly words," my father whispered back. "Don't say anything, or he'll get carried away." </p><p> The lesser members of the coterie made room for us in their circle, and Barcel=, who enjoyed flaunting his generosity in public, insisted on treating us. </p><p> "How old is the lad?" inquired Barcel=, inspecting me out of the corner of his eye. </p><p> "Almost eleven," I announced. </p><p> Barcel= flashed a sly smile. </p><p> "In other words, ten. Don't add on any years, you rascal. Life will see to that without your help." </p><p> A few of his chums grumbled in assent. Barcel= signaled to a waiter of such remarkable decrepitude that he looked as if he should be declared a national landmark. </p><p> "A cognac for my friend Sempere, from the good bottle, and a cinnamon milk shake for the young one-he's a growing boy. Ah, and bring us some bits of ham, but spare us the delicacies you brought us earlier, eh? If we fancy rubber, we'll call for Pirelli tires." </p><p> The waiter nodded and left, dragging his feet. </p><p> "I hate to bring up the subject," Barcel= said, "but how can there be jobs? In this country nobody ever retires, not even after they're dead. Just look at El Cid. I tell you, we're a hopeless case." </p><p> He sucked on his cold pipe, eyes already scanning the book in my hands. Despite his pretentious fatade and his verbosity, Barcel= could smell good prey the way a wolf scents blood. </p><p> "Let me see," he said, feigning disinterest. "What have we here?" </p><p> I glanced at my father. He nodded approvingly. Without further ado, I handed Barcel= the book. The bookseller greeted it with expert hands. His pianist's fingers quickly explored its texture, consistency, and condition. He located the page with the publication and printer's notices and studied it with Holmesian flair. The rest watched in silence, as if awaiting a miracle, or permission to breathe again. </p><p> "Carax. Interesting," he murmured in an inscrutable tone. </p><p> I held out my hand to recover the book. Barcel= arched his eyebrows but gave it back with an icy smile. </p><p> "Where did you find it, young man?" </p><p> "It's a secret," I answered, knowing that my father would be smiling to himself. Barcel= frowned and looked at my father. "Sempere, my dearest old friend, because it's you and because of the high esteem I hold you in, and in honor of the long and profound friendship that unites us like brothers, let's call it at forty duros, end of story." </p><p> "You'll have to discuss that with my son," my father pointed out. "The book is his." </p><p> Barcel= granted me a wolfish smile. "What do you say, laddie? Forty duros isn't bad for a first sale....Sempere, this boy of yours will make a name for himself in the business." </p><p> The choir cheered his remark. Barcel= gave me a triumphant look and pulled out his leather wallet. He ceremoniously counted out two hundred pesetas, which in those days was quite a fortune, and handed them to me. But I just shook my head. Barcel= scowled. </p><p> "Dear boy, greed is most certainly an ugly, not to say mortal, sin. Be sensible. Call me crazy, but I'll raise that to sixty duros, and you can open a retirement fund. At your age you must start thinking of the future." </p><p> I shook my head again. Barcel= shot a poisonous look at my father through his monocle. </p><p> "Don't look at me," said my father. "I'm only here as an escort." </p><p> Barcel= sighed and peered at me closely. </p><p> "Let's see, junior. <i>What</i> is it you want?" </p><p> "What I want is to know who Juli�n Carax is and where I can find other books he's written." </p><p> Barcel= chuckled and pocketed his wallet, reconsidering his adversary. </p><p> "Goodness, a scholar. Sempere, what do you feed the boy?" </p><p> The bookseller leaned toward me confidentially, and for a second I thought he betrayed a look of respect that had not been there a few moments earlier. </p><p> "We'll make a deal," he said. "Tomorrow, Sunday, in the afternoon, drop by the Ateneo library and ask for me. Bring your precious find with you so that I can examine it properly, and I'll tell you what I know about Juli�n Carax. Quid pro quo." </p><p> "Quid pro what?" </p><p> "Latin, young man. There's no such thing as dead languages, only dormant minds. Paraphrasing, it means that you can't get something for nothing, but since I like you, I'm going to do you a favor." </p><p> The man's oratory could kill flies in midair, but I suspected that if I wanted to find out anything about Juli�n Carax, I'd be well advised to stay on good terms with him. I proffered my most saintly smile in delight at his Latin outpourings. </p><p> "Remember, tomorrow, in the Ateneo," pronounced the bookseller. "But bring the book, or there's no deal." </p><p> "Fine." </p><p> Our conversation slowly merged into the murmuring of the other members of the coffee set. The discussion turned to some documents found in the basement of El Escorial that hinted at the possibility that Don Miguel de Cervantes had in fact been the nom de plume of a large, hairy lady of letters from Toledo. Barcel= seemed distracted, not tempted to claim a share in the debate. He remained quiet, observing me from his fake monocle with a masked smile. Or perhaps he was only looking at the book I held in my hands. </p><p> --from <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> by Carlos Ruiz Safon, Copyright � 2004 Carlos Ruiz Safon, published by The Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., all rights reserved, reprinted with permission from the publisher." <br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Creating the Not So Big House: Insights and Ideas for the New American Home (Susanka)</h2><p><p><strong><i>The Not So Big House</i> </strong>created a movement that is changing the way people think about the American home. That groundbreaking book proposed a new blueprint for the American home: a house that values quality over quantity, with an emphasis on comfort and beauty, a high level of detail, and a floor plan designed for today's informal lifestyle.</p> <p><strong><i>Creating the Not So Big House</i></strong> is the blueprint in action. Focusing on key design strategies such as visual weight, layering, and framed openings, Sarah Susanka takes an up-close look at 25 houses designed according to Not So Big principles. The houses are from all over North America in a rich variety of styles -- from a tiny New York apartment to a southwestern adobe, a traditional Minnesota farmhouse, and a cottage community in the Pacific Northwest. Whether new or remodeled, these one-of-a-kind homes provide all the inspiration you need to create your own Not So Big House.</p></p><p>Sarah Susanka has a not-so-insignificant idea in <i>Creating the Not So Big House</i>. She contrasts the glamorous, glossy-photo house plans of vaulted ceilings and palatial living rooms with the livable, day-to-day pleasure of cozy window seats and comfortable breakfast nooks, and her conclusion is resonating with families across the country: bigger but shoddier isn't better than smaller and well made. Descriptors like "spacious" and "expansive" fill the real-estate promos, but Susanka seeks the elusive yet affordable qualities that turn a house into a home. And she provides more than mere ideals around which to rally. She selected 25 house designs, from a southwestern adobe to a Minnesota farmhouse to a New York apartment to a Rhode Island summer cottage, and she profiles each home in great and well-illustrated detail.<p> Her ideas for interior as well as exterior views, airy stairways, diagonal views, and framed openings translate well in an array of different houses appropriate to childless couples and large families, as well as hot climes in Texas and cooler regions in Vermont. There are traditional designs to fit in with Massachusetts styling and contemporary designs to adapt to California cliffs, and they range from country spaces to suburban homes to city apartments.</p><p> Susanka selected house plans that are available for sale, because her purpose is to make affordable quality housing accessible to the general public, but they're also presented as catalysts for your own designs, because the house that worked for one person might inspire the plan that would work best for you. Whether you're in the market for a new house, want pragmatic renovation ideas, or are interested in the concept of space-saving abodes from a city-planning, philosophical perspective, Susanka's book is an eye-opener and a mind-expander, providing conceptual and practical tools to assist you in planning your own livable home. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Sarah Susanka is one of the leading residential architects in the United States.

Marsuvees Black asked, examining his fingernails. </p> <p> Strange behavior for a man interviewing for such a lofty position. </p> <p> "Thirty-seven," David said. "And they may be only thirteen or fourteen years old, but I wouldn't call them children. They are students, yes, but most of them already have the intelligence of a postgraduate. Believe me, you've never met anyone like them." </p> <p> Black settled back in the tall leather chair and pressed his thumbs and fingers together to form a triangle. He sighed. The monk from the Nevada desert was a strange one, to be sure. But David Abraham, director of the monastery's project, had to admit that genius was often accompanied by eccentric behavior. </p> <p> "Thirty-seven special children who could one day change humanity's understanding of the world," Black said. "I think I could pull myself from my desert solitude for such a noble task. Wouldn't you agree? God knows I've been in solitude for three years now." </p> <p> "You'll have to take that up with God," David said. "With or without you, our project will one day change the world. I can guarantee you that." </p> <p> "Then why do you need me? You're aware of my"--he hesitated--"that I'm not exactly your typical monk." </p> <p> "Naturally. I would say you're hardly a monk at all. You've spent a few years atoning for rather gratuitous sins, and for that I think you possess a unique appreciation for our struggle with evil." </p> <p> "What makes you think I've beaten my demons?" </p> <p> "Have you?" </p> <p> "Do we ever?" </p> <p> "Yes, we do," David said. </p> <p> "If any man has truly beaten his demons, I have. But the struggle isn't over. There are new battles every day. I don't know why you need a conflicted man like me." </p> <p> David thought a moment. "I don't need you. But God might.

Whether painful, funny, or matter-of-fact, these plain-spoken accounts will move and educate any reader, gay or not, from farm or city.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;When I was fifteen, the milkman who came to get our milk was beautiful. This is when I was really getting horny to do something with another guy. I waited every day for him to come. I couldn&#x2019;t even talk to him, couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to say. I just stood there, watching him, wondering if he knew why.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry Bauer, Minnesota<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;When I go back home, I feel a real connection with the land&#x2014;a tremendous feeling, spiritual in a way. It makes me want to go out into a field and take my shoes off and put my feet right on the dirt, establish a real physical connection with that place. I get homesick a lot, but I don&#x2019;t know if I could ever go back there and live. It&#x2019;s not the kind of place that would welcome me if I lived openly, the way that I would like to live. I would be shunned.&#x201d;&#x2014;Martin Scherz, Nebraska<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;If there is a checklist to see if your kid is queer, I must have hit every one of them&#x2014;all sorts of big warning signs. I was always interested in a lot of the traditional queen things&#x2014;clothes, cooking, academics, music, theater. A farm boy listening to show tunes? My parents must have seen it coming.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joe Shulka, Wisconsin<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;My favorite show when I was growing up was &#x2018;The Waltons&#x2019;. The show&#x2019;s values comforted me, and I identified with John-Boy, the sensitive son who wanted to be a writer. He belonged there on the mountain with his family, yet he sensed that he was different and that he was often misunderstood. Sometimes I still feel like a misfit, even with gay people.&#x201d;&#x2014;Connie Sanders, Illinois<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Agriculture is my life. I like working with farm people, although they don&#x2019;t really understand me.

This groundbreaking new book connects each welding technique to a useful and creative take-home project, making exercises both practical and personal--and avoiding the tedium of traditional, repetitive welding practices. To further enhance the learning process, every welding project includes a set of prints with specifications, like those used in production fabrication shops. This full-featured approach to skill-building reflects the reality of professional welding, where following prints and instructions precisely and laying out, cutting out, and assembling weldment accurately are just as essential as high-quality welding. The included projects are small to conserve materials during the learning process, but detailed instructions and abundant photos and illustrations guide you through a wide range of fabrication skills. Key steps and techniques within the small projects are also linked to larger projects presented at the end of each chapter, enabling you to apply what you have learned by fabricating and welding something more substantial. This thorough, reader-friendly book also prepares you for real-world success by covering shop math and measurement, time and material tracking, and invoicing.</p><p>Larry Jeffus is a welder with over 55 years of experience, and he maintains his own well-equipped welding shop. In his career he has passed many welding certification tests in a wide variety of processes, positions, and material types and thicknesses.

It&#x2019;s not even twice upon a time. It&#x2019;s hundreds of times, over and over, every time someone opens up the pages of this dusty old book.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver,&#x201d; my best friend says. &#x201c;Checkmate.&#x201d;<br> <br>I follow Frump&#x2019;s gaze and stare down at the chessboard, which isn&#x2019;t really a chessboard at all. It&#x2019;s just squares scratched onto the sand of Everafter Beach, and a bunch of accommodating fairies who don&#x2019;t mind acting as pawns and bishops and queens. There isn&#x2019;t a chess set in the story, so we have to make do with what we&#x2019;ve got, and of course we have to clean up all evidence when we&#x2019;re done, or else someone might assume that there is more to the story than what they know.<br> <br><br> <br>I can&#x2019;t remember when I first realized that life, as I knew it, wasn&#x2019;t real. That this role I performed over and over was just that&#x2014;a role. And that in order for me to play it, there had to be another party involved&#x2014;namely one of those large, round, flat faces that blurred the sky above us every time the story began. The relationships you see on the page aren&#x2019;t always as they seem. When we&#x2019;re not acting our parts, we&#x2019;re all just free to go about our business. It&#x2019;s quite complicated, really. I&#x2019;m Prince Oliver, but I&#x2019;m not Prince Oliver. When the book is closed, I can stop pretending that I&#x2019;m interested in Seraphima or that I&#x2019;m fighting a dragon, and instead I can hang out with Frump or taste the concoctions Queen Maureen likes to dream up in the kitchen or take a dip in the ocean with the pirates, who are actually quite nice fellows. In other words, we all have lives outside the lives that we play when a Reader opens the book. For everyone else here, that knowledge is enough. They&#x2019;re happy repeating the story endlessly, and staying trapped onstage even when the Readers are gone. But me, I&#x2019;ve always wondered. It stands to reason that if I have a life outside of this story, so do the Readers whose faces float above us. And they&#x2019;re not trapped inside the book. So where exactly are they? And what do they do when the book is closed?<br> <br>Once, a Reader&#x2014;a very young one&#x2014;knocked the book over and it fell open on a page that has no one but me written into it. For a full hour, I watched the Other-world go by. These giants stacked bricks made of wood, with letters written on their sides, creating monstrous buildings. They dug their hands into a deep table filled with the same sort of sand we have on Everafter Beach. They stood in front of easels, like the one Rapscullio likes to use when he paints, but these artists used a unique style&#x2014;dipping their hands into the paint and smearing it across the paper in swirls of color. Finally, one of the Others, who looked to be as old as Queen Maureen, leaned forward and frowned. &#x201c;Children! This is not how we treat books,&#x201d; she said, before shutting me out.<br> <br>When I told the others what I had seen, they just shrugged. Queen Maureen suggested I see Orville about my strange dreams and ask for a sleeping potion. Frump, who is my best friend both inside the story and out, believed me. &#x201c;What difference does it make, Oliver?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Why waste time and energy thinking about a place or a person you&#x2019;ll never be?&#x201d; Immediately I regretted bringing it up. Frump wasn&#x2019;t always a dog&#x2014;he was written into the story as Figgins, my best buddy from childhood, who was transformed by Rapscullio into a common hound. Because it&#x2019;s only a flashback of text, the only time he&#x2019;s ever read he&#x2019;s seen as a dog&#x2014;which is why he stays in that form even when we&#x2019;re offstage.<br> <br>Frump captures my queen. &#x201c;Checkmate,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you always beat me?&#x201d; I sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you always let me?&#x201d; Frump says, and he scratches behind his ear. &#x201c;Stupid fleas.&#x201d;<br> <br>When we&#x2019;re working, Frump doesn&#x2019;t speak&#x2014;he just barks. He follows me around like, well, a faithful pup. You&#x2019;d never guess, when he&#x2019;s acting, that in real life he&#x2019;s always bossing the rest of us around.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I saw a tear at the top of page forty-seven,&#x201d; I say as casually as I can, although I&#x2019;ve been thinking of nothing but getting back there to investigate since first spotting it. &#x201c;Want to come check it out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, Oliver. Not that again.&#x201d; Frump rolls his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like a one-trick pony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you call me?&#x201d; Socks trots closer. He&#x2019;s my trusty steed, and again, a shining example of how what you see isn&#x2019;t always what&#x2019;s true. Although he snorts and stamps with the confidence of a stallion on the pages of our world, when the book is closed he&#x2019;s a nervous mess with the self-confidence of a gnat.<br> <br>I smile at him, because if I don&#x2019;t, he&#x2019;s going to think I&#x2019;m angry at him. He&#x2019;s that sensitive. &#x201c;No, we didn&#x2019;t...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I distinctly heard the word pony...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was just an expression,&#x201d; Frump says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, now that I&#x2019;m here, tell me the truth,&#x201d; Socks says, turning in a half circle. &#x201c;This saddle totally makes my butt look fat, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say immediately, as Frump vigorously shakes his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all muscle,&#x201d; Frump says. &#x201c;In fact, I was going to ask if you&#x2019;d been working out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that to make me feel better.&#x201d; Socks sniffles. &#x201c;I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t have had that last carrot at breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You look great, Socks,&#x201d; I insist. &#x201c;Honestly.&#x201d; But he tosses his mane and sulks back toward the other side of the beach.<br> <br>Frump rolls onto his back. &#x201c;If I have to listen to that stupid horse whine one more time&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201d; I interrupt. &#x201c;What if you didn&#x2019;t have to? What if you could be anywhere&#x2014;anything&#x2014;you wanted to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>I have this dream. It&#x2019;s kind of silly, but I see myself walking down a street I&#x2019;ve never seen before, in a village I can&#x2019;t identify. A girl hurries past me, her dark hair whipping behind her like a flag, and in her haste she crashes into me. When I reach out to help her up, I feel a spark ignite between us. Her eyes are the color of honey, and I cannot turn away from them. Finally, I say, and when I kiss her, she tastes of mint and winter and nothing like Seraphima&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Frump says, interrupting me. &#x201c;How many career opportunities are there for a basset hound?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only a dog because you were written that way,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;What if you could change that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughs. &#x201c;Change it. Change the story. Yeah, that&#x2019;s a good one, Ollie. While you&#x2019;re at it, why don&#x2019;t you turn the ocean into grape juice and make the mermaids fly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maybe he&#x2019;s right, maybe it is just me. Everyone else in this book seems to be perfectly happy with the fact that they are part of a story; that they are enslaved into doing and saying the same things over and over, like in a play that gets performed for eternity. They probably think that the people in the Otherworld have the same sorts of lives we do. I guess I find it hard to believe that Readers get up at the same hour every morning and eat the same breakfast every day and go sit in the same chair for hours and have the same conversations with their parents and go to bed and wake up and do it all over again. I think more likely they lead the most incredible lives&#x2014;and by incredible, I mean: with free will. I wonder all the time what that would be like: to feel the book opening yet not beg the queen to let me go on a quest. To avoid getting trapped by fairies and run ragged by a villain. To fall in love with a girl whose eyes are the color of honey. To see someone I don&#x2019;t recognize, and whose name I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m not fussy, really. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind being a butcher instead of a prince. Or swimming across the ocean to be hailed as a legendary athlete. Or picking a fight with someone who cuts in front of me. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind doing anything other than the same old things I have done for as long as I can remember. I guess I just have to believe there&#x2019;s more to the world than what&#x2019;s inside these pages. Or maybe it&#x2019;s just that I desperately want to believe that.<br> <br>I glance around at the others. Between readings, our real personalities show. One of the trolls is working out a melody on a flute he has carved from a piece of bamboo. The fairies are doing crossword puzzles that Captain Crabbe creates for them, but they keep cheating by looking into the wizard&#x2019;s crystal ball. And Seraphima...<br> <br>She blows me a kiss, and I force a smile.<br> <br><br> <br>She&#x2019;s pretty, I suppose, with her silver hair and eyes the color of violets in the meadow near the castle. But her shoe size is bigger than her IQ. For example, she honestly believes that just because I save her over and over again as part of my job, I must truly have feelings for her.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll be honest, it&#x2019;s not a hard day&#x2019;s work to kiss a beautiful girl repeatedly. But it all starts feeling same old, same old after a while. I certainly don&#x2019;t love Seraphima, but that little detail seems to have escaped her. Which makes me feel guilty every time I kiss her, because I know she wants more from me than I&#x2019;m ever going to give her when the storybook&#x2019;s closed.<br> <br>Beside me, Frump lets out a long, mournful howl. That&#x2019;s the second reason I feel so guilty kissing Seraphima. He&#x2019;s had a crush on her for as long as I can remember, and that makes it even worse. What must it be like, watching me pretend to fall in love with the girl he&#x2019;s crazy about, day after day? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, buddy,&#x201d; I say to him. &#x201c;I wish she knew it was just for show.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not your fault,&#x201d; he replies tightly. &#x201c;Just doing what you have to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if he&#x2019;s conjured it, there is suddenly a blinding light, and our sky cracks open along a seam. &#x201c;Places!&#x201d; Frump cries, frantic. &#x201c;Everyone! Into your positions!&#x201d; He runs off to help the trolls dismantle the bridge, only so that they can rebuild it again.<br> <br>I grab my tunic and my dagger. The fairies who were our chess pieces rise like sparks and write the words SEE YOU LATER in the air before me, a trail of light as they zoom into the woods. &#x201c;Yes, and thanks again,&#x201d; I say politely, intent on hurrying to the castle for my first scene.<br> <br>What would happen, I wonder, if I was late? If I dawdled or stopped to smell the lilacs at the castle gate, so that I wasn&#x2019;t in place when the book was opened? Would it stay sealed shut? Or would the story start without me?<br> <br>Experimentally, I slow my pace, dragging my heels. But suddenly I feel a magnetic tug on the front of my tunic, propelling me through the pages. They rustle as I leap through them, my legs moving in double time while I stare down, amazed. I can hear Socks whinnying in his stall at the royal stables, and the splash of the mermaids as they dive back into the sea, and suddenly, I am standing where I am supposed to be, before the royal throne in the Great Hall, at dispute court. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time,&#x201d; Frump mutters. At the last moment there is a brilliant slice of light that opens above us, and instead of looking away like we usually do, this time I glance up.<br> <br>I can see the Reader&#x2019;s face&#x2014;a little fuzzy at the edges, sort of how the sun looks from the ocean floor. And just like when one stares at the sun, I can&#x2019;t make myself turn away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver!&#x201d; Frump hisses. &#x201c;Focus!&#x201d;<br> <br>So I turn away from those eyes, the exact color of honey; from that mouth, its lips parted just the tiniest bit, as if she might be about to speak my name. I turn away, and clear my throat, and for the hundred billionth time in my life, I speak my first line of the story.<br> <br>Save who?<br> <br>I did not write the lines I speak; they were given to me long before I remember. I mouth the words, but the actual sound is in the Reader&#x2019;s mind, not coming from my throat. Similarly, all the moves that we make as if we&#x2019;re performing a play somehow unravel across someone else&#x2019;s imagination. It is as if the action and sound on our tiny, remote stage are being broadcast in the thoughts of the Reader. I&#x2019;m not sure that I ever really learned this information&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just something I&#x2019;ve known forever, the same way I know that when I look at the grass and associate it with a color, I know that color is green.<br> <br>I let Rapscullio convince me that he is a nobleman from afar whose beloved daughter has been kidnapped&#x2014;a speech I&#x2019;ve heard so often that occasionally, I murmur the words along with him. In the story, of course, he has no daughter. He&#x2019;s just setting a trap for me. But I&#x2019;m not supposed to know that yet, even though I&#x2019;ve played this scene a thousand times. So while he is going on and on about the other princes who won&#x2019;t rescue Seraphima, I think about the girl who is reading us.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve seen her before. She&#x2019;s different from our usual Readers&#x2014;they&#x2019;re either motherly, like Queen Maureen, or young enough to be captivated by tales of princesses in peril. But this Reader looks&#x2014;well, she looks to be about my age. It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. Surely she knows&#x2014;like I do&#x2014;that fairy tales are just stories. That happy endings aren&#x2019;t real.<br> <br>Frump waddles across the polished black-and-white marble floor, his tail wagging vigorously as he skids to a halt beside me.<br> <br>Suddenly I hear a voice&#x2014;distant, through a tunnel, but clear enough: &#x201c;Delilah, I told you twice already... we&#x2019;re going to be late!&#x201d;<br> <br>From time to time, I&#x2019;ve heard Readers talking. They don&#x2019;t usually read out loud, but every now and then, a conversation occurs when a book is open. I&#x2019;ve learned quite a lot from being a good listener. Like, for example, Don&#x2019;t let the bedbugs bite is apparently a common way to say good night, even in rooms that do not appear to be infested with insects. I&#x2019;ve learned about things the Otherworld has that we don&#x2019;t: television (which is something parents do not like as much as books); Happy Meals (apparently not all meals bring joy. Just the ones that come in a paper bag with a small toy); and showers (something you take before bedtime that leaves you drenched).<br> <br>&#x201c;Just let me finish,&#x201d; the girl says.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve read that book a thousand times&#x2014;you know how it ends. Now means now!&#x201d;<br> <br>I have heard this Reader speaking to the older woman before. From their conversations, I&#x2019;m guessing it&#x2019;s her mother. She is always telling Delilah to put the book away and go outside. To take a walk and get some fresh air. To call a friend (though how many could be within earshot?) and go to a movie (whatever that is). Repeatedly, I wait for her to heed her mother&#x2019;s directions&#x2014;but most of the time she finds an excuse to keep reading. Sometimes she does go outside, but opens the book and starts reading again. I cannot tell you how frustrating this is for me. Here I am, wasting away inside a book I wish I could escape, and all she wants to do is stay in the story.<br> <br>If I could talk to this girl Delilah, I&#x2019;d ask her why on earth she would ever trade a single second of the world she&#x2019;s in for the one in which I&#x2019;m stuck.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;ve tried talking out loud to other Readers. Believe me, it was the very first thing I attempted when I started to actively dream about life in the Otherworld. If I could just get one of those people holding the book to notice me, maybe I&#x2019;d have a chance at escaping. However, the people holding the book see me only when the story is playing, and when the story is playing, I am compelled to stick to the script. Even when I try to say something like &#x201c;Please! Listen to me!&#x201d; I wind up announcing, instead, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to rescue a princess!&#x201d; like some sort of puppet.

Drawing on a rich range of sources, from inventories and guild regulations to poetry and chronicles, it examines everything from panel paintings to carved altarpieces. <br> <br> While many little-known works are foregrounded, Susie Nash also presents new ways of viewing and understanding the more familiar, such as the paintings of Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Hans Memling, by considering the social and economic context of their creation and reception. Throughout, Nash challenges the perception that Italy was the European leader in artistic innovation at this time, demonstrating forcefully that Northern art, and particularly that of the Southern Netherlands, dominated visual culture throughout Europe in this crucial period.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susie Nash</strong> is senior lecturer in Northern Renaissance Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.

And yet in many ways, these daring men remain little known to us. Like most other poor working people of the past, they left few first-hand accounts of their lives. But their lives are not beyond recovery. In this book, Marcus Rediker uses a huge array of historical sources (court records, diaries, travel accounts, and many others) to reconstruct the social cultural world of the Anglo-American seamen and pirates who sailed the seas in the first half of the eighteenth century. Rediker tours the sailor&#39;s North Atlantic, following seamen and their ships along the pulsing routes of trade and into rowdy port towns. He recreates life along the waterfront, where seafaring men from around the world crowded into the sailortown and its brothels, alehouses, street brawls, and city jail. His study explores the natural terror that inevitably shaped the existence of those who plied the forbidding oceans of the globe in small, brittle wooden vessels. It also treats the man-made terror--the harsh discipline, brutal floggings, and grisly hangings--that was a central fact of life at sea. Rediker surveys the commonplaces of the maritime world: the monotonous rounds of daily labor, the negotiations of wage contracts, and the bawdy singing, dancing, and tale telling that were a part of every voyage. He also analyzes the dramatic moments of the sailor&#39;s existence, as Jack Tar battled wind and water during a slashing storm, as he stood by his &#34;brother tars&#34; in a mutiny or a stike, and as he risked his neck by joining a band of outlaws beneath the Jolly Roger, the notorious pirate flag. Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea focuses upon the seaman&#39;s experience in order to illuminate larger historical issues such as the rise of capitalism, the genesis the free wage labor, and the growth</p><p>This unsparing account of the eighteenth-century maritime world reconstructs the often brutal social and cultural milieu of Anglo-American seafaring and piracy, following sailors and their ships from their trade routes into rowdy waterfront ports."...an excellent up-from-the-lower deck study of deepwater sailors in the eighteenth century...the best working-class history I've read in years."

To her work can be attributed the contemporary understanding of the occult origins of much of Western scientific thinking, indeed of Western civilization itself. <em>The Occult Philosophy of the Elizabethan Age</em> was her last book, and in it she condensed many aspects of her wide learning to present a clear, penetrating, and, above all, accessible survey of the occult movements of the Renaissance, highlighting the work of John Dee, Giordano Bruno, and other key esoteric figures. The book is invaluable in illuminating the relationship between occultism and Renaissance thought, which in turn had a profound impact on the rise of science in the seventeenth century. Stunningly written and highly engaging, Yates' masterpiece is a must-read for anyone interested in the occult tradition.</p><p>Dame Francis Yates (1899-1981) was Reader in the History of the Renaissance at the Warburg Institute, University of London. The leading Renaissance scholar of her time, she was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1977 in recognition of her services to Renaissance studies. Her other publications include <em>The Art of Memory</em> and <em>The Rosicrucian Enlightenment</em>.<strong>'Among those who have explored the intellectual world of the sixteenth century, no one can rival Frances Yates.

Tulku Thondup wrote this guide to help us heal our fear and confusion about death and strengthen our practice in anticipation of this transition, and to help us realize the enlightened goal of ultimate peace and joy&#x2014;not only for death and rebirth, but for this very lifetime. In simple language, he distills a vast range of sources, including scriptures, classic commentaries, oral teachings, and firsthand accounts.</p><p>Tulku Thondup Rinpoche, an esteemed author and teacher, was born in East Tibet and studied at the famed Dodrupchen Monastery. In 1958 he settled in India, where he taught at Indian universities for many years. He came to the United States in 1980 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University. For the past two decades he has lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, engaging in translation and writing on Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Nyingma teachings, under the auspices of the Buddhayana Foundation. Among his books are <i>The Healing Power of Mind, </i>which has been published in seventeen languages, and <i>Boundless Healing, </i> in twelve languages.Hoping to "help us realize... ultimate peace and joy... for death and beyond," Thondup, a Tibetan-born teacher, translator and former visiting scholar at Harvard, offers a remarkably lucid distillation of Tibetan Buddhist teachings on how the state of our minds in life affects the nature and quality of our experiences in death. Thondup opens the book with a discussion of some fundamental Buddhist concepts such as impermanence, karma and the importance of meditation for altering our mental habits. He then deconstructs the actual experience of dying (the "crucial hour of life"), a process of distinct stages, including glimpsing the "true nature of the mind" and dwelling in the <i>bardo</i>, a transitional period before rebirth. He even includes lengthy reports of death experiences by delogs, devout Tibetan Buddhists resurrected from the dead for the purpose of explaining how to negotiate the <i>bardo</i>. Thondup rounds out the book with discussions of reincarnation and the importance of&#x2014;and practical instructions for&#x2014;performing rituals for the dead. While the teachings can become sophisticated, Thondup's great strength is his consistent focus on a thesis equally accessible to novices: how we train our minds in life will profoundly influence our "afterdeath" experiences. The result is a provocative and surprisingly compelling work that will appeal to beginners and advanced practitioners alike. <i>(May 24)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He grew up in Pennsylvania with two sisters (one of whom, Tana Hoban, became a noted photographer and children&#x2019;s book author) and attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art, where he met his future wife and collaborator Lillian Aberman. Hoban worked as a commercial artist and advertising copywriter before embarking on a career as a children&#x2019;s author while in his early thirties. Soon the Hobans were collaborating on books, Russell writing the text and Lillian drawing the pictures. During the 1960s the couple worked at a prodigious rate, producing as many as six books in a single year&#x2014;many inspired by life with their own four children&#x2014;including six stories about Frances the badger, <i>The Little Brute Family, Emmet Otter&#x2019;s Jug-Band Christmas</i>, and <i>The Mouse and His Child.</i> Russell Hoban&#x2019;s other books for young readers include <i>The Marzipan Pig, Trouble on Thunder Mountain</i>, and two books about Captain Najork (illustrated by Quentin Blake).

Has the Gospel replaced the Law? What is the relevance of the Old Testament Law to our lives as Christians? Is there continuity between it and what Christ expects of us in the Gospel? It is no secret that Christians have differed widely on these questions. This book explores five major approaches to this important biblical topic that have developed in Protestant circles. Each of the five authors presents his particular perspective on the issue and responds to the other four.

Yet in this case, Gwyneth Paltrow narrates with a confidence and clarity that let the auditory clues and trademark animal collages take center stage.

The Nag Hammadi Library consists of writings found by two peasants who unearthed clay jars in 1945 in upper Egypt. These did not appear in English for 32 years, because the right to publish was contended by scholars, politicians, and antique dealers. <i>The Dead Sea Scrolls</i>, discovered in clay jars in Palestine by a goat herder in 1947, weathered similar storms. The first team of analysts were mostly Christian clergy, who weren't anxious to share material that frightened church leaders. As Dr. Hoeller shows, they rightly feared the documents would reveal information that might detract from unique claims of Christianity. Indeed, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi Library both contradict and complement accepted tenets of the Old and New Testaments.</p><p>As to the connection with Jung, Dr. Hoeller states, "Jung knew that the one and only tradition associated with Christianity that regarded the human psyche as the container of the divine-human encounter was that of the Gnostics of the the first three centuries of our era. For this reason he called for a renewed appreciation of this ancient tradition, and particularly for a return to the Gnostic sense of God as an inner directing and transforming presence." Dr. Hoeller goes on in his preface, "His sympathetic insight into the myths, symbols, and metaphors of the Gnostics, whom by his own admission he regarded as long-lost friends, continues as the brightest beacon of our day..."</p><p>Chapters include such topics as Saintly Rebels: The People of the Scrolls, The Dancing Savior: The Myth of the Gnostic Christ and The Secret Sayings of Jesus: The Gospel of Thomas. The book also includes a thorough notes section as well as an index.</p></p><p>Gospels discovered in the the 1940s reveal a pre-Christian Judaism of Gnostic character. The Dead Sea Scrolls essentially are mystical documents. It appears the Scrolls&#39; Essene authors of 130 B.C- 70 A.D., like the Nag Hammadi Gnostic authors of the Apostolic Age, experienced visions of an esoteric nature, and that the Scrolls possess an inner, hidden meaning.<b>Dr. Stephan A.

Drawing on prominent economic, political, and sociological explanations of nonprofit activity, Peter Frumkin focuses on four important functions that have come to define nonprofit organizations. The author clarifies the debate over the underlying rationale for the nonprofit and voluntary sector&#39;s privileged position in America by examining how nonprofits deliver needed services, promote civic engagement, express values and faith, and channel entrepreneurial impulses. He also exposes the difficult policy questions that have emerged as the boundaries between the nonprofit, business, and government sectors have blurred. Focusing on nonprofits&#39; growing dependence on public funding, tendency toward political polarization, often idiosyncratic missions, and increasing commercialism, Peter Frumkin argues that the long-term challenges facing nonprofit organizations will only be solved when they achieve greater balance among their four central functions. By probing foundational thinking as well as emergent ideas, the book is an essential guide for nonprofit novitiates and experts alike who want to understand the issues propelling public debate about the future of their sector. By virtue of its breadth and insight, Frumkin&#39;s book will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in understanding the complex interplay of public purposes and private values that animate nonprofit organizations.</p><p>Peter Frumkin is Professor of Public Affairs at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, and Director of the RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, both at the University of Texas at Austin.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/FRUBEI_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>The School of the Seers: A Practical Guide on How to See in The Unseen Realm</h2><p><p></p><b>Your how-to guide into the spirit realm!</b><p></p> <p>Get ready to enter the world of a seer!

But Kathryn knew there was little chance she would have turned it down. After all, retirement made her antsy, and nothing excited her more than a challenge. What she could not have known when she accepted the job, however, was just how dysfunctional her team was, and how team members would challenge her in ways no one ever had before.<br><br>In <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</i>, Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two bestselling books, <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO</i> and <i>The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive</i>. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.</p><p>Once again using an astutely written fictional tale to unambiguously but painlessly deliver some hard truths about critical business procedures, Patrick Lencioni targets group behavior in the final entry of his trilogy of corporate fables. And like those preceding it, <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</i> is an entertaining, quick read filled with useful information that will prove easy to digest and implement. This time, Lencioni weaves his lessons around the story of a troubled Silicon Valley firm and its unexpected choice for a new CEO: an old-school manager who had retired from a traditional manufacturing company two years earlier at age 55. Showing exactly how existing personnel failed to function as a unit, and precisely how the new boss worked to reestablish that essential conduct, the book's first part colorfully illustrates the ways that teamwork can elude even the most dedicated individuals--and be restored by an insightful leader. A second part offers details on Lencioni's "five dysfunctions" (absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results), along with a questionnaire for readers to use in evaluating their own teams and specifics to help them understand and overcome these common shortcomings. Like the author's previous books, <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO</i> and <i>Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive</i>, this is highly recommended. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"As compelling, readable and practical as his other books. I'm sure this will be another business classic." (Richard Carr, President &amp; CEO, TEC International) <p> "Every manager and executive will recognize themselves somewhere in this book. Lencioni distills the problems that keep even the most talented teams from realizing their full potential. Even more important, he shows -- in prose that is crisp, clear, and fun to read -- how to solve them." (Geoffrey A. Moore, Chairman, The Chasm Group, Author, <i>Crossing the Chasm; Inside the Tornado; Living on the Fault Line</i>) </p><p> "I read most best-selling business books. What sets Lencioni apart is his ability to provide insightful and practical solutions to complex management challenges." (Phillip Hildebrand, Executive VP and Chief Distribution Officer, New York Life Insurance Company) </p><p> "A gripping analysis of what makes teams work effectively. This fine work is a must read for any leader that has come to grips with the fact that no one makes progress &#x2014; much less succeeds - alone."

A scholar and a fan, Perry considers the art, politics, and culture of hip hop through an analysis of song lyrics, the words of the prophets of the hood. Recognizing prevailing characterizations of hip hop as a transnational musical form, Perry advances a powerful argument that hip hop is first and foremost black American music. At the same time, she contends that many studies have shortchanged the aesthetic value of rap by attributing its form and content primarily to socioeconomic factors. Her innovative analysis revels in the artistry of hip hop, revealing it as an art of innovation, not deprivation.<p></p><p>Perry offers detailed readings of the lyrics of many hip hop artists, including Ice Cube, Public Enemy, De La Soul, krs-One, OutKast, Sean &#x201c;Puffy&#x201d; Combs, Tupac Shakur, Lil&#x2019; Kim, Biggie Smalls, Nas, Method Man, and Lauryn Hill. She focuses on the cultural foundations of the music and on the form and narrative features of the songs&#x2014;the call and response, the reliance on the break, the use of metaphor, and the recurring figures of the trickster and the outlaw. Perry also provides complex considerations of hip hop&#x2019;s association with crime, violence, and misogyny. She shows that while its message may be disconcerting, rap often expresses brilliant insights about existence in a society mired in difficult racial and gender politics. Hip hop, she suggests, airs a much wider, more troubling range of black experience than was projected during the civil rights era. It provides a unique public space where the sacred and the profane impulses within African American culture unite.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Prophets of the Hood&#34; is the most comprehensive and intellectually original study to date of hip hop as a complex and innovative literary narrative form. Written with a refreshing blend of savvy critical rigor and brave and imaginative narrative verve, Imani Perry&#39;s study is an impressive analysis of late-twentieth-century American popular culture.&#34;--Daphne A. Brooks, Princeton University<p>Imani Perry is a Professor in the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University.</p></p><h2>Logic &amp; Faith: Discerning truth in logical arguments</h2><p>We all have questions.

When it finally lands deep in the underground tunnels, dozens of little dogs are gazing at it with trepidation. The biggest prairie dog of all, the bully Big Bark, comes to take a look, but before he can get close enough, Pip Squeak runs up to the ball and exclaims, � It's fuzzy!' � Oooooooh!' gasped the other dogs. Soon, they all begin adorning themselves with pieces of lime-green fuzz, ignoring Big Bark's commands that they stop this foolishness. Prairie dogs come from all over to help themselves until the ball is plucked bare. War breaks out, leaving Pip Squeak feeling rather guilty for starting it all. While the embattled dogs collapse in exhaustion, Big Bark steals all of the fuzz, proclaiming himself king of the fuzz, which makes him an easy target for an eagle, who swoops down and grabs him. Pip Squeak rallies the others to come to Big Bark's aid. The marvelously rendered mixed-media illustrations, with vivid blues, earthy browns, and that luminescent green, capture the true fuzzy nature and greenish glow of the ball. As in the author's popular <i>Tops and Bottoms</i> (Harcourt, 1995), this book employs both horizontal and vertical spreads, effectively taking readers deep into the underground realm.

This must change to ensure a capitalism that works for us all.<br><br><i>Shortlisted for the FT &amp; McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award</i><br></b><br>A scathing indictment of our current global financial system, <i>The Value of Everything</i> rigorously scrutinizes the way in which economic value has been accounted and reveals how economic theory has failed to clearly delineate the difference between value creation and value extraction. Mariana Mazzucato argues that the increasingly blurry distinction between the two categories has allowed certain actors in the economy to portray themselves as value creators, while in reality they are just moving around existing value or, even worse, destroying it. <br><br>The book uses case studies-from Silicon Valley to the financial sector to big pharma-to show how the foggy notions of value create confusion between rents and profits, reward extractors and creators, and distort the measurements of growth and GDP. In the process, innovation suffers and inequality rises. <br><br>The lesson here is urgent and sobering: to rescue our economy from the next inevitable crisis and to foster long-term economic growth, we will need to rethink capitalism, rethink the role of public policy and the importance of the public sector, and redefine how we measure value in our society.<br></p><p><b>Mariana Mazzucato</b> is professor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London (UCL), where she directs the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose. She is the winner of the 2014 New Statesman SPERI Prize for Political Economy, the 2015 Hans-Matth�fer-Preis, and the 2018 Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. She was named as one of the "three most important thinkers about innovation" by the <i>New Republic</i>.

And, furthermore, how the conventional wisdom has indulged them in this." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b>Fran Boait for <i>Prospect</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Mazzucato's] passionate call to empower policymakers to understand that the state's role is not secondary to the private sector is infectious."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i><i>PROSPECT</i></i></b></i></b><br><br>"Mazzucato is fast emerging as one of the world's leading public intellectuals... [she] has offered the left a positive vision of growth based on innovation and profit-sharing, rather than sterile and counter-productive analysis based on the politics of resentment and expropriation."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i><i>SPECTATOR</i></i></b></i></b><br><br>"Mazzucato sides with the actual makers, those who struggle in an economy tilted in favor of the ultrawealthy... she expresses specific incredulity about the banking sector's self-serving statements about wealth creation...

That world is inhabited by a unique assortment of eccentric craftsmen and passionate enthusiasts who have created some of the world's most beloved musical instruments, feared weapons, dazzling architecture, sacred relics, and bizarre forms of transportation. In <em>A Splintered History of Wood</em>, Spike Carlsen has uncovered the most outlandish characters and examples, from world-champion chainsaw carvers to blind woodworkers, the Miraculous Staircase to the Lindbergh kidnapping case, and many more, in a passionate and personal exploration of nature's greatest gift.</p><p>SPIKE CARLSEN is an editor, carpenter, woodworker, and author of the award-winning A&nbsp;,&nbsp;which was featured as&nbsp;an NPR &#x201c;Best Books of 2008&#x201d; and 2008 MBA Midwest Connections Pick.&nbsp;A former executive editor of&nbsp;&nbsp;magazine, he has written for&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and many other publications.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Sounds of Language: An Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology</h2><p><p><i>The Sounds of Language</i> is an introductory guide to the linguistic study of speech sounds, which provides uniquely balanced coverage of both phonology and phonetics.</p> <ul> <li>Features exercises and problem sets, as well as supporting online resources at www.wiley.com/go/zsiga, including additional discussion questions and exercises, as well as links to further resources such as sound files, video files, and useful websites</li> <li>Creates opportunities for students to practice data analysis and hypothesis testing</li> <li>Integrates data on sociolinguistic variation, first language acquisition, and second language learning</li> <li>Explores diverse topics ranging from the practical, such as how to make good digital recordings, make a palatogram, solve a phoneme/allophone problem, or read a spectrogram; to the theoretical, including the role of markedness in linguistic theory, the necessity of abstraction, features and formal notation, issues in speech perception as distinct from hearing, and modelling sociolinguistic and other variations</li> <li>Organized specifically to fit the needs of undergraduate students of phonetics and phonology, and is structured in a way which enables instructors to use the text both for a single semester phonetics and phonology course or for a two-course sequence</li> </ul></p><p><p><i>The Sounds of Language</i> is an introductory guide to the linguistic study of speech sounds, giving equal weight to both phonology and phonetics.

Exploring the play's qualities as a complex work of art written specifically for the theater, the introduction to this new edition sets the play in its historical context, discussing the originality of Shakespeare's treatment of a well-known story.

Serving an enviably affluent, diverse, and liberal district, the school is well-funded, its teachers are well-trained, and many of its students are high achieving. Yet Riverview has not escaped the same unrelenting question that plagues schools throughout America: why is it that even when all of the circumstances seem right, black and Latino students continue to lag behind their peers? <br><br>Through five years' worth of interviews and data-gathering at Riverview, John Diamond and Amanda Lewis have created a rich and disturbing portrait of the achievement gap that persists more than fifty years after the formal dismantling of segregation. As students progress from elementary school to middle school to high school, their level of academic achievement increasingly tracks along racial lines, with white and Asian students maintaining higher GPAs and standardized testing scores, taking more advanced classes, and attaining better college admission results than their black and Latino counterparts. Most research to date has focused on the role of poverty, family stability, and other external influences in explaining poor performance at school, especially in urban contexts. Diamond and Lewis instead situate their research in a suburban school, and look at what factors within the school itself could be causing the disparity. Most crucially, they challenge many common explanations of the 'racial achievement gap,' exploring what race actually means in this situation, and why it matters.<br><br>An in-depth study with far-reaching consequences, <em>Despite the Best Intentions</em> revolutionizes our understanding of both the knotty problem of academic disparities and the larger question of the color line in American society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Amanda Lewis</strong> studies racial dynamics in the contemporary US. Her research focuses on how race shapes educational opportunities and on how our ideas about race get negotiated in everyday life. She is the author of the award-winning Race in the Schoolyard: Negotiating the color-line in classrooms and communities along with several other volumes. She is on the faculty in the Departments of Sociology and African American Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br><br><strong>John Diamond</strong> is a sociologist of education who focuses on how race, ethnicity, and social class intersect with school leadership, practices, and policies to shape educational opportunities and outcomes. He is the Hoefs-Bascom Professor of Education at University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Education. Previously, he was an associate professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and past research director for a consortium of U.S. schools that used research to address racial achievement disparities.<br><br>"Lewis and Diamond persuasively explain the gross misalignment between abstract values and unequal outcomes. In a racially diverse school like Riverview, parents, teachers, and students can value diversity and equality in principle, but they can also behave in ways that exacerbate and reproduce class and racial hierarchies, resulting in an achievement gap that will not disappear with raceneutral policies." - Jennifer Lee, Columbia University, American Journal of Sociology <br><p></p><br></p><h2>First Aid For the USMLE Step 1 2020, Thirtieth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><strong></strong><b></b><p><b><br>EXCEL ON THE USMLE� STEP 1 WITH HELP FROM THE WORLD&#x2019;S MOST POPULAR MEDICAL REVIEW BOOK!</b><b><br></b><b>Trust First Aid&#x2122; to help you score your highest on this high-stakes exam</b><br><br>Written by students who excelled on the Step 1 exam and reviewed by top faculty for accuracy, this indispensable guide provides you with a blueprint of all the content you&#x2019;re likely to find on the exam.

Today, bunches of fresh oregano and rosemary can be found in nearly every supermarket, basil and mint grow abundantly in backyards from coast to coast, and garden centers offer pots of edible geraniums and lemon thyme. But once these herbs reach the kitchen, the inevitable question arises: Now what do I do with them? Here, at last, is the first truly comprehensive cookbook to cover all aspects of growing, handling, and cooking with fresh herbs.</b><br><br>Jerry Traunfeld grew up cooking and gardening in Maryland, but it wasn't until the 1980s, after he had graduated from the California Culinary Academy and was working at Jeremiah Tower's Stars restaurant in San Francisco, that he began testing the amazing potential of herb cuisine. For the past decade, Jerry Traunfeld has been chef at The Herbfarm, an enchanted restaurant surrounded by kitchen gardens and tucked into the rainy foothills of the Cascade Mountains, east of Seattle. His brilliant nine-course herb-inspired menus have made reservations at the Herbfarm among the most coveted in the country.<br> <br>Eager to reveal his magic to home cooks, Jerry Traunfeld shares 200 of his best recipes in <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook.</i> Written with passion, humor, and a caring for detail that makes this book quite special, <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> explains everything from how to recognize the herbs in your supermarket to how to infuse a jar of honey with the flavor of fresh lavender. Recipes include a full range of dishes from soups, salads, eggs, pasta and risotto, vegetables, poultry, fish, meats, breads, and desserts to sauces, ice creams, sorbets, chutneys, vinegars, and candied flowers. On the familiar side are recipes for Bay Laurel Roasted Chicken and Roasted Asparagus Salad with Fried Sage explained with the type of detail that insures the chicken will be moist and suffused with the flavor of bay and the asparagus complemented with the delicate crunch of sage. On the novel side you will find such unusual dishes as Oysters on the Half Shell with Lemon Varbana Ice and Rhubarb and Angelica Pie.<br> <br>A treasure trove of information, <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> contains a glossary of 27 of the most common culinary herbs and edible flowers; a definitive guide to growing herbs in a garden, a city lot, or on a windowsill; a listing of the USDA has hardiness zones; how to harvest, clean, and store fresh herbs; a Growing Requirements Chart, including each herb's life cycle, height, pruning and growing needs, and number of plants to grow for an average kitchen; and a Cooking with Fresh Herbs Chart, with parts of the herb used, flavor characteristics, amount of chopped herb for six servings, and best herbal partners.<br> <br><i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i> is the most complete, inspired, and useful book about cooking with herbs ever written.<br> <br>-8 pages of finished dishes in full color<br> <br>-16 full-page botanical watercolors in full color</p><p>Since 1990, Jerry Traunfeld has been the chef at the Herbfarm, a restaurant-nursery nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State devoted to propagating an exceptional variety of culinary herbs, edible flowers, and greens. People wait months for a table at this restaurant, where Traunfeld's unaffected yet sophisticated cooking unfolds in a nine-course dinner. Reading his recipes, you understand why. It is hard to get through even the first chapter, on soups, without starting a shopping list for making Green Gazpacho, a cooling blend of cucumbers and green pepper with spearmint, parsley, and cilantro, or Herbal Chicken Noodle Soup, lavish with fresh basil, chives, tarragon, and marjoram.<p> After enticing you with the story of his signature dish, a green salad made with up to 30 ingredients, each literally harvested and assembled on the plate one leaf and blossom at a time, Traunfeld shows how, using more typical resources, you can construct a salad friends will declare a delicious work of art. To make it really simple, he provides a chart listing 50 possible choices that helps you balance the flavors, including hot, sweet, bitter, and aromatic, and the colors and textures that make a salad more than a plate of lovely greens. </p><p> However, if you don't live in a culinary paradise like the Seattle area, only have access to a typical supermarket, and you don't want to grow your own herbs, you can still infuse your cooking with the same enticing magic Traunfeld creates at the Herbfarm. Just tuck sprigs of thyme, rosemary, or oregano between the slices of a loaf of country bread spread with butter or olive oil and roasted garlic, wrap it in foil, and pop it in the oven for a quick 12 minutes. Or try Mashed Potatoes with Toasted Coriander, the seeds adding earthy flavor to a perennial favorite, and serve with chicken piccata enlivened with fresh dill.</p><p> Traunfeld is such a good teacher and clear writer that you follow with confidence when he guides you through Herb-Smoked Salmon--first dry-rubbed, then smoked over dried stems from basil, thyme, or fennel and finally baked until the fish is just gently set. You also get an introduction to the Japanese concept of <i>umami</i>, a state of food perfection that Traunfeld achieves in his Umami Carrot Soup with Mint. </p><p> Following the 200 recipes and alluring photos of some prepared dishes, you learn about growing herbs, both in the garden and in containers. A section describing herbs and edible flowers, from angelica to violets, is ample and articulate enough to stand on its own as a book, and those interested in gardening will appreciate the list of nurseries here. Finally, this section includes a table covering 29 herbs that will help you transform your own favorite dishes simply by adding fresh herbs. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><b>What other chefs have said about <i>The Herbfarm Cookbook</i></b> <p>"The Herbfarm Cookbook belongs on your bookshelf.

When Fergus is put in charge of a recycling center and dubbed the "environment officer," Constable Hamish Macbeth smells trouble. Sure enough, Fergus soon becomes a bullying tyrant with his new power. And after his body is found stuffed in a recycling bin, no one's sorry-including his long-suffering family. But Macbeth is surprised to find that many of the despicable dustman's victims refuse to talk. And when violence strikes again, the lanky lawman must quickly unearth the culprit among a litter of suspects . . . before a killer makes a clean getaway.</p><p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series. Beaton is also the author of the bestselling Agatha Raisin series, which will air as an eight-episode dramatic series on Sky1, starring Ashley Jensen. She lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.That the prolific Beaton seems to be writing for television in her 16th Hamish Macbeth mystery (after Death of an Addict) may be no surprise, given that the same U.K. company that brought Inspector Morse to the small screen has filmed some novels in this series. After all, what's superficial or formulaic on the page can look just fine on TV. When, in an effort to gain publicity for the local community and herself, bullying Strathbane Council member Freda Fleming gets drunken Lochdubh dustman Fergus Macleod promoted to "environmental officer," Fergus can't believe his luck. Alas, he doesn't have much time to strut his new military-style uniform ("He looked for all the world like the wizened dictator of some totalitarian regime"), because someone bashes the back of his head in and dumps his body in a rubbish bin. Enter policeman Hamish Macbeth, who soon discovers that Fergus had a second career as a blackmailer. As he pursues various suspects and red herrings, Hamish flirts with an old girlfriend, muses on the horrors of wife-beating, and generally carries on in a way that presumes readers are old friends who'll forgive him his every indulgence. A wildly improbable feat of Scottish hammer-throwing brings down the villain, while a second murder that's not what it seems provides some last-minute suspense. If the U.K. television series ever comes to the U.S., that would give sales a big boost. Mystery Guild Featured Alternate.

The authors use clear examples, lucid language, and engaging activities to involve students in thinking through fundamental ideas that ground their understanding of diversity. This is an innovative approach to teaching diversity that challenges students' misconceptions, perceptions, and assumptions with interactive exercises and discussion exercises. In reading and engaging in controversial issues, students are challenged to think about implications from research and to draw conclusions on their own, rather than feeling like they are being subjected to opinions to which they must agree because of " political correctness." <p> The content is grounded in interdisciplinary studies from behavioral and social sciences including psychology, sociology, education, biology, history, and anthropology. Each chapter is presented in an inquiry format, consisting of questions within the narrative followed by discussion activities and exercises that relate to the topics and issues raised. There are a variety of activities so instructors can select which ones they think will be most effective with their students. </p><p> "" Written with wisdom, clarity, compassion, and a deep moral commitment to building multicultural democracy.

With Lavoisier's discoveries of the compositions of air and water (he gave the world the term 'oxygen') and his analysis of the process of combustion, he was able to bury once and for all the then prevalent phlogiston doctrine. He also recognized chemical elements as the ultimate residues of chemical analysis and, with others, worked out the beginnings of the modern system of nomenclature. His premature death at the hands of a Revolutionary tribunal is undoubtedly one of the saddest losses in the history of science.<br>Lavoisier's theories were promulgated widely by a work he published in 1789: <i>Trait� �l�mentaire</i><i>de Chimie</i>. The famous English translation by Robert Kerr was issued a year later. Incorporating the notions of the "new chemistry," the book carefully describes the experiments and reasoning which led Lavoisier to his conclusions, conclusions which were generally accepted by the scientific community almost immediately. It is not too much to claim that Lavoisier's Trait� did for chemistry what Newton's Principia did for physics, and that Lavoisier founded modern chemistry.<br>Part One of the <i>Trait�</i> covers the composition of the atmosphere and water, and related experiments, one of which (on vinous fermentation) permits Lavoisier to make the first explicit statement of the law of the conservation of matter in chemical change. The second part deals with the compounds of acids with various bases, giving extensive tables of compounds. Its most significant item, however, is the table of simple substances or elements &#x2014; the first modern list of the chemical elements. The third section of the book reviews in minute detail the apparatus and instruments of chemistry and their uses. Some of these instruments, etc. are illustrated in the section of plates at the end.<br>This new facsimile edition is enhanced by an introductory essay by Douglas McKie, University College London, one of the world's most eminent historians of science. Prof. McKie gives an excellent survey of historical developments in chemistry leading up to the <i>Trait�</i>, Lavoisier's major contributions, his work in other fields, and offers a critical evaluation of the importance of this book and Lavoisier's role in the history of chemistry. This new essay helps to make this an authoritative, contemporary English-language edition of one of the supreme classics of science.</p><p></p><h2>The Qur&#39;an: A Translation</h2><p>This English translation of the Qur&#39;an is a compilation of the Muslim faith&#39;s Final Revelation from God to mankind through the last Prophet Muhammad, Peace be upon Him. The Qur&#39;an has a wealth of information--both worldly wisdom and intellectual concepts--providing a code of life for humankind generally and Muslims in particular. Indeed, the Qur&#39;an&#39;s miracle lies in its ability to offer something to non-believers and everything to believers.

Consequences have followed which no one anticipated, and which the preacher attributes to the sovereign hand of God. A people united to Christ, and to their pastor, became a channel for blessing across the earth. It has been a ministry marked by characteristics that re-appear in every spiritual advance - not concern for relevance not special attractions for young or old, male or female; but love for God and dependence on his Word and promises. MacArthur has proved, without ever intending to do so, that true preaching of the Word of God is international, because if you teach the Bible it transcends every border, every language, every culture. It is as relevant today, and will be tomorrow, as in all the years since God put it down. That is why his sermons are heard or read in more than two hundred countries around the world today.<br>But this is also a human story, including the shaping of his youth, the strength of marriage and family, the refining influence of trials and controversies, and the building of a man whose staff have never known to be angry. There are friends who, for all their love of his ministry, say his life is his best sermon.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete History of Middle-earth</h2><p>This special collector&#39;s edition features all 12 parts of the series bound in three volumes. Each book includes a silk ribbon marker and is quarter-bound in black, with grey boards stamped in gold foil, and the set is presented in a matching black slipcase. J.R.R. Tolkien is famous the world over for his unique literary creation, exemplified in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. What is less well known, however, is that he also produced a vast amount of further material that greatly expands upon the mythology and numerous stories of Middle-earth, and which gives added life to the thousand-year war between the Elves and the evil spirit Morgoth, and his terrifying lieutenant, Sauron. It was to this enormous task of literary construction that his Tolkien&#39;s youngest son and literary heir, Christopher, applied himself to produce the monumental and endlessly fascinating series of twelve books, The History of Middle-earth. This very special collector&#39;s edition brings together all twelve books into three hardback volumes - over 5,000 pages of fascinating Tolkien material - and places them in one matching box.</p><p>Christopher Tolkien, born on 21 November 1924, is the third son of J.R.R. Tolkien. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm as a pilot. At the end of the war he returned to Oxford University, and became a fellow of New College and tutor in English in 1964, lecturing in the University on early English and northern literature. Appointed by J.R.R. Tolkien to be his literary executor, he has devoted himself since his father&#39;s death in 1973 to the editing and publication of unpublished writings, notably The Silmarillion and the collections entitled Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth. Since 1975 he has live in France with his wife Baillie.`One marvels anew at the depth, breadth and persistence of J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s labour. No one sympathetic to his aims - the invention of a secondary universe - will want to miss this chance to be present at the creation.&#39; Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Chaos Choreography (InCryptid)</h2><p><b>The fifth book in&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling Seanan McGuire's witty urban fantasy InCryptid series about a family of cryptozoologists who act as a buffer between humans and the magical creatures living in secret around us.<br></b><br>"The only thing more fun than an October Daye book is an InCryptid book." &#x2014;<b>Charlaine Harris</b>, #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of Sookie Stackhouse series<br><br><b>Destiny, Noun: <br></b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.

Every time I swept my flashlight across the water, I found another two or three dozen pairs glowing in the darkness. All of them were focused on the flashlight, which meant all of them were focused on us. Way to make a girl feel loved.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me for stating the obvious, but we&#x2019;re outnumbered,&#x201d; murmured Dominic. He wasn&#x2019;t holding a flashlight. His hands were empty, for now. If something moved, so would he, and given how many knives he could conceal in his leather duster&#x2014;which may have been cool fifteen years ago; now it was just a weird, if practical, affectation&#x2014;he wouldn&#x2019;t have any trouble fighting it off.<br><br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; I agreed, continuing to play my flashlight across the water. Eyes, eyes, eyes. Everywhere eyes. I ran down the checklist in the back of my head, trying to find something they could belong to that <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> a sudden and inexplicable infestation of swamp hags. Swamp hags don&#x2019;t belong in city reservoirs. Adults don&#x2019;t move between territories very often, and the size of the eyes I was seeing implied an infestation of adolescents. Which made no sense at all. They would&#x2019;ve had to be carried here, and who the hell thought <i>that</i> was a good idea? Why&#x2014;<br><br>A bullfrog&#x2019;s sonorous croak split the air. I blinked twice before I burst out laughing, earning myself a sidelong look from Dominic.<br><br>&#x201c;What is so funny?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here because Artie heard a rumor about &#x2018;something weird at the reservoir,&#x2019; right?&#x201d; A nod. &#x201c;And we both assumed the eyes were the weird thing, hence your comment about us being outnumbered.&#x201d; Another nod. I grinned. &#x201c;The only thing that&#x2019;s wrong here is how many frogs are swimming in the drinking water. Somebody should probably tell the city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Frogs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup. Frogs.&#x201d; I picked up a rock and lobbed it toward a cluster of eyes. The cluster scattered. Several plump bullfrog bodies were briefly visible in the flashlight beam. The rest of the eyes didn&#x2019;t budge. I lowered my flashlight. &#x201c;They get hypnotized by the light&#x2014;hence the staring. They&#x2019;re an invasive species, but they&#x2019;re not our problem.&#x201d;<br><br>Something splashed a little farther out in the reservoir.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Verity,&#x201d; said Dominic.<br><br>&#x201c;People introduced them all over the country, sometimes by mistake, sometimes on purpose, and sometimes because they were trying to feed the family manticore,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Manticore are surprisingly chill about eating amphibians. You&#x2019;d think the whole &#x2018;cold blood&#x2019; thing would be a problem, but you&#x2019;d be wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Verity, I must insist,&#x201d; said Dominic.<br><br>&#x201c;Insist on what?&#x201d; I turned to face him, the beam of my flashlight striking his chest and illuminating his face. He had his serious expression on, the one that implied an asteroid was about to smack into the planet and wipe out all human life, thus sparing him the indignity of putting up with it for one minute more. It used to piss me off when he made that face. These days I find it funny as hell. Nobody fights harder for the survival of the people around him than Dominic, and it&#x2019;s not his fault he sounds like a stuffed shirt half the time.&nbsp;<br><br>He is a man of many excellent qualities, which is why I married him.<br><br>&#x201c;I must insist you look back at the water.&#x201d; He was starting to sound faintly strangled. That wasn&#x2019;t normal. It probably wasn&#x2019;t good. I turned my flashlight back toward the reservoir.<br><br>The light gleamed off the scales of a long, slender column that stretched from the water to some unseen higher point. Mouth suddenly dry, I played the light upward, confirming that a) the column was a neck, and b) the neck belonged to something carnivorous in the long-necked plesiosaur family.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Well. Will you look at that?&#x201d;<br><br>Like the frogs, the plesiosaur seemed fascinated by my light. Unlike the frogs, the plesiosaur had a head at least two feet long, and a mouth that bristled with sharp, flesh-ripping teeth. I&#x2019;d been a lot happier when it was just frogs.<br><br>&#x201c;That is a dinosaur,&#x201d; said Dominic. &#x201c;I . . . I admit, I was not expecting a dinosaur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Technically it&#x2019;s not a dinosaur, it&#x2019;s a plesiosaur,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think. Probably. I don&#x2019;t feel like getting closer so I can find out, do you?&#x201d; Plesiosaurs, and things like them, are the purview of my brother Alex, who likes reptiles and amphibians and other creatures he can&#x2019;t reasonably have a conversation with. Unfortunately, Alex was in Ohio, and had not accompanied us on the night&#x2019;s adventure. I&#x2019;m the urban cryptid girl. My job involves talking to things that can talk <i>back</i>, and as far as I knew, plesiosaurs didn&#x2019;t fall under that umbrella.<br><br>Maybe I was being hasty. I cleared my throat, pasted on my most reasonable-looking smile, and called, &#x201c;Hello, the plesiosaur! Would you like to have a nice chat about what you&#x2019;re doing in our reservoir?&#x201d;<br><br>My name is Verity Price; I&#x2019;m a cryptozoologist. That means that sometimes my life includes shouting at extinct genera of reptiles. My life is weird.<br><br>The plesiosaur cocked its head, looking for all the world like an enormous iguana. For a moment, I thought maybe this was going to work out for the best. The plesiosaur would reveal a heretofore unsuspected intelligence, and explain in small, pleasant words how it had wound up in the Portland reservoir, and how I could get it out before the authorities noticed.<br><br>Then the plesiosaur opened its mouth, made a horrifying keening noise, and darted toward us, moving fast enough to constitute a clear and present danger. I yelped, jumping out of the way. Dominic was a dark blur against the bushes as he raced for safety. The plesiosaur&#x2019;s jaws snapped shut where I&#x2019;d been standing only a moment before.<br><br>&#x201c;Not friendly,&#x201d; I said, in case Dominic had somehow managed to miss the memo.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh <i>really</i>? Whatever gave you that idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for sarcasm,&#x201d; I called. In the distance, Dominic snorted.<br><br>The plesiosaur pulled back for another strike. I braced myself to jump again. The thing couldn&#x2019;t stay in the reservoir, that was for sure, and I didn&#x2019;t want to leave when there was a chance it might eat a jogger or something, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to kill it, either. There&#x2019;d been no reports of it hurting anyone. There hadn&#x2019;t even been any conclusive sightings, prior to me and my flashlight. It was just an innocent prehistoric reptile, doing what came naturally for innocent prehistoric reptiles.<br><br>The head snapped forward again. I jumped backward this time, using my momentum to turn the motion into a handspring. It was showy and pointless, but a girl&#x2019;s got to stay in practice somehow, and besides, it wasn&#x2019;t like we were in a lot of danger as long as we didn&#x2019;t hold still. The plesiosaur was cranky and snappy, but it couldn&#x2019;t leave the water. Well. I didn&#x2019;t <i>think</i> it could leave the water. It probably couldn&#x2019;t leave the water.<br><br>I decided to stay a little farther back from the water.<br><br>&#x201c;Is there a plan? Or are you just going to keep jumping about like a startled cat?&#x201d; Dominic&#x2019;s voice came from behind me. He must have gotten through the bushes and worked his way around to avoid the plesiosaur.<br><br>&#x201c;Those bushes are like half blackberry bramble,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware,&#x201d; said Dominic.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a plan,&#x201d; I said, tensing as the plesiosaur pulled back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to wear it out, and when it submerges, I&#x2019;m going to find out who thought it was okay to store their giant lizard in the city reservoir, and we&#x2019;re going to have a little talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There will still be a plesiosaur in the reservoir,&#x201d; said Dominic.<br><br>Sometimes he was so practical it made me want to scream. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why God invented U-Haul rentals,&#x201d; Isaid. The plesiosaur lunged. I leaped. From the blackberry bushes, Dominic swore. I allowed myself to smile. He was learning the dangers of questioning me.<br><br>Not that he had much left to learn. Dominic and I met in New York, where I&#x2019;d been spending a year working as a professional ballroom dancer and he was doing the prep work for a purge by the Covenant of St. George. Naturally, we hit it off right away. He hit me with a snare, and then I hit him with my stunning wit and cheerful willingness to shoot him until he stopped squirming. It wasn&#x2019;t your classic Hollywood meet-cute&#x2014;more of a standoff with the cryptid population of Manhattan hanging in the balance&#x2014;but we&#x2019;d been able to make things work. Mostly because he was a nice guy, under all that Covenant brainwashing, and he had the common sense to find me mad cute, which meant he was also a <i>smart </i>guy.<br><br>&#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re not planning to put the dinosaur in the back of a U-Haul.&#x201d; There was a pleading note in Dominic&#x2019;s tone, like he couldn&#x2019;t believe those words had left his mouth in that order. &#x201c;The company is still angry with us over the <i>last</i> U-Haul you rented.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am a constant source of enlightenment and delight, and it&#x2019;s a plesiosaur!&#x201d; I chirped, and jumped again.<br><br>Two things happened then: three flashlights clicked on at the edge of the path along the reservoir, and a voice shouted, &#x201c;Hey! What are you doing over there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, great, civilians,&#x201d; I muttered.<br><br>Most people don&#x2019;t believe in monsters. Sure, the general public enjoys a good scare. Somebody makes a movie about a cursed videotape or a haunted doll, and they&#x2019;re right in the front row, shoveling down popcorn and screaming happy screams when somebody&#x2019;s guts hit the floor. That&#x2019;s not the same as believing. Some things we have to hide from science, waiting for the day when people will be ready to deal with the idea of talking mice or fish with fur. Other things science hides from itself, because no one really wants the night to be dark and filled with monsters. That era has passed.<br><br>The trouble is, nobody gave the monsters&#x2014;better described as &#x201c;predatory cryptids,&#x201d; since &#x201c;monster&#x201d; is sort of insulting&#x2014;the memo. They exist, and when given the opportunity, they happily eat people who don&#x2019;t believe in them. This brought me back to the civilians running down the path in our direction, heedless of the fact that at the end of their jog, they were going to be facing a lot of teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;Dominic,&#x201d; I hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on it,&#x201d; he said. The bushes rustled, and he appeared a few yards down the path, running toward the flashlights.<br><br>&#x201c;I married Batman,&#x201d; I said fondly. The plesiosaur struck. I yelped, barely jumping out of the way in time.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop harassing Nemo!&#x201d; wailed an unfamiliar voice.<br><br>The plesiosaur turned toward it, neck stretching into a curve I could only describe as curious. Really tame snakes sometimes assumed that position. So did snakes that were thinking about turning something into a new source of protein. I gave serious, if rapid, thought to launching myself at the plesiosaur. I wasn&#x2019;t wearing anything I couldn&#x2019;t get wet, and it might keep somebody from being eaten.<br><br>Then the words sunk in. &#x201c;Wait. Nemo?&#x201d; I turned to look in the same direction as the plesiosaur. &#x201c;You <i>named</i> it?&#x201d;<br><br>The owners of the flashlights kept running. Dominic grabbed one by the shoulders, hauling the figure to a halt, but the other two got past him, becoming visible. Both were in their early twenties, at best; they might have been in their teens. One was faster than the other. He reached me first, and shoved me hard enough that I actually stumbled. His companion ran for the edge of the reservoir, where the plesiosaur was bowing its head to meet her.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d; he demanded, going in to shove me again.<br><br>Right. I&#x2019;d been startled before, but no way was he putting his hands on me a second time. I grabbed his wrist, spinning hard to the side and twisting as I went, until I wound up behind him with his arm bent at an angle that wasn&#x2019;t<i> quite </i>going to dislocate his shoulder. Well, probably not. If he moved, all bets were off.<br><br>He made a guttural keening noise, surprisingly low for the amount of pain he was almost certainly in. His companion turned from the act of stroking the plesiosaur&#x2019;s nose, her eyes gone wide with shock. He&#x2019;d dropped his flashlight when I grabbed him. It was spinning, illuminating different parts of the scene.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said brightly, giving the girl my best camera-ready smile. &#x201c;Who feels like explaining what the hell is going on? I&#x2019;ll give you a hint: it&#x2019;s probably not your friend here. He&#x2019;s sort of got other things to worry about.&#x201d; I gave his arm another squeeze. He moaned again.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; The girl stepped forward, putting herself between me and the plesiosaur. &#x201c;Let Charlie go! He didn&#x2019;t do anything to you!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh, wrong,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He shoved me. Didn&#x2019;t anybody ever teach him that it&#x2019;s rude to lay hands on a lady?&#x201d;<br><br>Dominic came walking down the path, dragging another young woman by the arm. She had long brown hair, and looked like the sort of girl I was used to finding on my sister&#x2019;s roller derby team. Too bad she <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> on my sister&#x2019;s roller derby team. Antimony would have known about the plesiosaur if that had been the case, and we wouldn&#x2019;t be standing here now.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, we&#x2019;re not hurting anything,&#x201d; said the second girl. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t expect to see your flashlights, and we sort of panicked. Please, let us go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were you expecting to see the plesiosaur?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nemo&#x2019;s not a dino&#x2014;&#x201d; protested the first girl. Then she caught herself, and blinked, and said, &#x201c;Um, yes. He&#x2019;s ours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Maybe I got something in my ear when your friend here shoved me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Did you just say the plesiosaur was <i>yours</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>Dominic released the second girl, who rocked back and forth for a moment, torn between rushing to defend her prehistoric reptile and going to the aid of her much more modern, if not much more evolved, companion. In the end, the plesiosaur won, and she fled to stand next to the other girl, blocking &#x201c;Nemo&#x201d; from our deadly attentions.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; snapped the first girl. &#x201c;Nemo&#x2019;s ours, and he&#x2019;s never hurt anybody, and no one would believe you anyway, so you should just go. You hear me? Get out of here and go.&#x201d;</p><h2>My Life and My Life in the Nineties (Wesleyan Poetry Series)</h2><p>Lyn Hejinian is among the most prominent of contemporary American poets. Her poem My Life has garnered accolades and fans inside and outside academia. First published in 1980, and revised in 1987 and 2002, My Life is now firmly established in the postmodern canon. This Wesleyan edition includes the 45-part prose poem sequence along with a closely related ten-part work titled My Life in the Nineties. An experimental intervention into the autobiographical genre, My Life explores the many ways in which language&#x2015;the things people say and the ways they say them&#x2015;shapes not only their identity, but also the very world around them.</p><p>LYN HEJINIAN is the author of A Border Comedy, and The Book of a Thousand Eyes, among many other books. She has also worked in collaboratively-authored projects, including Sight (with Leslie Scalapino, 1999) and The Wide Road (with Carla Harryman, 2010). She is a professor in the English department at the University of California, Berkeley."One major source of joy in reading My Life comes from the collision of various sentences and subjects. In that very collision&#x2015;vaguely cubist or collagist&#x2015;lies the humor and pleasure of this text, which is a kind of super-collider, a site for high-energy linguistic experimentation."&#x2015;Hank Lazer, <i>Archive Newsletter</i><p>"To read the twenty-first-century iteration of Hejinian's poetic autobiography is to experience anew a poem that conceives of a life as an ever-unfolding process of recapitulations and echoes, expansions and contractions, discontinuities, recontextualizations, and accumulations. It presents life as a whole that is at once more than its constituent parts and yet incomplete and ongoing."&#x2015;Tim Wood, <i>Boston Review</i></p><p>"Hejinian has for some time been noted for her love of rich textual surface effects, but never before has she found a method of construction so suited to its development."&#x2015;Ron Silliman, <i>San Francisco Review of Books</i></p><p>"One major source of joy in reading My Life comes from the collision of various sentences and subjects.

How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters&#x2014;the Googleplex&#x2014;to show how Google works.<br> <br> While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google&#x2019;s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.<br> <br> The key to Google&#x2019;s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers&#x2014;free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses&#x2014;and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.<br> <br> But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups.

Twenty-two people from a company based in Mountain View, California, had driven in SUVs and vans up an unpaved road to this enclave of seventy threadbare huts with cement floors, surrounded by fields occasionally trampled by unwelcome elephants. Though electricity had come to Ragihalli some years earlier, there was not a single personal computer in the community. The visit had begun awkwardly, as the outsiders piled out of the cars and faced the entire population of the village, about two hundred people, who had turned out to welcome them. It was as if these well-dressed Westerners had dropped in from another planet, which in a sense they had. Young schoolchildren were pushed forward, and they performed a song. The visitors, in turn, gave the children notebooks and candy. There was an uncomfortable silence, broken when Marissa Mayer, the delegation&#x2019;s leader, a woman of thirty-two, said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s interact with them.&#x201d; The group fanned out and began to engage the villagers in awkward conversation.<br> <br>That is how Alex Vogenthaler came to ask a spindly young man with a wide smile whether he had heard of Google, Vogenthaler&#x2019;s employer. It was a question that he would never have had to ask in his home country: virtually everyone in the United States and everywhere in the wired-up world knew Google. Its uncannily effective Internet search product had changed the way people accessed information, changed the way they <i>thought</i> about information. Its 2004 IPO had established it as an economic giant. And its founders themselves were the perfect examples of the superbrainy engineering mentality that represented the future of business in the Internet age.<br> <br>The villager admitted that, no, he had never heard of this Google. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked. Vogenthaler tried to explain in the simplest terms that Google was a company that operated on the Internet. People used it to search for information. You would ask it a question, and it would immediately give you the answer from huge repositories of information it had gathered on the World Wide Web.<br> <br>The man listened patiently but clearly was more familiar with rice fields than search fields.<br> <br>Then the villager held up a cell phone. &#x201c;Is this you what mean?&#x201d; he seemed to ask.<br> <br>The little connectivity meter on the phone display had four bars. There are significant swaths of the United States of America where one can barely pull in a signal&#x2014;or gets no bars at all. But here in rural India, the signal was strong.<br> <br>Google, it turns out, was on the verge of a multimillion-dollar mobile effort to make smart phones into information prostheses, adjuncts to the human brain that would allow people to get information to a vast swath of all the world&#x2019;s knowledge instantly. This man might not know Google yet, but the company would soon be in Ragihalli. And then he <i>would</i> know Google.<br> <br>I witnessed this exchange in 2007 as an observer on the annual trip of Google associate product managers, a select group pegged as the company&#x2019;s future leaders. We began our journey in San Francisco and touched down in Tokyo, Beijing, Bangalore, and Tel Aviv before returning home sixteen days later.<br> <br>My participation on the trip had been a consequence of a long relationship with Google. In late 1998, I&#x2019;d heard buzz about a smarter search engine and tried it out. Google was miles better than anything I&#x2019;d used before. When I heard a bit about the site&#x2019;s method of extracting such good results&#x2014;it relied on sort of a web-based democracy&#x2014;I became even more intrigued. This is how I put it in the February 22, 1999, issue of <i>Newsweek:</i> &#x201c;Google, the Net&#x2019;s hottest search engine, draws on feedback from the web itself to deliver more relevant results to customer queries.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later that year, I arranged with Google&#x2019;s newly hired director of corporate communications, Cindy McCaffrey, to visit its Mountain View headquarters. One day in October I drove to 2400 Bayshore Parkway, where Google had just moved from its previous location above a Palo Alto bicycle shop. I&#x2019;d visited a lot of start-ups and wasn&#x2019;t really surprised by the genial chaos&#x2014;a vast room, with cubicles yet unfilled and a cluster of exercise balls. However, I hadn&#x2019;t expected that instead of being attired in traditional T-shirts and jeans, the employees were decked out in costumes. I had come on Halloween.<br> <br>&#x201c;Steven, meet Larry Page and Sergey Brin,&#x201d; said Cindy, introducing me to the two young men who had founded the company as Stanford graduate students. Larry was dressed as a Viking, with a long-haired fur vest and a hat with long antlers protruding. Sergey was in a cow suit. On his chest was a rubber slab from which protruded huge, wart-specked teats. They greeted me cheerfully and we all retreated to a conference room where the Viking and the cow explained the miraculous powers of Google&#x2019;s PageRank technology.<br> <br>That was the first of many interviews I would conduct at Google. Over the next few years, the company became a focus of my technology reporting at <i>Newsweek.</i> Google grew from the small start-up I had visited to a behemoth of more than 20,000 employees. Every day, billions of people used its search engine, and Google&#x2019;s remarkable ability to deliver relevant results in milliseconds changed the way the world got its information. The people who clicked on its ads made Google wildly profitable and turned its founders into billionaires&#x2014;and triggered an outcry among traditional beneficiaries of ad dollars.<br> <br>Google also became known for its irreverent culture and its data-driven approach to business decision making; management experts rhapsodized about its unconventional methods. As the years went by, Google began to interpret its mission&#x2014;to gather and make accessible and useful the world&#x2019;s information&#x2014;in the broadest possible sense. The company created a series of web-based applications. It announced its intention to scan all the world&#x2019;s books. It became involved in satellite imagery, mobile phones, energy generation, photo storage. Clearly, Google was one of the most important contributors to the revolution of computers and technology that marked a turning point in civilization. I knew I wanted to write a book about the company but wasn&#x2019;t sure how.<br> <br>Then in early July 2007, I was asked to join the associate product managers on their trip. It was an unprecedented invitation from a company that usually limits contact between journalists and its employees. The APM program, I learned, was a highly valued initiative. To quote the pitch one of the participants made in 2006 to recent and upcoming college graduates: &#x201c;We invest more into our APMs than any other company has ever invested into young employees.... We envision a world where everyone is awed by the fact that Google&#x2019;s executives, the best CEOs in the Silicon Valley, and the most respected leaders of global non-profits all came through the Google APM program.&#x201d; Eric Schmidt, Google&#x2019;s CEO, told me, &#x201c;One of these people will probably be our CEO one day&#x2014;we just don&#x2019;t know which one.&#x201d;<br> <br>The eighteen APMs on the trip worked all over Google: in search, advertising, applications, and even stealth projects such as Google&#x2019;s attempt to capture the rights to include magazines in its index. Mayer&#x2019;s team, along with the APMs themselves, had designed the agenda of the trip. Every activity had an underlying purpose to increase the participants&#x2019; understanding of a technology or business issue, or make them more (in the parlance of the company) &#x201c;Googley.&#x201d; In Tokyo, for instance, they engaged in a scavenger hunt in the city&#x2019;s legendary Akihabara electronics district. Teams of APMs were each given $50 to buy the weirdest gadgets they could find. Ducking into backstreets with stalls full of electronic parts and gizmos, they wound up with a cornucopia: USB-powered ashtrays shaped like football helmets that suck up smoke; a plate-sized disk that simulated the phases of the moon; a breathalyzer you could install in your car; and a stubby wand that, when waved back and forth, spelled out words in LED lights. In Bangalore, there was a different shopping hunt&#x2014;an excursion to the market area where the winner of the competition would be the one who haggled best. (Good training for making bulk purchases of computers or even buying an Internet start-up.) Another Tokyo high point was the 5 A.M. trip to the Tsukiji fish market. It wasn&#x2019;t the fresh sushi that fascinated the APMs but the mechanics of the fish auction, in some ways similar to the way Google works its AdWords program.<br> <br>In China, Google&#x2019;s top executive there, Kai-Fu Lee, talked of balancing Google&#x2019;s freewheeling style with government rules&#x2014;and censorship. But during interviews with Chinese consumers, the APMs were discouraged to hear the perception of the company among locals: &#x201c;Baidu [Google&#x2019;s local competitor] knows more [about China] than Google,&#x201d; said one young man to his APM interlocutors.<br> <br>At every office the APMs visited, they attended meetings with local Googlers, first learning about projects under way and then explaining to the residents what was going on at Mountain View headquarters. I began to get an insider&#x2019;s sense of Google&#x2019;s product processes&#x2014;and how serving its users was akin to a crusade. An interesting moment occurred in Bangalore when Mayer was taking questions from local engineers after presenting an overview of upcoming products. One of them asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve heard the road map for products, what&#x2019;s the road map for revenues?&#x201d; She almost bit his head off. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s <i>not</i> the way to think,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We are focused on our <i>users.</i> If we make them happy, we will have revenues.&#x201d;<br> <br>The most fascinating part of the trip was the time spent with the young Googlers. They were generally from elite colleges, with SAT scores approaching or achieving perfection. Carefully culled from thousands of people who would have killed for the job, their personalities and abilities were a reflection of Google&#x2019;s own character. During a bus ride to the Great Wall of China, one of the APMs charted the group demographics and found that almost all had parents who were professionals and more than half had parents who taught at a university&#x2014;which put them in the company of Google&#x2019;s founders. They all grew up with the Internet and considered its principles to be as natural as the laws of gravity. They were among the brightest and most ambitious of a generation that was better equipped to handle the disruptive technology wave than their elders were. Their minds hummed like tuning forks in resonance with the company&#x2019;s values of speed, flexibility, and a deep respect for data.<br> <br>Yet even while immersed in an optimism bubble with these young people, I could see the strains that came with Google&#x2019;s abrupt growth from a feisty start-up to a market-dominating giant with more than 20,000 employees. The APMs had spent a year navigating the folkways of a complicated corporation, albeit a determinedly different one&#x2014;and now they were almost senior employees. What&#x2019;s more, I was stunned when a poll of my fellow travelers revealed that not a single one of them saw him- or herself working for Google in five years. Marissa Mayer took this news calmly, claiming that such ambition was why they had been hired in the first place. &#x201c;This is the gene that Larry and Sergey look for,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Even if they leave, it&#x2019;s still good for us. They&#x2019;re going to take the Google DNA with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>After covering the company for almost a decade, I thought I knew it pretty well, but the rare view of the company I got in those two weeks made me see it in a different, wider light. Still, there were considerable mysteries. Google was a company built on the values of its founders, who harbored ambitions to build a powerful corporation that would impact the entire world, at the same time loathing the bureaucracy and commitments that running such a company would entail. Google professed a sense of moral purity&#x2014;as exemplified by its informal motto, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be evil&#x201d;&#x2014;but it seemed to have a blind spot regarding the consequences of its own technology on privacy and property rights. A bedrock principle of Google was serving its users&#x2014;but a goal was building a giant artificial intelligence learning machine that would bring uncertain consequences to the way all of us live. From the very beginning, its founders said that they wanted to change the world. But who were they, and what did they envision this new world order to be?<br> <br>After the trip I realized that the best way to answer these questions was to report as much as possible from inside Google. Just as I&#x2019;d had a rare glimpse into its inner workings during that summer of 2007, I would try to immerse myself more deeply into its engineering, its corporate life, and its culture, to report how it really operated, how it developed its products, and how it was managing its growth and public exposure. I would be an outsider with an insider&#x2019;s view.<br> <br>To do this, of course, I&#x2019;d need cooperation. Fortunately, based on our long relationship, Google&#x2019;s executives, including &#x201c;LSE&#x201d;&#x2014;Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt&#x2014;agreed to let me in. During the next two years&#x2014;a critical time when Google&#x2019;s halo lost some of its glow even as the company grew more powerful&#x2014;I interviewed hundreds of current and former Googlers and attended a variety of meetings in the company. These included product development meetings, &#x201c;interface reviews,&#x201d; search launch meetings, privacy council sessions, weekly TGIF all-hands gatherings, and the gatherings of the high command known as Google Product Strategy (GPS) meetings, where projects and initiatives are approved or rejected. I also ate a lot of meals at Andale, the burrito joint in Google&#x2019;s Building 43.<br> <br>What I discovered was a company exulting in creative disorganization, even if the creativity was not always as substantial as hoped for. Google had massive goals, and the entire company channeled its values from the founders. Its mission was collecting and organizing all the world&#x2019;s information&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s only the beginning. From the very start, its founders saw Google as a vehicle to realize the dream of artificial intelligence in augmenting humanity. To realize their dreams, Page and Brin had to build a huge company. At the same time, they attempted to maintain as much as possible the nimble, irreverent, answer-to-no-one freedom of a small start-up. In the two years I researched this book, the clash between those goals reached a peak, as David had become a Goliath.<br> <br>My inside perspective also provided me the keys to unlock more of the secrets of Google&#x2019;s two &#x201c;black boxes&#x201d;&#x2014;its search engine and its advertising model&#x2014;than had previously been disclosed. Google search is part of our lives, and its ad system is the most important commercial product of the Internet age. In this book, for the first time, readers can learn the full story of their development, evolution, and inner workings. Understanding those groundbreaking products helps us understand Google and its employees because their operation embodies both the company&#x2019;s values and its technological philosophy. More important, understanding them helps us understand our own world&#x2014;and tomorrow&#x2019;s.<br> <br>The science fiction writer William Gibson once said that the future is already here&#x2014;just not evenly distributed. At Google, the future is already under way. To understand this pioneering company and its people is to grasp our technological destiny. And so here is Google: how it works, what it thinks, why it&#x2019;s changing, how it will continue to change us. And how it hopes to maintain its soul.<br> <br>� 2011 Steven Levy</p><h2>The Spider Network: The Wild Story of a Math Genius, a Gang of Backstabbing Bankers, and One of the Greatest Scams in Financial History</h2><p><p><strong>SHORT-LISTED FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR</strong></p><p><strong>The&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></em><strong>'s award-winning business reporter unveils the bizarre and sinister story of how a math genius named Tom Hayes, a handful of outrageous confederates, and a deeply corrupt banking system ignited one of the greatest financial scandals in history.</strong></p><p>In 2006, an oddball group of bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world&#x2019;s largest financial institutions made a startling realization: Libor&#x2014;the London interbank offered rate, which determines interest rates on trillions in loans worldwide&#x2014;was set daily by a small group of easily manipulated functionaries.

One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn&#x2019;t . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. &nbsp;With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan, <i>Fairyland </i>lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and the soul of <i>The Golden Compass</i>, here is a reading experience unto itself: unforgettable, and so very beautiful.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011</strong>: Bibliophilic wyverns, enchanted woods, an evil Marquess, a magical talisman, dwarven customs agents, djinns, velocipedes--and that doesn't even take into account what's in the title of <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i>. A fantastical tale that's somewhere between Lewis Carroll and Terry Pratchett, Cathrynne Valente's book follows twelve-year-old September, a girl from Omaha, Nebraska, who finds herself whisked away by a fast-talking gentleman called the Green Wind to the world of Fairyland where she has to retrieve a witch's spoon from the fickle Marquess. Still, Cathrynne Valente's imaginative cast of characters and spirited prose turn what could be a standard heroine-on-a-quest story into something on par with the best (and weirdest) classics. <i>--Darryl Campbell</i> <br> <p> <strong>A Look at Ana Juan's Illustrations for <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i> </strong><br> <br> </p> <p></p><p></p><br><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exeunt on a Leopard</td> <td>The Wyverary</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td><td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Thy Mother's Sword</td> <td>One Hundred Years Old</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Cory Doctorow Reviews <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i></strong><br> <p><b>Cory Doctorow is a co-editor of the popular weblog BoingBoing and the author of <i>Little Brother</i>, <i>Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse</i>, and several other books.</b></p> <p>Valente's <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i>: sweet fairytale, shot through with salty tears -- magic!</p> <p>Feiwel &amp; Friends has done the world an enormous service by putting <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</i>, Catherynne M. Valente's extraordinary, award-winning, free web-novel, between covers. What's more, they've augmented it with Ana Juan's wonderful illustrations, one for every chapter.</p> <p><i>Fairyland</i> is a book that is both deeply in love with fairy tales and sharply critical of them: the story of September, a girl who flies from her dreary and sad life in Nebraska to Fairyland on the Green Wind. In Fairyland, she meets every sort of wonderful mythical beast (including a wyvern that's half library), eats the most wonderful and strange things, and has the most wonderful and extraordinary adventures and quests. And it really is wonderful: whimsical and lyrical and shot through with an imagination that simultaneously renders the traditional furniture of fairy tales fresh, and manages to make the author's own inventions seem as mythic as the first story told in the first cave in front of the first fire.</p> <p>But Valente's fairytale broods and seethes, and it is not always such a nice place. For every velocipede herd thundering across the plain, ridden by a marvelous fairy in aviator's leathers and jodhpurs, there's a whipped blue water-djinn who bears the emotional scars of slavery. For every autumn kingdom filled with fiery sylvan alchemists, there is a political exile in the winter country, banished and sorrowing. For every brave sacrifice from September's companions, there's an abandoned soap golem that wishes the good queen would restore Fairyland to its glory.</p> <p>And that's what makes Valente's work so truly fairytale fantastic: the sense that the magic sweetness is alloyed with a pinch of salty tears that makes it all so flavorful and complex, a wonder streaked with anxiety. So as September embarks on her quest to topple the evil Marquess who is bent on remaking Fairyland so that it is as dull and regimented as Omaha, Nebraska, we cheer her on, fear for her, and wonder, a little, if she might not be on the wrong side of the war.</p> <p>Valente's lyrical fairytale is billed as a young adult novel, but like all the very best young adult novels, this is a book that can (and should be!) enjoyed by grown ups too.</p> <br><p><b>CATHERYNNE M.

Which was unfortunate indeed.</p><p></p><p>"Here's the information you asked for," Ramirez said, placing the folder on his desk, looking as relaxed as he usually did.</p><p></p><p>That Ramirez had been betraying him for so long . . .</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen the evidence with his own eyes, he never would have believed it. Ramirez was like a son. A trusted son.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat," he said, using his normal tone, unwilling to give away what he knew just yet. He opened the folder, flipped through the contents. And sighed. "This is incomplete."</p><p></p><p>Ramirez frowned. "It is not. I compiled the data myself. That is everything that anyone knows about Thomas Thorne."</p><p></p><p>"It is not," he said, intentionally repeating his clerk's words. "I know this because I had Patton do the same search. The file he compiled is twice as thick. What you've given me is less than I could have gotten from searching Google myself." He deliberately closed the file and folded his hands. "What do you think I should do about this?"</p><p></p><p>Ramirez licked his lower lip, his first sign of nerves. "Do? About what?"</p><p></p><p>"About you, my friend." From his drawer, he pulled out the photos Patton had taken of Ramirez. And Thomas Thorne. Conspiring together. "Care to explain?"</p><p></p><p>Ramirez drew a breath. "You had me followed?"</p><p></p><p>"I did. Thorne seems to know a great deal about my operations. I wondered how he'd gotten all that information. I had all of my inner circle followed-by the person who'd get their job should they be shown to be the betrayer." He smiled. "Patton was extremely thorough. He'll make a very good head clerk."</p><p></p><p>Ramirez swallowed hard. "I never betrayed you."</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe you."</p><p></p><p>"Patton photoshopped those pictures."</p><p></p><p>He turned on his cell phone and swiped through the photos he had stored there. "Ah, here it is. You with Thorne." He held his phone out so that Ramirez could see the image. "I took this one myself."</p><p></p><p>Ramirez paled. Then he squared his shoulders and lifted his chin, acceptance of his fate in his eyes. "My wife had nothing to do with this."</p><p></p><p>He shrugged. "Then it's a pity she has to die, too."</p><p></p><p>"No." Ramirez leaped from his chair, reaching out as if he'd strangle him with his bare hands. But at the sight of the gun aimed at his head, he stopped abruptly and froze, breathing hard.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" he asked the clerk simply, holding his gaze. "Why did you give Thorne information?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't," Ramirez insisted.</p><p></p><p>"You're going to die either way, old friend. I can make it quick or make it last. I can also do the same for your lovely wife. Quick or slow torture? Tell me why."</p><p></p><p>Ramirez closed his eyes. "You killed my nephew."</p><p></p><p>He lifted his brows. "I did?"</p><p></p><p>"Your people did. He was sixteen, just a kid. Got caught in the cross fire when your guys did a drive-by two years ago. Except they picked the wrong fucking house and it was my sister's son who was filled with your bullets." Ramirez's eyes filled with fury and grief. "You weren't even sorry. I've worked for you for twenty years and you weren't even sorry."</p><p></p><p>"I'm still not sorry," he said, then lowered his aim to Ramirez's gut and pulled the trigger three times in rapid succession, creating a tight grouping of bullets. Ramirez slumped to the floor with a groan.</p><p></p><p>He stood, peering over his desk at the man writhing on his hardwood floor. Ramirez looked up, the fury and grief in his eyes now joined by shocked realization, intense pain, and all-consuming hate. "You said it would be quick," he gasped. "You lied."</p><p></p><p>"So did you."</p><p></p><p>"No, no." Ramirez groaned. "I told you the truth. I told you why I gave Thorne that information."</p><p></p><p>"Too little, too late, my old friend." He spat the final word. "You lied to me every single day that you came in to work for me, took a salary from me, all while you betrayed me."</p><p></p><p>Ramirez's pain-glazed eyes narrowed to a sneer. "And it's all about you, isn't it? My old friend?"</p><p></p><p>He blinked at that. "Of course. It's always about me." He stared down at Ramirez for another full minute. How had he missed that grief? That fury? That absolute hate?</p><p></p><p>He settled back in his chair, knowing full well the answer to that question. He'd missed it in Ramirez's eyes because he'd seen it in his own. In the mirror. Every damn day since the prison had delivered his son to the morgue in a body bag, minus his guts. Those had been spilled onto the dirt in the exercise yard when his son had been eviscerated, quickly and skillfully. But he'd suffered before he died.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, a wave of fresh pain rolling through him, clenching his chest so hard that he had to fight not to gasp. His son had suffered before drawing his last breath. God, how he'd suffered.</p><p></p><p>Ramirez was getting off easily, he thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>He pressed the intercom button. "Jeanne, can you send Patton in? Tell him to bring in Mrs. Ramirez and two body bags. Mr. Ramirez isn't quite dead yet, but he should be soon. Also give me a few minutes to dispatch Mrs. Ramirez, then send someone in with a wet-vac. My floor seems to be covered in blood."</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, sir," Jeanne said with an equanimity that he'd long admired. His office manager was pushing sixty, and he dreaded the day she'd retire. At least she was training her replacement, and he had to admit the girl had all of her mother's organizational skills. Jeanne's younger daughter, Margo, was as close to a daughter of his own as he'd ever had.</p><p></p><p>And Jeanne's older daughter, Kathryn, was as close to a soul mate as he'd ever have again. Kathryn warmed his heart and his bed, but they both knew that he would always grieve his Madeline. That Madeline had handpicked Kathryn to be her replacement had made the transition smoother, but Kathryn would never be his wife. Luckily she didn't expect to be. She was happy to be the mistress of a powerful man.</p><p></p><p>"Can I get you anything else?" Jeanne asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Tell Margo that I need to meet with her in about thirty minutes." The mother of his grandson, she and little Benny were all he had left of his son, Colin. Anguish speared his heart, but he welcomed the pain. Avenging his son's death was what gave him the strength to wake up each morning. "I have a job for her."</p><p></p><p>"You bastard," Ramirez gasped when his wife was brought in, bound and crying.</p><p></p><p>He smiled. "What is the expression? Pot, meet kettle? You have much nerve, Mr. Ramirez. Your betrayal will hurt so many more people than only yourself. You can excuse us, Mr. Patton, but don't go far. We'll need those body bags soon."</p><p></p><p>Standing, he removed his clothes, folding them neatly and storing them out of the way in the wardrobe. He liked this suit and didn't want it bloodied. Carefully, he lifted the leather thong over his head. From the end of it dangled a small vial containing Madeline's ashes. Soon he'd mix Colin's ashes with them.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the burn of pure rage, he put the vial on top of his clothes and shut the wardrobe door. "Now, Mrs. Ramirez, I will apologize in advance for the pain I'm about to cause you. When you are screaming curses, aim them at your husband. You're here because of his betrayal."</p><p></p><p>"I won't," Ramirez's wife stated forcefully. "I will never curse my husband."</p><p></p><p>But she did. They always cursed the one whose missteps had put them under his knife. In this case, his auger. Mrs. Ramirez suffered terribly before he finally took pity and put a bullet in her head.</p><p></p><p>Then he ended his former aide with a final bullet to his heart and showered off the mess. Once he was dressed again, he called for Patton to remove the bodies and sat down to read through his new head clerk's much fuller folder.</p><p></p><p>Patton had indeed been thorough, finding nearly everything he himself had found. There was nothing new here. His plan to bring Thomas Thorne to his knees had been in progress for months.</p><p></p><p>Thorne would beg for mercy, just as Ramirez's wife had. But just like with Mrs. Ramirez, there would be none.</p><p></p><p>Baltimore, Maryland</p><p>Saturday, June 11, 11:45 p.m.</p><p></p><p>"I'm out," J.D. said, tossing his cards to the table with an annoyed huff. "Fuck, Thorne. Do you have to win every damn hand?"</p><p></p><p>Thomas Thorne gave the five men sitting around his poker table a smug grin as he began to stack his chips. "Yes."</p><p></p><p>The others grumbled good-naturedly as they fished out their wallets.</p><p></p><p>"Your luck's too good tonight," Sam muttered, throwing a ten on the table. No one ever lost more than ten in an evening. They played for fun. And to win, of course. None of them liked losing.</p><p></p><p>Across the table, Grayson rolled his eyes. "I'm thinking his luck is way too good tonight. Maybe we should investigate. Sam? J.D.?"</p><p></p><p>"Lots of ways a man could cheat," J.D. agreed.</p><p></p><p>Grayson Smith, the senior assistant state's attorney, decorated homicide detective J.D. Fitzpatrick, and former Baltimore PD officer Sam Hudson would certainly know about many of those ways, but Thorne knew none of the men were really upset. Nor did they believe he'd actually cheat.</p><p></p><p>He'd earned their trust, just as they'd earned his.</p><p></p><p>"Knock yourselves out, boys," he said loftily, then made a point of looking at his watch. "Except you'll need to make it fast, on account of your curfew. You poor married boys have to go home."</p><p></p><p>J.D. snorted. "Asshole," he said, but it was with affection. J.D. was married to Lucy, an ME who'd come back from maternity leave to work part-time in the Baltimore morgue. But she and Thorne had been friends for years before J.D. came into the picture. For the past eight years, Lucy had been Thorne's partner in Sheidalin, the nightclub they owned with Gwyn Weaver.</p><p></p><p>Who Thorne had studiously not been thinking about all evening.</p><p></p><p>Liar.</p><p></p><p>Fine. Yes, he had been thinking about Gwyn all night, wondering if she'd actually gone on the date she'd been so excited about. If her date had any brains at all, the answer would be no. Either way, Thorne would have to wait until tomorrow to hear about it.</p><p></p><p>"Nah, he's not an asshole," Sam said. "Not a total one, anyway." Sam had left Baltimore PD the year before, taking a job as a PI for Thorne at the law firm he fondly called his "day job," even though the firm was his major focus. Sheidalin was primarily Gwyn's to manage. Thorne and Lucy were there mainly for the music, performing occasionally.</p><p></p><p>Although Thorne hadn't done so in some time. Four and a half years, to be exact. He missed it, playing his bass onstage in front of a live audience. But he'd had other things that needed his focus. There'd been his godson, Lucy's little boy. Jeremiah. He loved that kid.</p><p></p><p>And he'd had to take care of Gwyn, as much as she'd let him. Which wasn't that much.</p><p></p><p>Mostly, though, he'd focused on his firm. He'd built it up from a solo operation to one that employed two other attorneys, a paralegal, who managed the office, and a death investigator. And Sam, who'd proven himself a skilled PI. Thorne felt lucky to have him.</p><p></p><p>Sam was chuckling. "Thorne's just jealous because he's got to clean up this mess all by himself."</p><p></p><p>Yes, Thorne admitted, but only to himself. He was jealous of the married guys who had partners to go home to. Once they all left, his house would be far too quiet. But he'd never admit that to any of them, because they'd all conspire to fix him up. They were worse than old women in that respect.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he raised one brow. "Ruby cleans for you?" He pulled out his cell phone. "Should I ask her?" Sam's wife, Ruby, formerly Lucy's ME tech, was now Thorne's death investigator. He highly doubted she would actually clean up after Sam.</p><p></p><p>Sam laughed. "Please, no. I value my life."</p><p></p><p>"We single guys have to go, too," Jamie said with a sigh. He backed his wheelchair away from the table with an ease that came from a lifetime of practice. Born with spina bifida, he'd used a chair from the time he was a child. "I'm getting too old for these late nights."</p><p></p><p>Jamie's movements were only a little slower than they'd been when he and Thorne had first met, nineteen years before. Jamie Maslow had started out as his attorney but had quickly become his friend and mentor. And the closest thing he'd had to a father since his own dad had died when Thorne was just a boy. Now Jamie was his employee. Newly retired from his own firm, he did pro bono work for Thorne's.</p><p></p><p>"You wouldn't be single if you'd just marry Phil and make an honest man of him," Thorne said blandly. It had taken him months to stop calling Phil "Mr. Woods" when the two men had taken him in as a scared and abandoned teen.</p><p></p><p>His old history teacher had left the fancy prep school Thorne had attended years ago, dedicating his career to teaching kids in the inner city. Thorne admired them both so damn much. They'd been the role models he'd so desperately needed as a miserable kid. They'd given him a home when he had nowhere else to go.</p><p></p><p>"I keep asking him," Jamie said, a twinkle in his eye. "He says that when he retires, we're going to elope to Vegas and get married by Elvis."</p><p></p><p>Frederick snorted. "I think if you elope, you'll have a revolt on your hands." The newest member of their group, Frederick Dawson had recently come to Baltimore from California. Once a high-profile defense attorney in Oakland, he had recently become licensed in Maryland and worked with Jamie and Thorne on a pro bono basis. He gestured to the empty chip bags and beer bottles. "Seriously, you need help cleaning up before we haul our asses out of here?"</p><p></p><p>"Nah. It won't take me long." Thorne knew he was lucky. He had good friends, loyal and respectable. There had been a time when he didn't know if anyone respectable would ever give him the time of day. But even the best friends in the world had to go home sometime.</p><p></p><p>And I'll be alone. Still. Always.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Journey Through Wales and The Description of Wales (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Scholar, churchman, diplomat and theologian, Gerald of Wales was one of the most fascinating figures of the Middle Ages and The Journey Through Wales describes his eventful tour of the country as a missionary in 1188. In a style reminiscent of a diary, Gerald records the day-to-day events of the mission, alongside lively accounts of local miracles, folklore and religious relics such as Saint Patrick&#39;s Horn, and eloquent descriptions of natural scenery that includes the rugged promontory of St David&#39;s and the vast snow-covered panoramas of Snowdonia. The landscape is evoked in further detail in The Description, which chronicles the everyday lives of the Welsh people with skill and affection. Witty and gently humorous throughout, these works provide a unique view into the medieval world.</p><p>Gerald of Wales was born c.1145 in Pembrokeshire. He died in obscurity, possibly in Lincoln in 1223. He wrote seventeen books, all of them in Latin, and was well-connected to the Royal Family of his day. Lewis Thorpe was Professor of French at Nottingham University from 1958 to 1977. He was President of the British Branch of the International Arthurian Society.

I knew without turning that it was my platter of whole roast pig, the crowning glory of the vast meal I'd spent days creating for the supper party above stairs in this grand Mayfair house.<br><br>A less capable cook would have buried her face in her apron and sunk down into wailing, or perhaps run out through the scullery and shrieking into the night. I had a better head on my shoulders than that, even if I was not quite thirty years old, and so I stayed upright and calm, though stoic might be the more appropriate adjective.<br><br>"Leave it," I snapped at the footmen who were scampering after the clove-studded onions rolling about the floor. "I'll send up the fowl, and they'll have mutton to follow. Elsie, cease your shrieking and scrub those parsnips for me. A dice of them will have to do, but I must be quick."<br><br>The scullery maid, who'd screamed and then leveled obscenities at the footmen after being splashed with the juices in which the pig had been roasting, closed her mouth, snatched up the bowl of parsnips, and scurried back to the sink.<br><br>I ought to be mortified to serve a joint of mutton with saut�ed parsnips at Lady Cynthia's aunt's supper party in their elegant abode in Mount Street. But I was too worn down from the work that had gone into this night, too exasperated by the incompetence of the staff to worry at the moment. If I got the sack-well, I needed a rest.<br><br>But first to finish this meal. There was no use crying over spilled . . . pork.<br><br>My task was made more difficult by the fact that my kitchen assistant, Mary, whom I'd painstakingly trained all spring, had left a few days before-to get married, if you please.<br><br>I'd tried to tell the silly girl that looking after a husband was far more difficult than being in service ever would be. Husbands didn't pay wages, for one thing, and you never got any days out. Asking for extra pin money or an hour to oneself could send a husband into a towering rage and earn a wife a trip to the doctor, both to have her bruises seen to and so the doctor could assess whether there was something wrong with the woman's mind. A true wife was a sacrificing angel who asked nothing for herself.<br><br>I had taken time to explain this to Mary, but nothing had penetrated the haze of love into which she'd lapsed. Her young man seemed personable enough, at least upon first assessment. Some married couples rubbed along quite well, I'd heard, which definitely had not been the case for me.<br><br>I hadn't exactly given Mary my blessing, but I hadn't hindered her from going either. Lady Cynthia, at my behest, gave Mary a parting gift of a few guineas-or at least, Cynthia borrowed the sum from her uncle to give, as she hasn't a penny to her name.<br><br>However generous I'd been to Mary, her going left me shorthanded. The agency had not yet sent a satisfactory replacement, and the other maids in the house had too many chores of their own to be of much use to me. We had no housekeeper, as the woman previously in that position, Mrs. Bowen, had retired in March after a bereavement. None of the potential housekeepers Lady Cynthia's aunt had interviewed had taken the post, so many now that I feared the agencies would stop sending them altogether.<br><br>Therefore, the butler, Mr. Davis, and I struggled to do the housekeeping duties as well as our own. So of course Mary chose this very time to run away and leave us.<br><br>But I could not worry about that at present. At <i>this</i> moment, I had to save the feast.<br><br>I at last convinced the footmen to cease trying to put the roast-blackened pig back onto the platter, and to run up to the dining room to receive the two capons laden with carrots and greens I lifted into the dumbwaiter. The downstairs maid cranked the lift upward while I got on with chopping the parsnips Elsie had scrubbed and thrusting them into already boiling water. A quarter of an hour in and they'd be soft enough to brown with onions and carrots and adorn the mutton. A sauce of mint and lemon would accompany the meat, and the meal would finish with various sweet treats.<br><br>Those at least I'd made well in advance, and they already waited upstairs on a sideboard-a raspberry tart with chocolate film on its crust, a lemon and blueberry custard, ices in bright fruit flavors, a platter of fine cheeses, a chocolate g&#x2030;teau piled with cream, and a syllabub. Syllabub was a rather old-fashioned dish, but as it was full of sherry and brandy, I could not wonder that ladies and gentlemen of London still enjoyed it.<br><br>I was halfway through preparing the mutton, perspiration dripping down my neck and soaking my collar, when Mr. Davis appeared in the kitchen doorway.<br><br>Mr. Davis had been butler to Lady Cynthia's brother-in-law, Lord Rankin, for years, and could be haughty as you please above stairs. Below stairs, he dropped his toffee-nosed accent, sat about in his shirtsleeves, and gossiped like an old biddy. This evening he was in his full butler's kit, his eyes wide with consternation, the hairpiece he wore to cover his thinning hair on top askew.<br><br>"<i>Mrs. Holloway.</i>" His horrified gaze took in the skinless pig on the floor in a spreading puddle of spiced sauce, and two maids at the table chopping vegetables as though their lives depended upon it. One was the downstairs maid who'd helped send up the capons, the other the upstairs maid, Sara. I'd laid my hands on her and dragged her in to help when she'd been unwise enough to come down to the kitchen in search of something to eat.<br><br>"What the devil has happened?" Mr. Davis demanded. "I announced the&nbsp;pi�ce de r�sistance to Mr. and Mrs. Bywater and Lady Cynthia and all their guests-which include His Grace of Guildford and the Bishop of Dorset, I might add-and I uncover two chickens. The same as their Saturday lunch at home."<br><br>I did not bother to look up after one hasty and irritated glance at him. "It is perfectly obvious what happened. Your footmen are clumsy fools. And I'll thank you not to compare my <i>blanquette de poulet&nbsp;� l'estragon</i> to a Saturday lunch. They will find them tender and declare the fowl the best they've had in years. Now, unless you wish to don an apron and peel carrots, you may leave my kitchen." When he only stood in the middle of the floor, his mouth open, I took up the paring knife that lay next to me. "At once, Mr. Davis."<br><br>I'd only intended to hand him the knife and tell him to get on with the carrots if he continued to stare at me, but Mr. Davis eyed the blade, took a hasty step back, and then scuttled away, nearly tripping over the mountain of pig in his haste.<br>How we finished the meal, I have little recollection. Somehow, the two maids and I had the vegetables peeled, chopped, saut ed, and seasoned, the mutton sauced and presented quite prettily, and everything hauled upstairs via the dumbwaiter.<br><br>Sara, who had at first resented mightily that I'd recruited her for kitchen duty, beamed as the last of the food went up, and impulsively hugged the downstairs maid. Sara looked as though she wished to embrace me, but I stepped out of her reach before she could give in to the impulse.<br><br>"I'll never doubt you again, Mrs. Holloway," Sara said. "You worked a miracle. Like a general, you are."<br><br>I abandoned the kitchen, letting the footmen clean up the remains of the roasted pig-which I knew they'd devour or rush it home to their families as soon as I was out of sight. If I wasn't in the room to see it go, I couldn't stop them, could I?<br><br>I'd eaten little tonight, but I crossed the passage to sink down at the table in the servants' hall, thoroughly tired of food. I slumped in my chair a moment until my shaking ceased, and then I drew my notebook from my apron pocket and began to jot my thoughts on the meal.<br><br>I did this most nights, especially after I'd prepared a large repast. The notes were for my own guidance or perhaps would be used to train my assistant, if I ever found another one.<br><br>Sara brought me a cup of tea, for which I thanked her warmly. She looked upon me with admiration-at last, after my three months of employment in this house in Mount Street, she had found respect for me.<br><br>I wrote in relative peace for a time-jotting down what had turned out well in the meal, and what needed more polish. I did my best to ignore the noises across the hall-I heard more broken dishes and made a note to ask for funds to replace them.<br><br>Mr. Davis found me there an hour later. I'd longed ceased to write, my pen idle on the paper, my thoughts far from the meal and the noises around me.<br><br>Earlier this week, on my half day out, I'd gone to a lane near St. Paul's Churchyard to spend the time with my daughter. She'd grown an inch since I'd taken this post, becoming more of a young lady every time I saw her. One day, I vowed, I'd take what I'd saved of my wages, and Grace and I would live in a house together, looking after each other.<br><br>My daughter and I always made a special outing when I visited, and that day we'd gone to look at exhibits in the British Museum. Quite a few antiquities had been flowing back to London these days from archaeological digs in Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the Near East, and ladies and gentlemen flocked to see them-mummies, sarcophagi, and little dolls that had accompanied the ancient Egyptians into their tombs; as well as more cheerful things like vases, jewelry, jars, and combs from the civilizations of Greece and Rome, and tablets of writing only scholars could read.<br><br>While we'd stood waiting to enter the building, I'd sworn I'd seen the face of a man I knew. His name was Daniel McAdam, a gentleman I'd come to look upon as a friend-a very close friend.<br><br>Of late, though, I'd revised that opinion. I'd seen much of Daniel in the early spring, and then nothing at all in the last two months. Not a sign of him, not a glimpse of him, not a dickey bird, as I would have said in my youth. As I'd lectured Mary about marriage, in the back of my mind was a promise that I'd not make a fool of myself over a man ever again. I vowed I'd put Daniel straight out of my head.<br><br>However, when I'd glimpsed a gentleman in a plain suit coming out of another door in the museum, his dark hair barely tamed under a black bowler hat, every ounce of my resolve fled. I'd found myself stepping out of the queue, craning to see him, turning away to follow him when he walked off toward Bedford Square, blast it.<br><br>Only Grace's puzzled query-"Where are you going, Mum?"-had brought me to my senses.<br><br>Mr. Davis cleared his throat, and I jumped, opening my eyes. I seemed to have dozed off.<br><br>"Lady Cynthia wishes to see you," Mr. Davis announced, looking too smug about that. "You're for it now, Mrs. H."<br><br>I gave him a prim stare. "I am quite busy, Mr. Davis. I must prepare for tomorrow."<br><br>A cook's work is never done. While the rest of the household sits back and pats their full stomachs, I am in my kitchen starting dough for tomorrow's bread, making lists of what I'll need for the next day's meals, prepping any ingredients I can, and making sure the scullery maid has finished the washing up.<br><br>Mr. Davis had shed his coat, and damp patches adorned his shirtsleeves beneath his arms. His brows climbed. "You expect me to go upstairs and tell her ladyship you're too busy to speak to her?"<br><br>"She will understand." I liked Lady Cynthia, for all her eccentricities, but at the moment, I did not wish to have a conversation with anyone at all.<br><br>Mr. Davis eyed me closely, but I turned a page of my notebook and pointedly took up my pen.<br><br>As I bent over my notes, he heaved a great sigh, and then his footsteps receded. He stepped into his pantry-probably to fetch his coat-then I heard him start up the stairs. He was gone, and blissful quiet descended.<br><br>The peace was shattered not many minutes later by heels clicking sharply on the slate floor and an impatient rustle of taffeta. A breeze burst over me as a lady stormed into the servants' hall and leaned her fists on the tabletop in a very unladylike manner.<br><br>She had a fine-boned face and very fair hair, lovely if one enjoys the pale-skinned, aristocratic version of beauty. Her high-necked and long-sleeved gown was deep gray with black soutache trim-she wore mourning for her sister, recently deceased.<br><br>I jumped to my feet. She straightened as I did so, a frown slanting her brows, her light blue eyes filled with agitation.<br><br>"It is important, Mrs. H.," Lady Cynthia said. "I need your help. Clementina's going out of her head with worry."<br><br>I had no idea who Clementina was-I assumed one of Lady Cynthia's vast acquaintance.<br><br>"I beg your pardon, my lady. What has happened?"<br><br>"She was here tonight, very upset." Cynthia waved impatiently at the chairs. "Oh, do let us sit down. Davis, bring me tea to steady my nerves, there's a good chap."<br><br>Davis, who'd followed Lady Cynthia down, stuck his nose in the air at being ordered about like a footman and said a haughty, "Yes, my lady." He glided out to shout into the kitchen for someone to make a pot of tea for her ladyship and be quick about it.<br><br>I had not seen much of Lady Cynthia since Lord Rankin had retreated to his country estate to console himself. He'd allowed Lady Cynthia to remain living in his London house, which revealed a kindness in him that surprised me.

Her parents, the Earl and Countess of Clifford, lived in impoverished isolation in Hertfordshire, and I knew Cynthia had no desire to return to them.<br><br>An unmarried lady could not live alone without scandal, however, so Cynthia's aunt and uncle-the respectable Mr. Neville Bywater, younger brother to Cynthia's mother, and his wife, Isobel-had moved into Lord Rankin's house to look after her.

I. Warshawski Novel</h2><p>Among the first, and perhaps the most compelling, female private investigators of contemporary fiction, Sara Paretsky's incomparable character V. I. Warshawski at last returns to the page in her first full-length appearance since 1994's <b>Tunnel Vision</b>. <b>Hard Time</b> is the work of a master--a riveting novel of suspense that is indisputably Paretsky's best V.I. Warshawski novel yet. Multimedia conglomerate Global Entertainment has purchased the Chicago Herald-Star, forcing the paper's staff to scramble to stay employed. Reporter Murray Ryerson, V.I.'s longtime friend and sometime rival, manages to reinvent himself as the host of a television show on Global's network. <br><br>On her way home from a party celebrating Murray's debut, V.I. almost runs over a woman lying in the street. Stopping to help, V.I. soon learns that her Good Samaritan act will drop her squarely in a boiling intrigue. In a case that forces her to go head-to-head with one of the world's largest providers of private security and prison services, a case that exposes dark hidden truths behind the razzle-dazzle of the entertainment industry, V.I. will be ahead of the game if she gets out alive.</p><p>V.I. Warshawski, Sara Paretsky's tough-talking, dog-loving, justice-seeking private investigator has been missing in action since 1994, when she ratted out a big city political scandal on the streets of Chicago in <i>Tunnel Vision</i>. But now our Vic is back for her ninth adventure--a wee bit older, a tad more jaded, and as broke as ever. It all begins when Warshawski weasels an invitation to the hottest event in town, a glitzy party celebrating television's brightest new star, Lacey Dowell, or, as she's better known, the Mad Virgin. Vic's old pal (and one-time fling) Murray Ryerson now works for Global Enterprises, the corporate giant behind the Lacey sensation. On the way back from the party, Vic almost runs over a woman lying in the middle of the road, her Mad Virgin T-shirt soaked in blood from an earlier beating. The victim, Nicola Aguinaldo, dies in hospital, and Vic quickly realizes that a particularly nasty cop, Detective Lemour, intends to frame her for vehicular homicide. Her anger at these absurd charges hits the boiling point when Nicola's body disappears from the morgue before an autopsy can be carried out. Why was this woman, an escapee from the local Coolis prison, so important to Lemour? And why does the whole Mad Virgin phenomenon smell so rotten? "I didn't want to dive into Nicola Aguinaldo's wreck," V.I. grouses, "but it felt as though someone had climbed up behind me on the high board to give me a shove." In her search for answers, Warshawski runs afoul of Global Enterprises magnate Edmund Trant, and Robert Baladine, the head honcho of the nation's biggest security firm. They have enough clout to have V.I. thrown into Coolis for another crime she did not commit. But incarceration gives the resourceful Vic a perfect opportunity to snoop into Nicola's last days there--and uncover a sensational scandal.<p> As she has done throughout the series, Paretsky brilliantly juxtaposes strikingly different environments. Here she contrasts the dilapidated environs of the jail with the exorbitant homes of Chicago's filthy rich. In fact, readers who have anxiously awaited V.I. Warshawski's return will be glad to find that little has changed in her world. Mitch and Peppy the wonder dogs are as endearing as ever, her landlord, Mr. Contreras, is his normal fearless self, and V.I. is victorious. It really is like coming home. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>In an instant, the lives of two women collided. One was behind the wheel of a Trans Am she liked to drive too fast. The other was lying in the road, dying an agonizing death. When Chicago private eye V.I. Warshawski got out of her car to look at the woman she almost hit, she began a long, harrowing descent into a world of shadowy secrets and tangled lives -- and into the darkest heart of her city.<p>In her eagerly awaited new novel, which heralds the return of the much-loved heroine V.I. Warshawski, Sara Paretsky revisits the gritty urban landscape she illuminates with brilliant compassion and vivid color. For as V.I. unravels the mystery of a battered and discarded woman, she moves through circles of the rich and the troubled, into the bitter home of a powerful Chicago family, into the pampered world of a TV star, and behind the razor wire of a women's prison. What V.I. finds is a web of conspiracy -- and explosive secrets hidden in the darkest places of all....</p></p><h2>It Had to Be You (Chicago Stars, 1)</h2><p><p>The Windy City isn&#x2019;t quite ready for Phoebe Somerville -- the outrageous, curvaceous New York knockout who has just inherited the Chicago Stars football team.

Since that time a tremendous resurgence of interest in the Indian way of life has occurred, resurgence due in part, at least, to the Laubins' life-long efforts at preservation and interpretation of Indian culture.</p> <p>As <em>The Indian Tipi </em>makes obvious, the American Indian is both a practical person and a natural artist. Indian inventions are commonly both serviceable <em>and </em>beautiful. Other tents are hard to pitch, hot in summer, cold in winter, poorly lighted, unventilated, easily blown down, and ugly to boot. The conical tipi of the Plains Indian has none of these faults. It can be pitched by one person. It is roomy, well ventilated at all times, cool in summer, well lighted, proof against high winds and heavy downpours, and, with its cheerful fire inside, snug in the severest winter weather. Moreover, its tilted cone, trim smoke flaps, and crown of poles, presenting a different silhouette from every angle, form a shapely, stately dwelling even without decoration.</p> <p>In this new edition the Laubins have retained all the invaluable aspects of the first edition, and have added a tremendous amount of new material on day-to-day living in the tipi: the section on Indian cooking has been expanded to include a large number and range of Indian foods and recipes, as well as methods of cooking over an open fire, with a reflector oven, and with a ground oven; there are new sections on making buckskin, making moccasins, and making cradle boards; there is a whole new section on child care and general household hints. Shoshoni, Cree, and Assiniboine designs have been added to the long list of tribal tipi types discussed.</p> <p>This new edition is richly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, and drawings to aid in constructing and living in the tipi. It is written primarily for the interested amateur, and will appeal to anyone who likes camping, the out-of-doors, and American Indian lore.</p></p><p><p><strong>Reginald and Gladys Laubin</strong>, his late wife, have devoted their personal and professional lives to the preservation and interpretation of American Indian dance and culture.

Stolen, tortured, and enslaved as a young boy, Imriel is now a Prince of the Blood, third in line for the throne in a land that revels in beauty, art, and desire. <br>After a year abroad to study at university, Imriel returns from his adventures a little older and somewhat wiser. But perhaps not wise enough. What was once a mere spark of interest between himself and his cousin Sidonie now ignites into a white-hot blaze. But from commoner to peer, the whole realm would recoil from any alliance between Sidonie, heir to the throne, and Imriel, who bears the stigma of his mother's misdeeds and betrayals. Praying that their passion will peak and fade, Imriel and Sidonie embark on an intense, secret affair. <br>Blessed Elua founded Terre d'Ange and bestowed one simple precept to guide his people: <i>Love as thou wilt</i>. When duty calls, Imriel honors his role as a member of the royal family by leaving to marry a lovely, if merely sweet, Alban princess. By choosing duty over love, Imriel and Sidonie may have unwittingly trespassed against Elua's law. But when dark powers in Alba, who fear an invasion by Terre d'Ange, seek to use the lovers' passion to bind Imriel, the gods themselves take notice. <br>Before the end, Kushiel's justice will be felt in heaven and on earth.</p><p>Jacqueline Carey's previous publications include various short stories, essays, a nonfiction book <em>Angels: Celestial Spirits in Legend and Art</em>, as well as the nationally bestselling Kushiel's Legacy series.D&#39;Angeline royal family member Imriel de la Courcel forsakes the first precept--&#34;love as thou wilt&#34;--and marries a royal princess to forge an alliance of kingdoms. But his heart changes when he and his pregnant princess are viciously attacked, and he executes far-reaching vengeance upon those responsible. Simon Vance&#39;s clipped British accent and precise enunciation lend a beautiful otherworldly ambiance to this fantasy. His metered pace ensures that every word, sentence, and scene are savored. Authentic British and Irish character accents, male and female voices, and emotional nuances are easily distinguishable. Although there are intermittent periods where inordinate details hinder the story&#39;s pace, Vance&#39;s delivery helps maintain listener interest.

Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History</h2><p>Smedley Butler&#39;s life and career epitomize the contradictory nature of American military policy through the first part of this century. Butler won renown as a Marine battlefield hero, campaigning in most of America&#39;s foreign military expeditions from 1898 to the late 1920s. He became the leading national advocate for paramilitary police reform. Upon his retirement, however, he renounced war and imperialism and devoted his energy and prestige to various dissident and leftist political causes.</p><p>Butler joined the Marines in 1898 and saw action all over the world, winning two Medals of Honor, but he is remembered not so much for his military exploits as for his apostasy during his latter years. A statement he made in 1935 sums up the drastic turnabout: "I spent 33 years in the Corps, and spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business." He also said he had been a racketeer for capitalism who "helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street." Schmidt, a lecturer in history at the University of Hong Kong, traces Butler's stormy career: his various expeditionary campaigns, his central role in internal Marine Corps politics during the 1920s and his bizarre but effective war on crime and vice in Philadelphia.

Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<p> Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book. </p><p> Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. "This is a bad land for Gods," says Shadow.</p><p> More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><i>American Gods</i> by Neil Gaiman has won the 2001 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel at the Horror Writers Association Annual Meeting held that was held June 7-9 in New York City.</p><h2>Answer Key to &#34;Old World and America&#34;</h2><p>An extremely valuable and helpful resource that will save hours for the busy teacher or homeschooling parent.

In that time, they have traveled far and wide in search of adventure. Now they have been summoned by Professor Cake for a new mission: To find a twelve-year-old bookmender named Sophie Quire.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sophie knows little beyond the four walls of her father&#x2019;s bookshop, where she repairs old books and dreams of escaping the confines of her dull life. But when a strange boy and his talking cat/horse companion show up with a rare and mysterious book, she finds herself pulled into an adventure beyond anything she has ever read.</p><p><b>Jonathan Auxier</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Night Gardener</i> and<i> Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes</i>, which the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>called &#x201c;as delightful a magical story as readers . . . will hope to find.&#x201d; He teaches children&#x2019;s literature and lives in Pittsburgh with his family. www.thescop.com.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;In the grand tradition of Cornelia Funke's Inkheart and John Stephens's The Emerald Atlas comes this companion novel to Auxier's Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes. Twelve-year-old Sophie Quire mends books in her father's shop and worries about Pyre Day, when Inquisitor Prigg will burn all the storybooks and purge all the "nonsense" from Bustleburgh. Enter dauntless Peter Nimble, the blindfolded thief, and his enchanted companion Sir Tode with the Book of Who for Sophie to mend. The Book is one of four magical tomes (Who, What, Where, When); if all four books are collected, they will unlock a riddle and save the world. Sophie, Peter, and Sir Tode follow the book's clues, dogged by Inquisitor Prigg, his bloodthirsty henchman Torvald Knucklemeat, and Madame Eldritch the potion maker, a tricky woman with her own motives. The final battle to retrieve the books assembles most of the cast in Bustleburgh, where the story began. It's impossible to feel lukewarm about Auxier's work. This author so clearly views books as the elixir of life, and this conviction oozes out of the text. This fast-paced, character-gallery book remains anchored by Sophie's passion for reading and family. Various magical settings like a menagerie surrounded by deadly quickbramble serve as proper backdrop for capacious bestiaries that can describe any person or thing in existence. The final unraveling of the dangers Sophie faces is so intense readers may need to take a breath as they turn the pages.

When the city fell on July 4, 1863, after a protracted siege, it was a personal triumph for Grant and contributed largely to his later promotion to command of all the Union armies.

What were once considered normal human events and common human problems&#x2015;birth, aging, menopause, alcoholism, and obesity&#x2015;are now viewed as medical conditions. For better or worse, medicine increasingly permeates aspects of daily life.</p><p>Building on more than three decades of research, Peter Conrad explores the changing forces behind this trend with case studies of short stature, social anxiety, "male menopause," erectile dysfunction, adult ADHD, and sexual orientation. He examines the emergence of and changes in medicalization, the consequences of the expanding medical domain, and the implications for health and society. He finds in recent developments&#x2015;such as the growing number of possible diagnoses and biomedical enhancements&#x2015;the future direction of medicalization. </p><p>Conrad contends that the impact of medical professionals on medicalization has diminished. Instead, the pharmaceutical and biotechnical industries, insurance companies and HMOs, and the patient as consumer have become the major forces promoting medicalization. This thought-provoking study offers valuable insight into not only how medicalization got to this point but also how it may continue to evolve.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Conrad</b> is the Harry Coplan Professor of Social Sciences at Brandeis University.

His firm traded for its own account, and Bodek answered only to himself and to a few wealthy partners who&#x2019;d bankrolled the firm.<br><br>He wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way. No twitchy investors pulling cash every time the market dipped. And no prying questions about the state-of-the-art Machine he&#x2019;d created.<br><br>No one knew how the Machine worked but Bodek.<br><br>But now the Machine wasn&#x2019;t working. Even worse, Bodek wasn&#x2019;t sure why. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d been up all night. If he didn&#x2019;t solve the problem, it could destroy Trading Machines--and his career.<br><br>What made the Machine tick was a series of complex algorithms that collectively reflected a two decades&#x2019; tradition of elite trading strategies. Bodek had personally designed the algos using a branch of artificial intelligence called expert systems. The approach boiled down the knowledge gained by experts in market analysis and crunched incoming market data in order to make incredibly accurate predictions. It combined various models that financial engineers had used over the years to price options--contracts that give the holder the &#x201c;option&#x201d; to buy or sell a stock at a particular price within a certain time frame--with new twists on strategies that savvy traders had once used to -haggle over prices in the pits.<br><br>But many of those old-school strategies, geared with cutting-edge AI upgrades that permitted them to compete head-to-head in the electronic crowd, were nearly unrecognizable now. The market had entered a phase of such rapid mind-throttling change that even the most advanced traders were in a fog.<br><br>The problem that threatened Trading Machines, Bodek believed, was a bug hidden in the data driving his ranks of algos, hundreds of thousands of lines of code used by the computer-driven trading outfit that he&#x2019;d launched with sky&#x2019;s-the-limit dreams in late 2007. The code told the Machine when to trade, what to trade, and how to trade it, all with split-second timing.<br><br>Bodek, whose seriously pale skin, high forehead, and piercing blue eyes gave him the appearance of a Russian chess master, was a wizard of data. It was the air he breathed, the currency of his profession. An expert in artificial intelligence, he&#x2019;d made a career of crunching masses of numbers, finding form inside chaos. To discover order in the ocean of information that made up the market required incredible computer power and ingenious trading systems.<br><br>Bodek had both. He was so skilled at discovering patterns in the market&#x2019;s daily ebb and flow that he&#x2019;d risen to the top of the trading world, working first at an elite Chicago firm, packed with math and physics Ph.D.s, called Hull Trading, then inside an elite quantitative derivatives operation at Goldman Sachs, before taking over a powerful global desk at UBS, the giant Swiss bank. In 2007, he broke out on his own and convinced twenty-five top-notch traders, programmers, and quants (an industry term for mathematicians who use quantitative techniques to predict markets) from across Wall Street to join him. He set up shop in Stamford and launched Trading Machines just as signs emerged of an impending global financial crisis. It had amounted to one of the most ambitious trading projects outside a large investment bank in years.<br><br>Despite the bad timing, Trading Machines had fared well in its debut, posting a tidy profit during a time when most of Wall Street was imploding.<br><br>Then something went wrong with the Machine. Bodek was on a mission to fix it. Whatever it was.<br><br>As the morning progressed, Bodek&#x2019;s team of traders and programmers filed into Trading Machines&#x2019; third-floor office space. They stepped gingerly around Bodek as if he were a hair-trigger land mine.<br><br>The slightest pressure could set off an explosion. Not of anger--Bodek was as levelheaded as a fighter pilot--but of talk. Bodek was a legendary talker, a deep well of stories and analogies and long digressions and digressions on digressions. His was a mind trained to focus on minutiae, and it could be exhausting for listeners exposed to its relentless probing, like a powerful searchlight that never stopped sweeping the ground for new information. He could rarely get far into a conversation before he would say with extreme urgency something along the lines of &#x201c;What I&#x2019;m trying to say is there are five points I need to make before we can address the first of those ten points I mentioned earlier.&#x201d; Inside the firm, this was known as &#x201c;getting Haimed.&#x201d;<br><br>Bodek wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to talk that morning. His eyes darkly circled, he sat frozen in his chair, staring at his stacked monitors, mumbling to himself in fits and starts, his hands rising on occasion from his keyboard to pincer his blade-shaved head above the ears as if he were trying to squeeze more juice from his sleep-deprived brain. All the stress had taken a toll. While he was just thirty-eight years old, he appeared a good decade older.<br><br>Bodek&#x2019;s entire Wall Street career, from Hull to Goldman Sachs to his own trading desk at UBS, had been one long march from victory to victory. Whenever faced with an obstacle no one thought he could overcome, he&#x2019;d pull off a miracle. Failure had never seemed possible.<br><br>And yet here it was. He could see it, there, on his five screens, in the data that tallied up the firm&#x2019;s dwindling profits. As Bodek sat there, mystified by the behavior of an electronic trading ecosystem he&#x2019;d helped invent, he focused his formidable brain power on figuring out what the hell was going on.<br><br>The answer that would solve his problems was also there, he thought, on those screens, hiding amid all the data.<br><br>But where?<br><br>Shortly before 9 a.m., Bodek&#x2019;s partner, Thong-Wei Koh, a six-foot-two crack mathematician from Singapore, took his seat a few desks away from Bodek. The two founders didn&#x2019;t exchange a word. They&#x2019;d been fighting tooth and nail for the past few months. A partnership that had started with visions of glory had descended into a bitter daily feud.<br><br>TW was obsessed with mastering risk. At UBS, he&#x2019;d designed a trading system so ingenious that it could never lose a large amount of money--at least according to the math. But now, at Trading Machines, risk was everywhere. He was drowning in it. He&#x2019;d become so stressed out by the firm&#x2019;s problems that he&#x2019;d come down with chronic stomach cramps. Bodek, for his part, was wracked by headaches and insomnia.<br><br>He began to stir out of his morning torpor as the start of the trading day neared. It was 9:15 a.m.<br><br>Time for the War Song.<br><br>Bodek plugged his iPod into a dock and pressed the play button. Pounding electric guitar chords screeched from the dock&#x2019;s speakers: the manic Viking heavy metal he loved--and everyone else in the room loathed. As a teenager, Bodek had played drums in a thrash band. Ever since, his taste in music had gone one way: loud, angry, violent.<br><br>He was trying to teach his team a lesson with the music. It was how he viewed trading: It was war. Us against them. The market was the field of battle. The weapons: brains aided by powerful computers and lightning-fast algos.<br><br>Head nodding to the earth-shaking metal, Bodek stood wearily from his chair, his tie hanging loosely around his wrinkled white shirt. While Bodek always dressed the part of a white-shoe banker--gold cuff links, silk tie, patent-leather shoes--he relished the contradictions his outfit implied as the Viking metal pounded away. Once, on a dare at a metal show in 2007, he&#x2019;d leapt into a raging mosh pit dressed in his suit and tie . . . and lived to tell about it.<br><br>Clearing his throat, he rapped for good luck the Spartan helmet perched atop one of his monitors and clapped his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, guys,&#x201d; he said, machine-gun drums and psycho guitar riffs pulsating off the walls of the office. &#x201c;Yesterday was bad. We got killed again. But we can&#x2019;t give up. We&#x2019;ve got to fight this motherfucker! We&#x2019;ve got to keep focused! Stay with me!&#x201d;<br><br>There was a reason for urgency. That summer, word had gotten out on the grapevine that Trading Machines was foundering. Now Bodek&#x2019;s top guns were getting poached by competitors who sensed blood in the water.<br><br>To keep the ship afloat, Bodek was doing the work of three employees, staying at the office all night writing code, testing new strategies, digging deep into the guts of the Machine to figure out what had gone wrong. But he couldn&#x2019;t do much more, and he needed everyone to pitch in if the firm was going to right itself.<br><br>&#x201c;I know it looks bad, but we can turn it around, I know it,&#x201d; Bodek said. &#x201c;We can do it! Today we&#x2019;re going to fucking kill it, OK! Now, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone turned to his screen and started working. Right as the market opened, Trading Machines got whacked. For months it had been the same. Death by a thousand cuts. Sheer torture. As the nicks and cuts mounted, TW watched in frustration, obsessively clicking a pen, sighing, letting out brief bursts of anger, muttering curses under his breath.<br><br>Suddenly, the Machine froze. Trading stopped. TW pounded his fist on the desk. &#x201c;What the fuck is going on, Haim!&#x201d; he shouted, glaring sharply at Bodek.<br><br>This had happened before.<br><br>Bodek started to scramble, calling up the code he&#x2019;d worked on overnight. &#x201c;Must be a bug,&#x201d; he muttered, frantically typing.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddammit!&#x201d;<br><br>Groans echoed around the trading room.<br><br>Bodek combed through the code and quickly found the problem. A half hour later, Trading Machines was up and running again--only to keep taking losses, again and again, like clockwork.<br><br>Trading Machines&#x2019; nightmare started in the spring of 2009. Bodek had been on a trip to Hawaii for a relative&#x2019;s wedding. For a brief moment, he&#x2019;d had time to relax and reflect on all he&#x2019;d accomplished in the past decade, since joining Hull. He had it all. Money. A beautiful wife, a classically trained musician with the mental chops to match Bodek himself. A beautiful house on the beach in Stamford. Three beautiful children. Most important: He had his freedom.<br><br>When he returned to Trading Machines&#x2019; office in early June, he instantly grew worried. The firm&#x2019;s profits were dropping sharply. Bodek started combing through the nuts and bolts of the Machine, hunting for the problem. He couldn&#x2019;t find it. Since then, Trading Machines had been getting hammered, day after day, bleeding away its gains. It was still making money, but its profits had been reduced by $15,000 a day--sometimes more--all through the summer and into the fall. Now, its gains weren&#x2019;t enough to keep up with the firm&#x2019;s costs, especially the nosebleed salaries Bodek had promised to get all that top-gun talent and the expensive technology his strategy demanded.<br><br>It was a terminal path. Eventually, the firm would run out of cash. The clock was ticking on Trading Machines.<br><br>Through that December morning and into the afternoon, Bodek sat immobile in his chair, mesmerized by his stack of screens. He barely moved, aside from his fingers flying at the keyboard, his bloodshot eyes darting from screen to screen.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t unusual. Bodek almost never left his chair during the trading day. He didn&#x2019;t eat or even drink water until the market closed at 4 p.m. He rarely spoke. As he sat there, watching the numbers stream by, he was peering into the depths of the market, reading it like an Egyptologist scanning faded hieroglyphics.<br><br>There&#x2019;s Goldman coming in. That&#x2019;s UBS. Hell, I designed that trade myself in 2005. They&#x2019;re screwing it up.<br><br>Bodek&#x2019;s Machine was screwing up, too. He saw it happen all day long. He knew its signs.<br><br>Like now.<br><br>His eyes widened as he saw another wave coming in. He was tracking the SPDR S&amp;P 500 exchange-traded fund widely known as the Spyder. The Spyder was one of the most heavily traded securities in the world--and one of Bodek&#x2019;s favorites. It was hovering a few pennies above $112.<br><br>Like mutual funds, ETFs represent a basket of stocks, bonds, or other assets such as gold. They&#x2019;re traded as a unit and mimic the value of the underlying assets. Unlike mutual funds, they can be traded continuously on exchanges--like a stock. The first ETF, the Spyder, was created in 1993. It tracked the S&amp;P 500, an index of five hundred of the largest public companies in the United States. Other ETFs tracked the Dow Jones Industrial Average--the Diamonds--and the Nasdaq 100--called the Qs due to its QQQ ticker symbol.<br><br>The funds were like thermometers tracking the health of the market. As such, computer-driven funds, as well as everyday traders, watched them like hawks for any blip in performance.<br><br>One of those blips was about to happen. All was quiet in the room. Perhaps too quiet. Everyone was waiting for the Machine to act. Bodek caught his breath. Now . . . <br><br>Not again.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh fuck,&#x201d; Bodek muttered.<br><br>The Machine&#x2019;s strategy involved rapidly buying and selling stock options. The trouble: Options tend to be extremely volatile and risky. Because of that, options traders normally offset their positions using stock. If the Machine bought an option giving it the right to buy Apple at a higher price within two weeks, it would turn around and sell short Apple stock to protect the position. If the value of the option to buy Apple declined, Trading Machines would make up some of the losses with the short bet on the stock. It was like an insurance policy against a drop in the value of the option.<br><br>Crunching the data spit out by the options market was an enormous task. In the U.S. options market alone, hundreds of thousands of messages were produced every second. To sort through the data in real time required computer power of the highest order, and intelligent systems to make sense of it.<br><br>Any kink in the strategy could cause it to bleed pennies and nickels. And that&#x2019;s exactly what was happening to Trading Machines&#x2019; stock trades.<br><br>Bodek flinched. Over the years, he&#x2019;d developed a second sense for when the market was about to make a move. He could feel a shift coming.<br><br>In a flash, the Spyder ticked down a few cents to $112. The move was so fast the human eye couldn&#x2019;t see it. A person looking at a screen would see a blur, a wiggle at the edge of motion, but it would seem as if nothing had happened.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Ecuador &amp; the Galapagos Islands (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>#1 best-selling guide to Ecuador &amp; the Galapagos Islands* </i></p><p><b>Lonely Planet Ecuador &amp; the Galapagos Islands </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

He lives in Oxford, England.<b>PREFACE</b><br><br>One of the deepest mysteries of our universe is the puzzle of whence it came.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I entered Cambridge University as a mathematics graduate student, in the early 1950s, a fascinating cosmological theory was in the ascendant, known as the steady-state model. According to this scheme, the universe had no beginning, and it remained more-or-less the same, overall, for all time. The steady-state universe was able to achieve this, despite its expansion, because the continual depletion of material arising from the universe&#x2019;s expansion is taken to be compensated by the continual creation of new material, in the form of an extremely diffuse hydrogen gas. My friend and mentor at Cambridge, the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, from whom I learnt the thrill of so much new physics, was at that time a strong proponent of steady-state cosmology, and he impressed upon me the beauty and power of that remarkable scheme of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet this theory has not stood the test of time. About 10 years after I had first entered Cambridge, and had become well acquainted with the theory, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered, to their own surprise, an all-pervading electromagnetic radiation, coming in from all directions, now referred to as the cosmic microwave background or CMB. This was soon identified, by Robert Dicke, as a predicted implication of the &#x2018;flash&#x2019; of a Big-Bang origin to the universe, now presumed to have taken place some 14 thousand million years ago&#x2014;an event that had been first seriously envisaged by Monsignor Georges Lema�tre in 1927, as an implication of his work on Einstein&#x2019;s 1915 equations of general relativity and early observational indications of an expansion of the universe. With great courage and scientific honesty (when the CMB data became better established), Dennis Sciama publicly repudiated his earlier views and strongly supported the idea of the Big Bang origin to the universe from then on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since that time, cosmology has matured from a speculative pursuit into an exact science, and intense analysis of the CMB&#x2014;coming from highly detailed data, generated by numerous superb experiments&#x2014;has formed a major part of this revolution. However, many mysteries remain, and much speculation continues to be part of this endeavour. In this book, I provide descriptions not only of the main models of classical relativistic cosmology but also of various developments and puzzling issues that have arisen since then. Most particularly, there is a profound oddness underlying the Second Law of thermodynamics and the very nature of the Big Bang. In relation to this, I am putting forward a body of speculation of my own, which brings together many strands of different aspects of the universe we know.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own unorthodox approach dates from the summer of 2005, though much of the detail is more recent. This account goes seriously into some of the geometry, but I have refrained from including, in the main body of the text, anything serious in the way of equations or other technicalities, all these being banished to the Appendices. The experts, only, are referred to those parts of the book. The scheme that I am now arguing for here is indeed unorthodox, yet it is based on geometrical and physical ideas which are very soundly based. Although something entirely different, this proposal turns out to have strong echoes of the old steady-state model!<br> &nbsp;<br> I wonder what Dennis Sciama would have made of it.</p><h2>Evidence of Things Unseen : A Novel</h2><p>Falling in love during the Second World War, a soldier and a glassblower&#39;s daughter eventually have a son, who in adulthood finds his own love affair impacted by fallout of the atomic age. 35,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Marianne Wiggins</b> is the author of seven books of fiction including <i>John Dollar</i> and <i>Evidence of Things Unseen.</i> She has won an NEA grant, the Whiting Writers' Award, and the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, and she was a National Book Award finalist in fiction for <i>Evidence of Things Unseen.</i><p><b>Chapter One: <i>Radiance</i></b> </p><p> On the night that they found Lightfoot, the stars were falling down. </p><p> All along the pirate coast the lighthouse keepers cast their practiced eyes into the night, raking dark infinity with expectant scrutiny the way the lighthouse beams combed cones of light over the tillered sea. </p><p> Over the Outer Banks, from the eastern constellation Perseus, shooting stars like packet seeds spilled across the sky, tracing transits of escape above the fourteen lighthouses from Kitty Hawk and Bodie Light to Hatteras and Lookout. </p><p> It was the yearly August meteor shower and Fos had driven out from Tennessee across the Smokies to the brink of the Atlantic for the celestial show as he'd done each August for the last fifteen years ever since he'd shipped home from France in '19, once the War was over. He and fifteen other sons from Dare County had been among the first recruits to go across the North Atlantic in '18 for valor, decency, and hell like they'd never known. Not one among them who survived was proud of it in any way that didn't cast a shadow back across his pride. Fos himself, by accident, had been a sparker in the field, an incendiary artist, and he'd been brilliant at it. He'd always had an interest in what made things light up, made things radiate, but he never knew he had a latent genius like a fuse, a flare for fireworks, until they handed him a uniform and stood him up in front of a regimental officer and asked him what, if anything, he was good at doing. I'm good at making things light up, Fos said. Looking at the open file on the camp table between them, Fos watched the R.O.'s pen stall where Fos's name was written on the page. You mean explosives? the R.O. said. </p><p> -- um no sir. </p><p> The pen still stalled. </p><p> -- chemicals? the R.O. pressed. </p><p> -- <i>radiance,</i> Fos explained. </p><p> They put him in Artillery and shipped him over with the rest of the First Army and on the fifth day in their training camp in France two British officers with more brass than a church organ between them in-terrupted gun assembly in his barracks. Who's the chap here who's the chemist? the one with more brass asked. When no one volunteered, the one with less brass held his clipboard up and read out, Private First Class Foster? Fos felt the heat rise to his cheeks and took a weak step forward. </p><p> -- that would be me, sir. </p><p> Come with us. </p><p> They led Fos past rows of wooden barracks to the quartermaster's depot into the munition stores. Next to a stepped-temple of stacked diesel drums there was a brick hut with a flat roof, buttressed by sandbags. Inside there were four men in blue smocks and gauze surgical masks in a makeshift laboratory. An astringent tinge of sulfur in the air was the first thing that Fos noticed. Speak any French? the British officer asked before he left him there. </p><p> -- no sir. </p><p> -- learn to. </p><p> -- yes sir. </p><p> Four pairs of dark wide eyes stared at Fos above the surgical masks. Then one of the men, the short one in the foreground, spoke. A patch of moisture appeared on his mask from where the words emanated and Fos stared at it, uncomprehending, as if a translation would materialize there as well. The tallest of the four untied his own mask and, with a heavy accent, said, He wants to know are you the candlemaker Uncle Sam has sent? </p><p> -- <i>candlemaker?</i> </p><p> Fos stared at the material around them. There were shelves of chemicals in jars, sieves and grinders, meshes, funnels, fuses of all sorts, crates of French F 1 pineapple grenade casings. As best as Fos could reckon from the things that he could recognize, the men in the blue smocks were making firecrackers. The short man gave an impatient shrug and seemed to ask the same question again, only this time with more force so his mask made little jumps, in and out, like a pumping artery. Fos nodded, mutely, and then there were <i>oos</i> and <i>ahs</i> all around and then the short one asked him something else in a nicer way with what appeared to be a little curtsy. He wants to know where in the United States we come from? the tall man translated for Fos. </p><p> Oh, Fos answered. North Carolina. </p><p> They stared at him. </p><p> Kitty Hawk, he said. </p><p> -- <i>kiti</i> -- ? the short one repeated. </p><p> Kitty <i>Hawk,</i> Fos emphasized. He flapped his arms. <i>The Wright brothers,</i> he said. </p><p> There was a burst of recognition as all of them flapped their arms and chimed Or-<i>vee!</i> Wil-<i>bear!</i> That established, everyone turned back to what he had been doing and left Fos in the care of the tallest one among them, the one who spoke the English, a French-Canadian, as it turned out, who handed Fos a mask and smock and began to show him around the little laboratory. </p><p> <i>You wouldn't think it,</i> Fos would later tell his son Lightfoot, <i>but the worst of problems over there was Light, pure and simple.</i> Daylight. 'Cause there wasn't hardly ever any of it. Almost none. You would have thought the vermin and the brute of noise would have been the worst, but men go crazy without daylight. In the smoke and in the dark. Men go crazy when they have to run out into somethin that might kill them that they can't see right in front of 'em. </p><p> So Fos's first job in the Great War was to learn from four Frenchmen, who'd had three years' more experience, how to light the trenches, how to light the field. So that the boys could see what they were shooting at. See death coming, when it came. </p><p> <i>Sodium nitrate, Lead tetraoxide, Potassium chlorate,</i> the Canadian recited to Fos from the labels on the bottles on the shelves. Oxidizers, he explained. Hot. <i>Vurry</i> hot, he emphasized. Then he pointed to another group of chemicals and read, <i>Charcoal, Lampblack, Titanium</i> and told Fos, Make the <i>boum.</i> You understand? Fos nodded. All the labels, except the ones for casings and the fuses, were printed in English -- all the warnings were, too -- and Fos comprehended that all these chemicals must have been delivered from the States, or from England. Somewhere where the native lingo produced disclaimers written in English that warned FLAMMABLE SOLID. SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTIBLE. DANGEROUS WHEN WET. The Canadian took down a jar and shook out a salting of powder on a glass slide and said, Paris <i>green.</i> Is copper. Makes the fire burn in blue. Blue flare. </p><p> Behind them, one of the Frenchmen nodded over his work and translated, <i>La flamb�e.</i> </p><p> -- <i>la fus�e,</i> another said. </p><p> -- <i>la flamme vacillante,</i> and Fos was reminded of a drawing he'd once seen of medieval monks at their tables, brushing color onto pages of gospels, while chanting. </p><p> <i>Barium chloride,</i> the Canadian told him. For the green flame. <i>Barium sulphate. </i>All the bariums, green. <i>Sulfur</i> -- yellow. For white, pure white flare -- the magnesiums. <i>Vurry explosif!</i> </p><p> -- <i>foum!</i> one of the Frenchmen mimed. </p><p> -- ker-<i>plouie!</i> another one joked. </p><p> But Fos was transfixed by something else. He wasn't a chemist. He wasn't transported by processes that needed to burn oxygen. He wasn't interested in energy that <i>burned</i>. One of the Frenchmen at a small desk at the back of the lab had a glass vial and a paintbrush in his hands and he was painting a sign on a sheet of metal with a liquid that appeared to be water. </p><p> But in the dark, Fos knew, that liquid would <i>glow.</i> </p><p> -- rah-<i>dyoom,</i> the Canadian said. </p><p> I <i>know,</i> uttered Fos. </p><p> He was impressed. </p><p> A gram of radium these days, he reckoned, must cost a fortune. Tens of thousands of dollars. </p><p> -- <i>caviar,</i> Fos said, searching his English for some way to express to the Frenchman that he knew the stuff's value. </p><p> Above his mask, the Frenchman's eyebrows went up and he pulled his fingertips together and gestured at his mouth and said, <i>Mais il faut qu'on ne le mange pas!</i> </p><p> -- he says Don't eat it, the Canadian said. </p><p> -- <i>don't worry!</i> said Fos. He knew about radium, about radium's effects on humans. Ever since he'd first seen the light that nature can make without burning air, seen his first vision of bioluminescent plankton in the waters off the Outer Banks, Fos had been fascinated by the kinds of lights nature can produce, the ones not always visible to man, the range of lights radiating just off the edge of human vision at the boundaries of the human spectrum. Infrareds and ultraviolets. Colors only birds can see, in their mating rituals, in the feathers of prospective mates. Or colors only underwater animals can see in the ocean's depth beneath the reach of solar light. x-rays, for example. x-rays fascinated Fos. First time he saw an x-ray image in a magazine when he was still a boy, it captured his attention, totally. He stared at it the way a person stares into an icon during prayer. It was an x-ray of a human leg. You could tell it was a left leg from the way the foot bones were arranged. There was something ghostly in them, Fos thought -- in the bones. There was something spectral in the picture. As if the image, in and of itself, possessed a soul. Or captured one. He tore it out and carried it inside his billfold, kept it hidden in his pocket for luck, for prayer, for the same reason someone else would keep a rabbit's foot. Subsequently, he made a point of reading everything he could about the subject -- how x-rays are made, how they'd been discovered, who invented the photographic process of fixing them to film. When he was only twelve he wrote off to one Dr. George Johnson of Boston, President of the American Roentgen Ray Society, to inquire how he could become a member of their august scientific circle. Roentgen, for whom the Society had been named, had "discovered" rays emanating from a cathode-ray tube in 1895, five years after Fos was born. One year after that the Frenchman Becquerel noticed energetic radiation emanating from a uranium salt when they'd fogged a photographic plate that he'd placed next to it by accident. Two years later Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium -- a new element -- in uranium ore. The radium, itself, owned the capacity to <i>glow.</i> Soon after the Curies' discovery, Becquerel went to visit them at their Paris laboratory and asked if he could take a sample of their new element home with him for experiment. They gave him a phial of liquid radium which Becquerel placed in his waistcoat pocket next to his pocket watch. By the time he undressed that night, six hours later, the radium had burned an outline of the phial onto the surface of his skin through three layers of clothing and had irradiated the numbers on his pocket watch so he could read them in the dark. In other words: they glowed. </p><p> Soon before he joined up to go to War, Fos had read that a watch factory in Salem, North Carolina, had closed down because a dozen factory workers, watchface painters, had developed a mysterious bone disease, necrosis of the jawbone, and subsequently died. What the article in the local paper hadn't said was why only the painters at the watch factory had fallen ill. But Fos had guessed the reason. Working on a field that small, painting lines the livelong day on a circle half the size of a silver dollar, the watch painters had a built-in opportunity to attract hazard to their bones, especially if the paint contained pure radium. No doubt for precision and to perfect their points, every quarter hour -- maybe even every minute-on-the-minute -- the painters must have licked their brushes. So Fos understood the culinary subtleties the Frenchman had referred to when he said, Don't eat it. Fos was never one for insubordination but the truth was until he saw the radium he'd been thinking he should come clean to the Canadian and tell him to tell the Frenchmen that there'd been a regimental error and they'd recruited the wrong guy. It would have been a stupid thing to do, Fos knew. Even in so short a time as he'd been in France he'd heard the horror stories about what they could expect once they moved into the frontline trenches. At least if he played along here with the Frenchies he might reasonably expect to stay <i>behind</i> the front. When he thought about it he knew he was better off making flares and staying under cover than strapping his gas mask on, arming His Trusty with its bayonet and hurling his entirety against sure desolation, land mines, and the unknown of that hell between the trenches they called No mans land. Still, until he saw the radium Fos wasn't keen on simply playing out his Army time setting loose a load of chemistry into French heaven. But when he saw the radium he knew at once there was before him something he had dreamed of: Chance of a lifetime. It wasn't the last time nature's active miracles would offer Fos A Chance, but they weren't always as self-evident as that one was. That one was a beaut -- the first step in a chain reaction of events that soon had Fos sharing a cramped space dubbed the Boom Bunker in the trenches on the American Line southwest of Verdun outside the town of St. Mihiel with an intense fella from Tennessee they called "Flash" Handy who would ultimately change Fos's life. Flash was the regimental photographer and he and Fos were the only boys -- other than the mustard gas and chlorine boys in the Chem Corps -- who were supplied with active chemicals on the front line. Fos had all the oxidizers, neons, burn reducers, phosphorescents, and fluorescents he needed to create a Light at the end of every tunnel for the doughboys in their darkest hours: Flash had the acid baths, developers, gum-bichromates and platinum and silver powders for his photographs. If the Jerries had ever landed a live one on them Flash and Fos had enough volatility in store to take the whole American Expeditionary Force one way to the moon. Fos, himself, took a nasty dose of mustard gas on the September morning the First Army made their raid on St. Mihiel, and after that his eyes watered continuously. He couldn't see without his specs in daylight, but his night vision stayed the same as it had always been -- and it had always been near superhuman. It was legendary, all the things that Fos could see that others couldn't in the dark. Which meant that not only was he indispensible on night maneuvers in the field but he was also an enlightened wizard in the darkroom -- a fact which Flash was quick to grasp. Fos could make a photographic print with such resulting subtle nuance and precision it seemed the image that emerged onto the photographic paper had been bled from Fos's hands. When the armistice was called on November 11, Flash's unit was dispatched to Rouen for the Occupation, while Fos's went to Metz, and the two of them were forced to go their separate ways. But when Fos returned to Kitty Hawk in the late winter of '19, Flash offered him a partnership in his studio in Knoxville, Tennessee. Fos packed his x-ray books and tide charts into his Army footlocker and drove his old Ford truck away from the Atlantic Coast on the hottest August morning of that year on record. For as long as anyone could remember, Fos's people had been lightermen in and around the shoals and hoaxing sands of the Outer Banks -- conveyancers of cargo in scoop-hulled longboats called <i>lighters</i> in those waters -- unt...</p></p><h2>Get Even: The Complete Book Of Dirty Tricks</h2><p>A hilarious overview of the methods people use to get even with big business, government and enemies.

He sent it to what seemed like every publisher in England before it was finally accepted by a small firm called Ward, Lock &amp; Co. He was paid a one-time sum of �25, relinquishing all other rights to the publisher. The company thought it would be most effective in one of its big holiday issues, <i>Beeton&#x2019;s Christmas Annual</i>, so Conan Doyle had to wait nearly a year before seeing it in print in December 1887. Thus after this long and uncertain gestation the world finally saw the birth of the resplendent career of the character who would become the greatest literary detective, Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conan Doyle got the idea for a detective story from the acknowledged creators of the genre. Edgar Allan Poe had written three short stories featuring Parisian sleuth C. Auguste Dupin: Murders in the Rue Morgue,&#x201d; The Mystery of Marie Rog�t,&#x201d; and The Purloined Letter.&#x201d; Conan Doyle lifted so much detail from Poe that he seemed a plagiarist to some. He took several key components from Dupin. Holmes, like Dupin, is a prodigious pipe smoker. He also places ads in the newspaper to lure the perpetrator of the crime to his apartment. He goes to the scene of the crime to find clues the police had overlooked. Yet another component borrowed from Dupin was his trick of breaking in on his companion&#x2019;s thought process by guessing the links in his train of thought. Ironically, Holmes complains in this first story that this habit of Dupin annoys him, but apparently not as much as he claims, as he adopts it himself in two later stories. Most important, like Poe, Conan Doyle decided to give his detective a companion to narrate the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Such a narrator provides several advantages. He can frame the story more dramatically than the detective could because the companion is in the dark about the outcome. He therefore can sustain suspense and share his surprise with us when the mystery is solved. The narrator also has the freedom to glorify his friend, something the detective as narrator couldn&#x2019;t do for himself without suffering the inevitable backlash from readers who don&#x2019;t usually take kindly to braggarts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conan Doyle also borrowed from the work of �mile Gaboriau, a Frenchman who wrote the first police novels. His Inspector Lecoq uses scientific methods to build a solid case against the criminal piece by piece. Holmes&#x2019;s scientific method owes the most to this source. Gaboriau also divides his novels into two equal parts, with flashbacks to prior action, a device Conan Doyle copied in the first two Holmes novels. Conan Doyle based Holmes&#x2019;s deductive process lightning quick and seemingly intuitive, though informed by careful observation of detail and mountains of precise knowledge on Conan Doyle&#x2019;s teacher at the medical school at Edinburgh, Dr. Joseph Bell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once embarked on the process of stirring all these ingredients together, Conan Doyle had to choose a name for his detective. The first he chose was J. Sherrinford Holmes, then Sherrington Hope, and finally the one we know today. We don&#x2019;t know where he got the name Sherlock, but we can be sure that the last name was a tribute to Oliver Wendell Holmes, the American physician and author, father of the great U.S. Supreme Court justice of the same name. Conan Doyle had read and greatly admired his work, saying of him, Never have I so known and loved a man whom I had never seen.&#x201d; On his first trip to America Conan Doyle made a reverential visit to the author&#x2019;s grave.</p><p><i></i>&nbsp;</p><i>A Study in Scarlet</i> introduces the formula that almost all the other Holmes stories will follow. Someone seeks out the detective at his Baker Street rooms to solve an unusual mystery. Holmes and Watson then set out to explore the scene of the mystery. The police are often involved, but of course they never have a clue. After an adventure or two that builds suspense, Holmes solves the case in the most dramatic way. The two investigators end up back at Baker Street, where Holmes explains any point in his chain of reasoning that might have escaped Watson&#x2019;s understanding, and all&#x2019;s once again right with the world. Doyle varies this formula in minor ways in a few of the stories in this first volume, but not often. (He will cleverly foil our expectations of this pattern in later stories.) This plot repetition, which might seem a weakness, turns out to be a strength. It contributes to that sense of solidness we get from this world in which logic triumphs over superstition, and where justice in one form or another is meted out to violators of the social order. The sense of order that runs through this world is one of the great satisfactions of these stories. No matter how bizarre the circumstances, Holmes will tender a rational explanation for everything. Criminals are caught not because they make a fatal error, but because all human actions, good and bad, leave traces behind. If you pay close enough attention to the causative chain of events in everyday life, and you&#x2019;ve trained yourself to think logically, you&#x2019;ll be able to follow that chain when someone has committed a crime.</p><h2>The Limit: Life and Death on the 1961 Grand Prix Circuit</h2><p>In THE LIMIT, Michael Cannell tells the enthralling story of Phil Hill-a lowly California mechanic who would become the first American-born driver to win the Grand Prix-and, on the fiftieth anniversary of his triumph, brings to life a vanished world of glamour, valor, and daring. With the pacing and vivid description of a novel, THE LIMIT charts the journey that brought Hill from dusty California lots racing midget cars into the ranks of a singular breed of men, competing with daredevils for glory on Grand Prix tracks across Europe. Facing death at every turn, these men rounded circuits at well over 150 mph in an era before seat belts or roll bars-an era when drivers were &#34;crushed, burned, and beheaded with unnerving regularity.</p><p><br> <b>Photos from <i>The Limit</i></b> <br> <b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br>Phil Hill and Wolfgang von Trips share the laurel wreath after von Trips finished first and Hill second at the 1961 Dutch Grand Prix.

They believed that in any given car, on any given turn, they could go only so fast before their tires lost adhesion to the road and the car spun or flipped. Their great challenge was to identify that perimeter of speed--the limit--and stay close to it for as long as possible without surpassing it. Racing amounted to a deadly game of brinksmanship. In their desperation to win, some drivers knowingly exceeded the limit, often with fatal results. </p> <p>Drivers measured their proximity to the limit in tenths. A team manager might order them to practice at no more eight-tenths of the limit, meaning fast but not reckless. If they accelerated to nine-tenths they pushed the edge of control. At ten tenths they were on the limit, where even the most stoic drivers trembled and sweated. And with good reason. There was a lot more at stake in the days before seatbelts and rollbars. </p> <p><strong>What drew you to this chapter of Grand Prix history?</strong></p> <p>My absorption began with photographs. I was working as an editor at <em>The New York Times</em> five years ago when I saw a book by Robert Daley, a former <em>Times</em> correspondent who covered the Grand Prix in the 1950s. The circuit of that era was preposterously glamorous, like <em>La Dolce Vita</em> with car fumes. Many drivers came from prominent European families. Wives and groupies sat in the pits wearing Capri pants and tight cashmere sweaters. But the glamour was closely accompanied by a dark aspect. The sport was dangerous to a degree that seems unthinkable today. For example, in 1955 a Mercedes sports car somersaulted into the grandstand at Le Mans, killing more than 80 spectators. The organizers didn&#x2019;t even stop the race. </p> <p>The photographs express the range of emotions, from giddy to heartache. First I was seduced, then obsessed. It wasn&#x2019;t very long before I stumbled on the rivalry at the heart of my story. I remember thinking, "This is a story that needs to be told." </p> <p><strong>Nineteen sixty-one was a glamorous time, made popular recently with the success of <em>Mad Men</em>. How does Grand Prix racing fit into the mystique of the early 1960s?</strong></p> <p>Like <em>Mad Men</em>, <em>The Limit</em> shines with mid-century optimism but one senses an undercurrent of dread. The drivers played poker in first-class cabins of Alitalia flights. They danced at El Morocco in New York and drank in Havana dives. All the while they knew that at least a handful of their companions would die by season&#x2019;s end. </p> <p><strong>Who is Phil Hill? Why do you think his remarkable story is not well known today?</strong></p> <p>Phil Hill is the greatest champion you&#x2019;ve never heard of. He was a Santa Monica mechanic and hot rodder who worked his way up the dusty ranks of California oval racing and, implausibly enough, joined the Ferrari team in 1956. At first he drove sports cars, then forced his way into Grand Prix where he managed to win, and win consistently, as his friends and teammates died around him. When he wasn&#x2019;t on the victory podium he was attending funerals. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of his championship season. </p> <p>Hill never received much recognition, in part because he didn&#x2019;t seem like a champion. He was often too anxious to digest solid food. As a result, he traveled with boxes of baby food. In the hours before a race he paced the pits, smoking and compulsively polishing his goggles. A correspondent called him "Hamlet with goggles and gloves." </p> <p><strong>At its core, <em>The Limit</em> can be seen as an unlikely love story. How does that occur?</strong></p> <p>Phil Hill&#x2019;s parents were abusive alcoholics. He gravitated to car mechanics as an escape to an ordered world, a reassuring realm where every action had a predictable reaction. As a driver he kept his distance from women. He did not want relationship issues clouding his mind while he drove at 170 mph, and he considered it unfair to wed while engaged in a dangerous sport. In truth, I don&#x2019;t think he every expected to marry. The impression of family life left by his parents was too distasteful. He attended their funerals, and the funerals of dozens of drivers, with steely restraint. He had always lived in a state of cold detachment, which served him well as a racer, but not as a person. But at age 44 he wed Alma Svendsen, a spirited blonde teacher. They had met when she visited his house with some students. She unlocked something in him. For the first time, he unclenched and opened himself to the prospect of love and family. He became an entirely different person. </p> <p><strong>Hill&#x2019;s main competition for the 1961 Grand Prix title was fellow teammate German Count Wolfgang von Trips. What can you tell me about him?How was his style different than Hill&#x2019;s?</strong></p> <p>Like all great sports stories, this was a pairing of opposites. Hill and von Trips were teammates and friends, but they differed in every imaginable way. Hill was a California mechanic; von Trips was a German nobleman raised in a moated castle. Hill had an uncanny understanding of the car&#x2019;s mechanical life; von Trips cared little about what lay under the hood. Von Trips may not have grasped the engineering subtleties, as Hill did, but he had something arguably more valuable: an instinctive mastery of speed and cat-quick reflexes. To put it another way: Hill drove with his head, von Trips drove with his nerves. </p> <p>For all their differences, the two men shared something fundamental: Each came to racing from traumatic upbringings. Hill&#x2019;s parents were alcoholics. Von Trips was a teen when Nazi Germany collapsed. As a member of the Hitler Youth, he was recruited to pull bodies from the rubble. He was determined to be the smiling, handsome face of a new Germany. </p> <p><strong>Enzo Ferrari is an enigmatic figure who in many ways is at the heart of <em>The Limit</em>. What kind of hold did he have on the drivers on the Ferrari team? Why did the drivers put up with it?</strong></p> <p>Enzo Ferrari resembled a James Bond villain. He was rarely seen without dark glasses, even in restaurants. He was a shadowy, enigmatic figure who bullied and manipulated the drivers. He had a genius for recognizing a person&#x2019;s weakness, and he was not afraid to exploit it. </p> <p>The defining event of Enzo Ferrari&#x2019;s life was the death of his son Dino of muscular dystrophy at age 24. Every morning he went to Dino&#x2019;s tomb and spoke aloud to him, as if they were seated at lunch. Every time a driver died he relived the trauma and mourning. And yet he deliberately put his drivers at particular risk by pitting them against each other. He believed that an insecure driver was a fast driver. The drivers stomached it all for a chance to drive the fastest cars in the world. "With Ferrari you not have to worry," a Ferrari manager told Phil Hill. "You get in. You drive. You win." </p> <p><strong>Formula 1 racing was such a deadly sport in this era.What changes in the sport--technological and otherwise--happened during Hill&#x2019;s tenure and shortly thereafter?</strong></p> <p>Today we live in a safety-conscious culture. It&#x2019;s hard to fathom the dangers routinely faced by drivers in the late 1950s. They drove without flameproof coveralls and roll bars. Their helmets were flimsy cork constructions. Believe it or not, they did without seat belts; the drivers wanted to be unconstrained to leap from the car if necessary. Worst of all, they often raced with brakes so depleted that they would hardly have stopped a bicycle. All of that changed after Hill&#x2019;s retirement in 1967. Within a few years racing became much safer with the introduction of crash barriers, seat belts and the cockpits designed for quick evacuation. </p> <p><strong>The Grand Prix circuit took drivers all over the world, making it a truly global sport the way soccer is today. What is the state of Formula 1 racing today?</strong></p> <p>Fifty years ago racing was still in a state of innocence. The cars were painted national racing colors -- red for Italian teams, green for Great Britain, silver for Germany--with no corporate logos to obscure them. Spectators were free to mingle in the pits, snapping photos and chatting with drivers. Everything changed when the races became televised. Media handlers and sponsorship deals inundated the sport, setting it on its course to becoming the formidable industry it is today.</p> <p><strong>After Phil Hill took home the championship, what happened to him? Did he race anymore?</strong></p> <p>The death of Wolfgang von Trips hung like a curse over the Ferrari empire. Eight key managers and engineers walked out before the 1962 season, leaving the Grand Prix team ill-equipped to compete with the resurgent British marques. Hill stayed on for one lackluster season, followed by forgettable stints with other teams. It was a humiliating endgame for a former champion. Shortly before retiring, in 1967, he played an advisory role in the production of <em>Grand Prix</em>, a John Frankenheimer movie partially based on his career. In a case of art imitating life, a main character, played by Yves Montand, spun off the Monza track and died, just as von Trips had five years earlier. Later Hill returned to his first love: the restoration of vintae cars. Then he met Alma, and that changed everything.</p>Michael Cannell has written about sports for the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>New York Times</em> <em>Magazine</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> and <em>Outside</em>, and was editor of the <em>New York Times</em> House &amp; Home section for seven years.

In the case of England's best-known and best-loved modern satirist, that event has been long overdue. </p> <p> Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent Discworld novels satirize and celebrate every aspect of life, modern and ancient, sacred and profane. Consistent number-one bestsellers in England, they have garnered him a secure position in the pantheon of humor along with Mark Twain, Douglas Adams, Matt Groening, and Jonathan Swift. </p><p> Even so distinguished an author as A. S. Byatt has sung his praises, calling Pratchett's intricate and delightful fictional Discworld "more complicated and satisfying than Oz." </p><p> His latest satiric triumph, <em> Carpe Jugulum,</em> involves an exclusive royal snafu that leads to comic mayhem. In a fit of enlightenment democracy and ebullient goodwill, King Verence invites Uberwald's undead, the Magpyrs, into Lancre to celebrate the birth of his daughter. But once ensconced within the castle, these wine-drinking, garlic-eating, sun-loving modern vampires have no intention of leaving. <em> Ever.</em> </p><p> Only an uneasy alliance between a nervous young priest and the argumentative local witches can save the country from being taken over by people with a cultivated bloodlust and bad taste in silk waistcoats. For them, there's only one way to fight. </p><p> Go for the throat, or as the <em> vampyres</em> themselves say...<br> Carpe Jugulum</p></p><p><i>Carpe Jugulum</i> is the 23rd Discworld novel, and with it this durable series continues its juggernaut procession onward. Pratchett is an author who inspires such devotions that his fans will fall on the novel with cries of joy. Nonfans, perhaps, will want to know what all the fuss is about; and that's something difficult to put into a few words. The best thing to do for those completely new to Pratchett is to sample him for themselves, and this novel is as good a place to start as any. But fans have a more precise question. They know that Discworld novels come in one of two varieties: the quite good and the brilliant. So, for instance, where <i>Hogfather</i> and <i>Maskerade</i> were quite good, <i>Feet of Clay</i> and <i>Jingo</i> were brilliant. While true fans wouldn't want to do without the former, they absolutely live for the latter. And with <i>Carpe Jugulum</i>, Pratchett has hit the jackpot again. This novel is one of the brilliant ones. <p> The plot is a version of an earlier Discworld novel, <i>Lords and Ladies</i>, with the predatory elves of that novel being replaced here by suave and deadly vampires, and the tiny kingdom of Lancre being defended by its witches. But plot is the least of Pratchett's appeal, and <i>Carpe Jugulum</i> is loaded with marvelous characters (not least the witches themselves, about whom we learn a deal more), comic touches and scenes of genius, and even some of the renowned down-to-earth Pratchett wisdom (about the inner ethical conflicts we all face and the wrongness of treating people as things). Pratchett's vampires are elegant Bela Lugosi types, and they come up against an unlikely but engaging alliance of witches; blue-skinned pixies like Rob Roy Smurfs; a doubting priest with a boil on his face; and a magical house-size Phoenix in a seamless, completely absorbing, and feel-good-about-the-universe mixture. Highly recommended. <i>--Adam Roberts, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series.

The first few inches happened automatically. But soon I&#x2019;d notice that the higher I got, the more my progress depended on me&#x2014;on what <i>I</i> did. If I got too excited, too swept away by the experience, I would plummet back to the ground . . . hard. But if I played it cool, took it all in stride, then off I would go, faster and faster, up into the starry sky.<br> <br>Maybe those dreams were part of the reason why, as I got older, I fell in love with airplanes and rockets&#x2014;with anything that might get me back up there in the world above this one. When our family flew, my face was pressed flat to the plane&#x2019;s window from takeoff to landing. In the summer of 1968, when I was fourteen, I spent all the money I&#x2019;d earned mowing lawns on a set of sailplane lessons with a guy named Gus Street at Strawberry Hill, a little grass strip &#x201c;airport&#x201d; just west of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the town where I grew up. I still remember the feeling of my heart pounding as I pulled the big cherry-red knob that unhooked the rope connecting me to the towplane and banked my sailplane toward the field. It was the first time I had ever felt truly alone and free. Most of my friends got that feeling in cars, but for my money being a thousand feet up in a sailplane beat that thrill a hundred times over.<br> <br>In college in the 1970s I joined the University of North Carolina sport parachuting (or skydiving) team. It felt like a secret brotherhood&#x2014;a group of people who knew about something special and magical. My first jump was terrifying, and the second even more so. But by my twelfth jump, when I stepped out the door and had to fall for more than a thousand feet before opening my parachute (my first &#x201c;ten second delay&#x201d;), I knew I was home. I made 365 parachute jumps in college and logged more than three and a half hours in free fall, mainly in formations with up to twenty-five fellow jumpers. Although I stopped jumping in 1976, I continued to enjoy vivid dreams about skydiving, which were always pleasant.<br> <br>The best jumps were often late in the afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink beneath the horizon. It&#x2019;s hard to describe the feeling I would get on those jumps: a feeling of getting close to something that I could never quite name but that I knew I had to have more of. It wasn&#x2019;t solitude exactly, because the way we dived actually wasn&#x2019;t all that solitary. We&#x2019;d jump five, six, sometimes ten or twelve people at a time, building free-fall formations. The bigger and the more challenging, the better.<br> <br>One beautiful autumn Saturday in 1975, the rest of the UNC jumpers and I teamed up with some of our friends at a paracenter in eastern North Carolina for some formations. On our penultimate jump of the day, out of a D18 Beechcraft at 10,500 feet, we made a ten-man snowflake. We managed to get ourselves into complete formation before we passed 7,000 feet, and thus were able to enjoy a full eighteen seconds of flying the formation down a clear chasm between two towering cumulus clouds before breaking apart at 3,500 feet and tracking away from each other to open our chutes.<br> <br>By the time we hit the ground, the sun was down. But by hustling into another plane and taking off again quickly, we managed to get back up into the last of the sun&#x2019;s rays and do a second sunset jump. For this one, two junior members were getting their first shot at flying into formation&#x2014;that is, joining it from the outside rather than being the base or pin man (which is easier because your job is essentially to fall straight down while everyone else maneuvers toward you). It was exciting for the two junior members, but also for those of us who were more seasoned, because we were building the team, adding to the experience of jumpers who&#x2019;d later be capable of joining us for even bigger formations.<br> <br>I was to be the last man out in a six-man star attempt above the runways of the small airport just outside Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. The guy directly in front of me was named Chuck. Chuck was fairly experienced at &#x201c;relative work,&#x201d; or RW&#x2014;that is, building free-fall formations. We were still in sunshine at 7,500 feet, but a mile and a half below us the streetlights were blinking on. Twilight jumps were always sublime and this was clearly going to be a beautiful one.<br> <br>Even though I&#x2019;d be exiting the plane a mere second or so behind Chuck, I&#x2019;d have to move fast to catch up with everyone. I&#x2019;d rocket straight down headfirst for the first seven seconds or so. This would make me drop almost 100 miles per hour faster than my friends so that I could be right there with them after they had built the initial formation.<br> <br>Normal procedure for RW jumps was for all jumpers to break apart at 3,500 feet and track away from the formation for maximum separation. Each would then &#x201c;wave off&#x201d; with his arms (signaling imminent deployment of his parachute), turn to look above to make sure no others were above him, then pull the rip cord.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three, two, one . . . go!&#x201d;<br> <br>The first four jumpers exited, then Chuck and I followed close behind. Upside down in a full-head dive and approaching terminal velocity, I smiled as I saw the sun setting for the second time that day. After streaking down to the others, my plan was to slam on the air brakes by throwing out my arms (we had fabric wings from wrists to hips that gave tremendous resistance when fully inflated at high speed) and aiming my jumpsuit&#x2019;s bell-bottomed sleeves and pant legs straight into the oncoming air.<br> <br>But I never had the chance.<br> <br>Plummeting toward the formation, I saw that one of the new guys had come in too fast. Maybe falling rapidly between nearby clouds had him a little spooked&#x2014;it reminded him that he was moving about two hundred feet per second toward that giant planet below, partially shrouded in the gathering darkness. Rather than slowly joining the edge of the formation, he&#x2019;d barreled in and knocked everybody loose. Now all five other jumpers were tumbling out of control.<br> <br>They were also much too close together. A skydiver leaves a super-turbulent stream of low-pressure air behind him. If a jumper gets into that trail, he instantly speeds up and can crash into the person below him. That, in turn, can make both jumpers accelerate and slam into anyone who might be below <i>them</i>. In short, it&#x2019;s a recipe for disaster.<br> <br>I angled my body and tracked away from the group to avoid the tumbling mess. I maneuvered until I was falling right over &#x201c;the spot,&#x201d; a magical point on the ground above which we were to open our parachutes for the leisurely two-minute descent.<br> <br>I looked over and was relieved to see that the disoriented jumpers were now also tracking away from each other, dispersing the deadly clump.<br> <br>Chuck was there among them. To my surprise, he was coming straight in my direction. He stopped directly beneath me. With all of the group&#x2019;s tumbling, we were passing through 2,000 feet elevation more quickly than Chuck had anticipated. Maybe he thought he was lucky and didn&#x2019;t have to follow the rules&#x2014;exactly.<br> <br><i>He must not see me</i>. The thought barely had time to go through my head before Chuck&#x2019;s colorful pilot chute blossomed out of his backpack. His pilot chute caught the 120-mph breeze coming around him and shot straight toward me, pulling his main parachute in its sleeve right behind it.<br> <br>From the instant I saw Chuck&#x2019;s pilot chute emerge, I had a fraction of a second to react. For it would take less than a second to tumble through his deploying main parachute, and&#x2014;quite likely&#x2014;right into Chuck himself. At that speed, if I hit his arm or his leg I would take it right off, dealing myself a fatal blow in the process. If I hit him directly, both our bodies would essentially explode.<br> <br>People say things move more slowly in situations like this, and they&#x2019;re right. My mind watched the action in the microseconds that followed as if it were watching a movie in slow motion.<br> <br>The instant I saw the pilot chute, my arms flew to my sides and I straightened my body into a head dive, bending ever so slightly at the hips. The verticality gave me increased speed, and the bend allowed my body to add first a little, then a blast of horizontal motion as my body became an efficient wing, sending me zipping past Chuck just in front of his colorful blossoming Para-Commander parachute.<br> <br>I passed him going at over 150 miles per hour, or 220 feet per second. Given that speed, I doubt he saw the expression on my face. But if he had, he would have seen a look of sheer astonishment. Somehow I had reacted in microseconds to a situation that, had I actually had time to think about it, would have been much too complex for me to deal with.<br> <br>And yet . . . I <i>had</i> dealt with it, and we both landed safely. It was as if, presented with a situation that required more than its usual ability to respond, my brain had become, for a moment, superpowered.<br> <br>How had I done it? Over the course of my twenty-plus-year career in academic neurosurgery&#x2014;of studying the brain, observing how it works, and operating on it&#x2014;I have had plenty of opportunities to ponder this very question. I finally chalked it up to the fact that the brain is truly an extraordinary device: more extraordinary than we can even guess.<br> <br>I realize now that the real answer to that question is much more profound. But I had to go through a complete metamorphosis of my life and worldview to glimpse that answer. This book is about the events that changed my mind on the matter. They convinced me that, as marvelous a mechanism as the brain is, it was not my brain that saved my life that day at all. What sprang into action the second Chuck&#x2019;s chute started to open was another, much deeper part of me. A part that could move so fast because it was not stuck in time at all, the way the brain and body are.<br> <br>This was the same part of me, in fact, that had made me so homesick for the skies as a kid. It&#x2019;s not only the smartest part of us, but the deepest part as well, yet for most of my adult life I was unable to believe in it.<br> <br>But I do believe now, and the pages that follow will tell you why.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a neurosurgeon.<br> <br>I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976 with a major in chemistry and earned my M.D. at Duke University Medical School in 1980. During my eleven years of medical school and residency training at Duke as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, I focused on neuroendocrinology, the study of the interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine system&#x2014;the series of glands that release the hormones that direct most of your body&#x2019;s activities. I also spent two of those eleven years investigating how blood vessels in one area of the brain react pathologically when there is bleeding into it from an aneurysm&#x2014;a syndrome known as cerebral vasospasm.<br> <br>After completing a fellowship in cerebrovascular neurosurgery in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom, I spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an associate professor of surgery, with a specialization in neurosurgery. During those years I operated on countless patients, many of them with severe, life-threatening brain conditions.<br> <br>Most of my research work involved the development of advanced technical procedures like stereotactic radiosurgery, a technique that allows surgeons to precisely guide beams of radiation to specific targets deep in the brain without affecting adjacent areas. I also helped develop magnetic resonance image&#x2013;guided neurosurgical procedures instrumental in repairing hard-to-treat brain conditions like tumors and vascular disorders. During those years I also authored or coauthored more than 150 chapters and papers for peer-reviewed medical journals and presented my findings at more than two hundred medical conferences around the world.<br> <br>In short, I devoted myself to science. Using the tools of modern medicine to help and to heal people, and to learn more about the workings of the human body and brain, was my life&#x2019;s calling. I felt immeasurably lucky to have found it. More important, I had a beautiful wife and two lovely children, and while I was in many ways married to my work, I did not neglect my family, which I considered the other great blessing in my life. On many counts I was a very lucky man, and I knew it.<br> <br>On November 10, 2008, however, at age fifty-four, my luck seemed to run out. I was struck by a rare illness and thrown into a coma for seven days. During that time, my entire neocortex&#x2014;the outer surface of the brain, the part that makes us human&#x2014;was shut down. Inoperative. In essence, absent.<br> <br>When your brain is absent, you are absent, too. As a neurosurgeon, I&#x2019;d heard many stories over the years of people who had strange experiences, usually after suffering cardiac arrest: stories of traveling to mysterious, wonderful landscapes; of talking to dead relatives&#x2014;even of meeting God Himself.<br> <br>Wonderful stuff, no question. But all of it, in my opinion, was pure fantasy. What caused the otherworldly types of experiences that such people so often report? I didn&#x2019;t claim to know, but I did know that they were brain-based. All of consciousness is. If you don&#x2019;t have a working brain, you can&#x2019;t be conscious.<br> <br>This is because the brain is the machine that produces consciousness in the first place. When the machine breaks down, consciousness stops. As vastly complicated and mysterious as the actual mechanics of brain processes are, in essence the matter is as simple as that. Pull the plug and the TV goes dead. The show is over, no matter how much you might have been enjoying it.<br> <br>Or so I would have told you before my own brain crashed.<br> <br>During my coma my brain wasn&#x2019;t working improperly&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t working <i>at all</i>. I now believe that this might have been what was responsible for the depth and intensity of the near-death experience (NDE) that I myself underwent during it. Many of the NDEs reported happen when a person&#x2019;s heart has shut down for a while. In those cases, the neocortex is temporarily inactivated, but generally not too damaged, provided that the flow of oxygenated blood is restored through cardiopulmonary resuscitation or reactivation of cardiac function within four minutes or so. But in my case, the neocortex was out of the picture. I was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed <i>completely free of the limitations of my physical brain</i>.<br> <br>Mine was in some ways a perfect storm of near-death experiences. As a practicing neurosurgeon with decades of research and hands-on work in the operating room behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the <i>implications</i> of what happened to me.<br> <br>Those implications are tremendous beyond description. My experience showed me that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave. More important, it continues under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us and about where the universe itself and all the beings within it are ultimately going.<br> <br>The place I went was real. Real in a way that makes the life we&#x2019;re living here and now completely dreamlike by comparison. This doesn&#x2019;t mean I don&#x2019;t value the life I&#x2019;m living now, however. In fact, I value it more than I ever did before. I do so because I now see it in its true co...</p><h2>Krazy: George Herriman, a Life in Black and White</h2><p><p><strong>A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2017</strong></p><p><strong>WINNER OF THE EISNER AWARD FOR BEST COMICS-RELATED BOOK</strong></p><p><strong>FINALIST FOR THE NBCC AWARD IN BIOGRAPHY </strong></p><p><strong>FINALIST FOR THE PEN/JACQUELINE BOGRAD WELD AWARD FOR BIOGRAPHY</strong></p><p>In the tradition of <em>Schulz and Peanuts</em>, an epic and revelatory biography of Krazy Kat creator George Herriman that explores the turbulent time and place from which he emerged&#x2014;and the deep secret he explored through his art.</p><p>The creator of the greatest comic strip in history finally gets his due&#x2014;in an eye-opening biography that lays bare the truth about his art, his heritage, and his life on America&#x2019;s color line.

Nicknamed &#x201c;The Greek&#x201d; by a fellow cartoonist, owing to his swarthy complexion and curly hair (which he typically kept hidden under a fedora), it wasn&#x2019;t until George Herriman, creator of the perpetually lovestruck Krazy Kat, had been dead for twenty-seven years that a would-be biographer discovered the secret Herriman had guarded all his life. He was the product of a mixed-race marriage, and had, like two generations of Herrimans before him, been able to &#x201c;pass for white.&#x201d; The creator of a comic strip that has been infinitely more influential among cartoonists and intellectuals than it was popular with the American public (the strips only appeared in newspapers for twenty years because newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was such a fan he gave Herriman a lifetime contract; a visitor to Herriman&#x2019;s editor found an office junior sopping up a water leak with original Krazy Kat art), this new biography finally gives Herriman his due and frames him as a visionary whose influence helped shape popular culture for decades after his death. It takes a fresh and knowing look at the cheerfully subversive cartoons involving the put-upon but loving black cat and his white, brick-throwing love/nemesis. In addition, Tisserand provides eye-opening dimension with regard to the scale of Herriman&#x2019;s influence: Michael Chabon, Will Eisner, Charles Schulz, ee cummings and many others credit him with inspiring their work (you may never look at the zigzag on Charlie Brown&#x2019;s t-shirt again without remembering that it was Charles Schulz&#x2019;s tribute to the Navaho designs that recurred in Herriman&#x2019;s work). Ultimately, the reader comes away with a sobering idea of what an exhausting job it must have been for a gentle genius, living on the color line in the first half of twentieth century America, pursuing a career and a point of view that never would have been open to him had his true racial identity been known. <em>&#x2014;Vannessa Cronin, The Amazon Book Review</em><p>In this epic and revelatory biography of <em>Krazy Kat</em> creator George Herriman, the man behind one of the greatest comic strips in history finally gets his due. An eye-opening, finely wrought portrait of a life, <em>Krazy</em> re-creates the turbulent time and place from which Herriman emerged&#x2014;and uncovers the secrets he explored through his art.

And people said they would not last a day and the weather still has not broken. What's more is news of the picket is spreading and more and more women are coming from other parts of the district and some from as far away as<br>Maryland and Virginia. President Wilson felt so sorry for them in the cold that he invited them in for coffee but they refused. They said they would only come in to talk about a federal amendment for the women's right to vote. No coffee! This made me think of Sojourner Truth's words about men who help lift women into carriages and over mud puddles--that of course is the easy part, just like giving them coffee. Giving them the vote is the hard part.</p><p>Grade 4-6-Kat Bowen records her days in Washington, DC, in a diary from her mother. A typical 13-year-old from a well-to-do family, she expresses her dreams and hopes as she recounts her thoughts on school, homework, relationships, parties, and her special bond with her cousin Alma. As the early days of 1917 pass, Kat becomes increasingly aware of the political issues that are prevalent, particularly the inevitable involvement of the U.S. in World War I and women's suffrage. Her physician father is quietly supportive of his wife's activism in the movement, while his brother-in-law, Alma's father, demeans it and forbids the women in his family to participate in any way. Kat soon joins her mother sewing banners and bringing hot bricks for warmth on the picket line. Lasky entwines some of the real characters of the day with her fictional figures. She gives a good overview of the harsh treatment these women endured during their picketing and imprisonment and touches on divorce, the plight of African-American citizens in the South, and President Wilson's disinterest in rights for women. Kat is well developed into a young woman whose exposure to the politics and consequences allow her to mature and decide what true liberty and justice for all really means.

Walls, floor, ceiling. The works. White on white on white and it did nothing for Hopper except make him feel slightly dizzy. Snow blindness in the inner city. Imagine that.<br><br>A whole house that was white, top to bottom, every room, every level. Outside it was a Brooklyn brownstone. Inside it was an art installation. Clutching his glass of red wine by the bowl, Hopper was terrified of spilling even a drop.<br><br>Only rich people could live in a house like this, he thought, because only rich people could afford the army of cleaners it must need to keep it just so. Rich people who thought they were Andy Warhol. Rich people who were friends with Andy Warhol, or at least knew his decorator.<br><br>And they had kids, too. Two of them&#x2014;twins, who, even now, were celebrating with a joint birthday party in the vast kitchen at the rear of the house, a kitchen that opened onto a lush garden surrounded by high walls, an impossible oasis hidden in the spaces between row houses, the greenery somehow surviving the baking summer heat that was turning the rest of New York into a dust bowl. The noise of the party reverberated down the spartan hallway in which Hopper had sought solace, at least for a short while, with his ill-chosen drink.<br><br>He lifted the glass and peered at the contents. Red wine at a kid&#x2019;s birthday party.<br><br>Yes, the Palmers were that kind of people.<br><br>Hopper sighed and took a sip. This wasn&#x2019;t how he had planned to spend the Fourth of July, but he knew he shouldn&#x2019;t judge. The children&#x2014;all thirty of them, nearly the whole of Sara&#x2019;s elementary school class&#x2014;were having a great time, being entertained by a team of professionals hired just for the occasion by the Palmers, and being fed and watered&#x2014;and sugared&#x2014;by a catering crew that were probably being paid more for this one gig than Hopper earned in a whole month.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t just the children who were being entertained. The adults were too. Somewhere down the white hall, through one of the many white doors, the parents&#x2014;minus Hopper&#x2014;were all gathered around a show put on just for them. Some kind of magic act, someone had said. Diane had tried to persuade Hopper to come along&#x2014;had even tried dragging him by one arm&#x2014;but . . . a magic act?<br><br>No, he was fine right where he was. Alone. In the hallway of infinite white. With his wine.<br><br>A roar of laughter came from the kitchen, matched by an almost simultaneous roar from the other end of the hallway. Hopper looked one way, then the other, wondering which act to catch. Then, with a shake of the head as he chided himself for being a party pooper, he headed for the parents. As he opened the door at the end of the hall, he half expected to find beyond a white room with a white grand piano in the center, John Lennon at the keys, Yoko Ono draped over the top.<br><br>What he found was another reception room, one of several within the brownstone, this one perhaps slightly less stark than the rest of the house, the white walls at least broken up by the warm brown of ornate, probably original, bookcases.<br><br>Hopper clicked the door closed behind him and nodded in polite greeting to the other parents standing nearby. They were, Hopper noted, mostly the men, while around the large circular table that occupied most of the room sat the mothers and aunts, their attention fixed on the woman who sat at the &#x201c;head&#x201d; of the table, directly opposite the door. The woman was young and wore a red patterned scarf over her head, and sitting on the table in front of her was nothing but a goddamn crystal ball.<br><br>Hopper&#x2019;s jaw tightened, but he resisted the urge to check his watch. He felt uncomfortable and out of place, apparently the only man present who hadn&#x2019;t taken an invitation to a child&#x2019;s birthday party as an opportunity to dress up. The other fathers were clad mostly in wide-lapel sports jackets in varying earthen shades, with ties to match.<br><br>Ah, yes, the Model T jacket and tie. Any color you like so long as it&#x2019;s brown.<br><br>Suddenly Hopper didn&#x2019;t feel quite so bad in his red plaid shirt and blue jeans. At least he was comfortable. Polyester in this heat was not a wise decision&#x2014;as some of the men around him seemed to have discovered, given the red faces and sheen of sweat on several of them.<br><br>Hopper hid his grin in his wine glass as he drained it, and turned his attention to the scene unfolding in the middle of the room, where Diane sat with the other women&#x2014;most clad in long, flowing cotton dresses that looked a lot more breathable than the men&#x2019;s fashion choices&#x2014;leaning in to listen as the fortune-teller stared into the crystal ball and pretended to read the future of . . . was it Cindy, Tom&#x2019;s mother?<br><br>Hopper had lost track. Suddenly he felt like another glass of wine.<br><br>The fortune-teller droned on. She was younger than Hopper would have expected, although he wasn&#x2019;t really sure what age group fortune-tellers were supposed to be. Weren&#x2019;t they meant to be old women? Not that it mattered&#x2014;this was an act, nothing more.<br><br>Hopper told himself to relax, enjoy the show, stop being such a jerk.<br><br>The round of applause that came next snapped Hopper out of his reverie. He looked around the room, and saw that the women at the table were shuffling themselves along, so the next subject was now sitting opposite the fortune-teller.<br><br>It was Diane. She laughed at something her neighbor said, then glanced over her shoulder. Her eyes lit up when she saw Hopper, and she waved at him to come over.<br><br>With a sheepish look to his fellow fathers, Hopper moved forward to stand behind Diane&#x2019;s chair. His wife held her hand out and he squeezed it, then she looked back up at him with a smile.<br><br>He grinned back. &#x201c;Hey, what are you looking at me for? Madame Mystique here is going to see your future.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, the fortune-teller laughed. She pushed back her scarf a little and looked at Hopper. &#x201c;The past, the present, the future&#x2014;all ways, all paths are open to me!&#x201d; She waved her hands over the crystal ball.<br><br>Diane grinned and, taking a deep breath, straightened in her chair and closed her eyes. She let her breath out slowly through her nose.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Lay it on me.&#x201d;<br><br>The room cheered and the fortune-teller, fighting to hold back her own laughter, rolled her neck and stared intently into the crystal ball, her palms flat on the table either side of it.<br><br>The fortune-teller didn&#x2019;t speak. Hopper watched as her gaze narrowed, her brows knitting together as she appeared to concentrate. There were some murmurs from the back of the room as some of the men lost interest.<br><br>And then&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . Oh!&#x201d;<br><br>The fortune-teller jerked back from the crystal ball. Hopper laid his hand on his wife&#x2019;s shoulder, and felt her hand rest on his.<br><br>The fortune-teller closed her eyes, her features twisted as though she was in pain. Hopper felt Diane&#x2019;s grip tighten around his hand. Hopper started to feel a little uneasy. This was an act, and none of it was real, but something in the room had changed, the lighthearted feeling of fun suddenly evaporating.<br><br>He cleared his throat.<br><br>The fortune-teller opened her eyes and tilted her head as she looked into the crystal.<br><br>&#x201c;I see . . . I see . . .&#x201d; Then she shook her head and closed her eyes, screwing them shut tight. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s . . . darkness. A cloud . . . no, it&#x2019;s like a wave, spreading out, sweeping over . . . sweeping over.&#x201d;<br><br>Diane shifted in her chair and looked up at Hopper.<br><br>&#x201c;Light . . . There&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; The fortune-teller grimaced, like she&#x2019;d just bitten into a lemon. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s . . . No, it&#x2019;s not light, it&#x2019;s an . . . absence. A void. Dark, a cloud, like a wave, coming in, sweeping over . . . over . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The fortune-teller gasped. Diane jumped in fright, along with half of the people in the room.<br><br>Hopper shook his head. &#x201c;Hey, if this is some kind of joke . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The fortune-teller shook her head again, and again, and again. &#x201c;A darkness. There is nothing but darkness, a great cloud, serpent black . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; said Hopper.<br><br>&#x201c;The darkness is coming. A night with no end. A day with no dawn. The day of the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I said that&#x2019;s enough!&#x201d; Hopper thumped the table with his hand. The fortune-teller&#x2019;s eyes snapped open and she gulped a lungful of air. She blinked several times as she looked around the faces in the room, her own expression one of surprise, like she had just woken from a deep sleep.</p><h2>The Deepest Acceptance: Radical Awakening in Ordinary Life</h2><p><p>How can we bring an effortless yes to this moment?

Original.</p><p><i>Night in the Lonesome October</i> is the first book published since the death of author Richard Laymon, and it is ironic that this is among his richest and most atmospheric pieces. <p> Laymon's hero Ed Logan is brimming with anticipation for his second year at Willmington University. He's been missing Holly, whom he fell in love with the previous year. But when Ed returns to campus, Holly doesn't. He receives a letter that destroys his hopes; she has fallen in love with another man and won't be coming back. Virtually destroyed by the news, Ed struggles to study and even to sleep. Leaving his apartment one night for a walk, he finds that he has moved into what might almost be a different world. There are others out on the streets; are they human, these figures who hide in the shadows? Certainly, the prey they seek is marked for a grisly end. Needless to say, Ed becomes involved with these sinister figures, particularly a mystery girl who will change his life.</p><p> The fashion in which Laymon insinuates these otherworldly elements into the otherwise normal world of his hero is brilliantly done, with Ed's distraught emotional state seeming to act as a catalyst. In all the best horror tales, the hero is not just menaced by nameless evil, but becomes inextricably involved with it. That is certainly the case here, and the attention paid to his central character is just as rewarding as the horror set pieces: </p><blockquote> I swept the beam a small distance to the left. Near the far end of its reach, it dimly illuminated a low, squatting circle of men. Hairy, filthy, bloody. All of them looking at us. Chewing. Blood spilling from their mouths....</blockquote> <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i>Richard Laymon took an MA in English Literature from Loyola University, Los Angeles. He worked as a schoolteacher, a librarian and a mystery magazine editor before concentrating on writing full-time.

S. Lewis's life and work, from his boyhood in Belfast, Ireland, where he and his brother created their first imaginary world in an attic hideaway, to Lewis's adult years as a renowned scholar and beloved author.</p><p>Beatrice Gormley was born in Glendale, California andattended Pomona College from which she graduated magnacum laude. She is the author of many popular books foryoung readers. As a writer, she admires the drama of Biblestories and is intrigued by their people. She lives inWestport, Massachusetts.Grade 6 UpAIt is difficult to write about Lewis and not mention his Christianity. Gormley does a good job of focusing on her subject's spiritual life while providing a solid biographical context against which to examine it. His personal relationships, from his troubled one with his father, to his late-in-life marriage to Joy Davidman, are thoroughly explored, both for their import for him as a Christian, and as a writer. Other influences on his work are also discussed. Gormley describes Lewis's relationship with J.R.R. Tolkien, who did not like the "Narnia" books, and with other members of his writers' group, the Inklings, who played integral parts in his life. Quotes from the subject, his family, and friends lend a certain intimacy to the presentation. Pictures of Lewis and those close to him also enhance the book. This title continues what Michael Coren touches upon in The Man Who Created Narnia (Eerdmans, 1996), albeit with a stronger emphasis on Lewis's spirituality. Students looking for more than the basic biography will certainly find it here.ACarol Fazioli, Cardinal Hayes Library, Manhattan College, NY<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Surprise Island (The Boxcar Children #2)</h2><p>Henry, Jessie, Violet and Benny used to live alone in a boxcar.

MacHale</b><br> <p>I'm often asked the question, "Where did you get the inspiration for the Pendragon story?" I wish I had an easy answer, like "It all came to me in a brilliant flash of creativity, fully articulated and ready to go." It didn't. The truth is much more complicated. </p> <p>Bobby's adventure didn't start out as Bobby's adventure. It sprang from multiple ideas about many different things. I always like to write about things that I know. Of course I've never traveled through a flume or battled a quig, but so much of what is contained in the Pendragon story jumps from real life...blown up to fantastical proportions. I've written about things I've done and things I've observed. I had an idea for a story about a bunch of people who became addicted to a video game; a discount store that took control of society; a primitive tribe that discovered a devastating, natural weapon; and a world that was in danger of being wiped out by a tainted food supply. I guess the only "brilliant flash of creativity" came when I decided not to write any single one of these stories, but to string them together as part of one overall saga. Being a TV guy, I realized it was a decision that made it impossible for the story to work on television and too big for movies. That's what brought me to writing books.</p> <p>The question then became, how do I string these together? The answer came pretty quickly. I've always written character-driven adventures about young people. That's what I do. So I created the character of Bobby Pendragon. Unlike most hero stories about young people, I didn't want to go the standard route of making him a loser who somehow finds the hero within. That might work for a single adventure, but it's hard to maintain over ten stories! That would have been a REALLY SLOW character arc. Instead, I made Bobby a guy who had it all going on...and lost it. He became a very real guy who made mistakes and didn't have all the answers. I didn't give him superpowers. In my mind he had to be someone who readers could relate to, so they might think: "What would I do if I were stuck in this situation?" Bobby couldn't wave a magic wand or fly or calculate options at the speed of heat. He acted and reacted the way normal people do. And over the course of the adventure, he grew up. </p> <p>That is the essence of the Pendragon story. A real person dealing with very real and understandable conflicts where, as in life, there aren't always right answers. The trappings may be bigger than life, but the core is very real and relatable, both with character and with story. </p> <p>Maybe the most amazing thing about Bobby's journey is that it worked! Meaning, I outlined all ten stories in the very beginning. I knew the theme and setting of each book, and the major events in Bobby's personal journey from the get-go...and I stuck to it. When The Soldiers of Halla is published, Bobby's journey, and mine, will come to an end. I am thrilled and delighted to say that it all worked out the way I planned it. All it took was a lot of work...and maybe a touch of inspiration.</p> <br><br>D.J. MacHale is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Pendragon series and the Morpheus Road series.

J. Ayer in a fabled debate about the existence of God&nbsp;and the possibility of metaphysics, knew that&nbsp;seminary students were fed a woefully inadequate diet&nbsp;of theses and proofs, and that their familiarity&nbsp;with most of history's great thinkers was reduced&nbsp;to simplistic caricatures. Copleston set out to&nbsp;redress the wrong by writing a complete history of&nbsp;Western philosophy, one crackling with incident and&nbsp;intellectual excitement -- and one that gives full&nbsp;place to each thinker, presenting his thought in a&nbsp;beautifully rounded manner and showing his links&nbsp;to those who went before and to those who came&nbsp;after him. <br><br>The result of Copleston's prodigious labors is a history of philosophy that is unlikely ever to be surpassed. <i>Thought</i> magazine summed up the general agreement among scholars and students alike when it reviewed Copleston's <i>A History of Philosophy</i> as "broad-minded and objective, comprehensive and scholarly, unified and well proportioned... We cannot recommend [it] too highly."</p></p><p>Conceived originally as a serious presentation of the development of philosophy for Catholic seminary students, Frederick Copleston's nine-volume <i>A History Of Philosophy</i> has journeyed far beyond the modest purpose of its author to universal acclaim as the best history of philosophy in English.Frederick Copleston (1907-1994) grew up in England. He was raised in an Anglican home but converted to Catholicism while a student at Marlborough College. He later became a Jesuit and then pursued a career in academia. He studied and lectured at Heythrop College and wrote an eleven-volume <i>History of Philosophy</i>, which is highly respected. He also spent time teaching at Gregorian University in Rome and, after he retired, lectured at Santa Clara University in California. He was appointed a member of the British Academy in 1970. He is famous for debating Betrand Russell over the existence of God in a 1948 BBC broadcast.</p><h2>Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (Gender and Culture)</h2><p>Hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as "one of the most influential texts in gender studies, men's studies and gay studies," this book uncovers the homosocial desire between men, from Restoration comedies to Tennyson's <i>Princess.</i></p><p>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is the author of <i>Tendencies</i>, <i>The Coherence of Gothic Conventions</i>, and <i>Epistemology of the Closet</i>.Universally cited as <i>the</i> text that ignited gay studies.

Color illustrations help you identify plants that are poisonous or have poisonous parts. From the Introduction-The purpose of this work was to locate and experiment with Missouri&#39;s wild edibles. The edibles are arranged by the plant&#39;s flowering color. Each plant has a botanical name attached. The length or season of the flower bloom is listed under &#34;Flowers.&#34; &#34;Habitat&#34; refers to the areas where that particular plant prefers to grow,which gives a clue when trying to locate it. &#34;Location&#34; is a reference to where the plant is commonly found in Missouri. &#34;Collection&#34; tells when the plant is edible or ready to be picked,pinched or dug. My hope is that several of the &#34;Uses&#34; or suggested ways to prepare the wildings will be tried by others. &#34;Caution&#34; is a warning for possible poisonous or rash-producing plants or parts of plants.</p><p></p><h2>The Stormy Petrel</h2><p>Rose Fenemore is taking a break from her Cambridge teaching post in an isolated cottage on the island of Moila. One evening, she is shocked to discover an attractive stranger, Ewen Mackay, in her kitchen, who claims to have grown up in the cottage. She is tempted to believe him, when another man seeks shelter from the storm. John Parsons also rouses Rose&#39;s skepticism...and more tender feelings as well. And as the truth about the two men unfolds, the stormy petrels, fragile elusive birds who fly close to the waves, come to symbolize Rose&#39;s confusion and the mystery of her future....</p><p>Lady Mary Stewart is one of our most successful novelists. Her first novel, MADAM WILL YOU TALK, was published in 1954 and marked the beginning of a long and acclaimed writing career. All her novels have been bestsellers on both sides of the Atlantic.At the end of a trying school term Professor Rose Fenemore needs a retreat. An ad for an &#34;ivory tower&#34; on the remote Scottish island of Moila proves irresistible, and the adventure begins. Talented Isla Blair carries the listener through this captivating tale of mystery and adventure. She captures the Queen&#39;s English of the professor and her brother, the clipped Cornish accent of her prize pupil and the Scottish brogue of the island&#39;s inhabitants. One can almost hear the cry of the seabirds, the lap of the waves and the hush of the soft breeze as Stewart spins another tale, and Blair brings it to life. B.L.W.

Last summer, the gathered heroes had threatened to lift the roof beams with their bloodthirsty boasting, their songs of glory, their promises of victory over the High King&#x2019;s rabble.<br><br>As men so often do, they had proved fiercer talkers than fighters. After an idle, inglorious, and unprofitable few months they had slunk away one by one, leaving a handful of the luckless lurking about the great firepit, its flames guttering as low as the fortunes of Throvenland. Where once the many-columned Forest had thronged with warriors, now it was peopled with shadows. Crowded with disappointments.<br><br>They had lost. And they had not even fought a battle.<br><br>Mother Kyre, of course, saw it differently. &#x201c;We have come to terms, my king,&#x201d; she corrected, nibbling at her meat as primly as an old mare at a hay bale.<br><br>&#x201c;Terms?&#x201d; Skara stabbed furiously at her own uneaten food. &#x201c;My father died to hold Bail&#x2019;s Point, and you&#x2019;ve given its key to Grandmother Wexen without a blow struck. You&#x2019;ve promised the High King&#x2019;s warriors free passage across our land! What do you think &#x2018;lost&#x2019; would look like?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre turned her gaze on Skara with the usual infuriating calmness. &#x201c;Your grandfather dead in his howe, the women of Yaletoft weeping over the corpses of their sons, this hall made ashes and you, princess, wearing a slave&#x2019;s collar shackled to the High King&#x2019;s chair. That is what I think &#x2018;lost&#x2019; would look like. Which is why I say come to terms.&#x201d;<br><br>Stripped of his pride, King Fynn sagged like a sail without a mast. Skara had always thought her grandfather as unconquerable as Father Earth. She could not bear to see him like this. Or perhaps she could not bear to see how childish her belief in him had been.<br><br>She watched him swill down more ale, and belch, and toss his gilded cup aside to be refilled. &#x201c;What do you say, Blue Jenner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In such royal company as this, my king, as little as I can.&#x201d;<br><br>Blue Jenner was a shifty old beggar, more raider than trader, his face as crudely chiseled, weathered and cracked as an old prow-beast. Had Skara been in charge he would not have been allowed on her docks, let alone at her high table.<br><br>Mother Kyre, of course, saw it differently. &#x201c;A captain is like a king, but of a ship rather than a country. Your experience might benefit Princess Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>The indignity of it. &#x201c;A lesson in politics from a pirate,&#x201d; Skara muttered to herself, &#x201c;and not even a successful one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mumble. How many hours have I spent teaching you the proper way for a princess to speak? For a queen to speak?&#x201d; Mother Kyre raised her chin and made her voice echo effortlessly from the rafters. &#x201c;If you judge your thoughts worth hearing, pronounce them proudly, push them to every corner of the chamber, fill the hall with your hopes and desires and make every listener share them! If you are ashamed of your thoughts, better to leave a silence. A smile costs nothing. You were saying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; Blue Jenner scratched at the few gray hairs still clinging to his weather-spotted scalp, evidently a place unknown to combs. &#x201c;Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s crushed the rebellion in the Lowlands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With the help of this dog of hers, Bright Yilling, who worships no god but Death.&#x201d; Skara&#x2019;s grandfather snatched up his cup while the thrall was still pouring, ale spilling across the table. &#x201c;They say he lined the road to Skekenhouse with hanged men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The High King&#x2019;s eyes turn north,&#x201d; Jenner went on. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s keen to bring Uthil and Grom-gil-Gorm to heel and Throvenland . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is in the way,&#x201d; finished Mother Kyre. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t slouch, Skara, it is unseemly.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara scowled, but she wriggled her shoulders up the chair a little anyway, closer to the board-stiff, neck-stretched, horribly unnatural pose the minister approved of. Sit as if you have a knife to your throat, she always said. The role of a princess is not to be comfortable.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a man used to living free, and I&#x2019;m no lover of Grandmother Wexen, or her One God, or her taxes, or her rules.&#x201d; Blue Jenner rubbed mournfully at his lopsided jaw. &#x201c;But when Mother Sea whips up the storm, a captain does what he must to save what he can. Freedom&#x2019;s worth nothing to the dead. Pride&#x2019;s worth little even to the living.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wise words.&#x201d; Mother Kyre wagged her finger at Skara. &#x201c;The beaten can win tomorrow. The dead have lost forever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wisdom and cowardice can be hard to tell apart,&#x201d; snapped Skara.<br><br>The minister clenched her jaw. &#x201c;I swear I taught you wiser manners than to insult a guest. Nobility is shown not by the respect one is given by the highest, but the respect one gives to the lowly. Words are weapons. They should be handled with proper care.&#x201d;<br><br>Jenner waved any suggestion of offense gently away. &#x201c;No doubt Princess Skara has the right of it. I&#x2019;ve known many men far braver&#x2019;n me.&#x201d; He gave a sad smile, displaying a crooked set of teeth with several gaps. &#x201c;And seen most buried, one by one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bravery and long life rarely make good bedfellows,&#x201d; said the king, draining his cup again.<br><br>&#x201c;Kings and ale pair up no better,&#x201d; said Skara.<br><br>&#x201c;I have nothing left but ale, granddaughter. My warriors have abandoned me. My allies have deserted me. They swore fair-weather oaths, oak-firm while Mother Sun shone, prone to wilt when the clouds gather.&#x201d;<br><br>That was no secret. Day after day Skara had watched the docks, eager to see how many ships the Iron King Uthil of Gettland would bring, how many warriors would accompany the famous Grom-gil-Gorm of Vansterland. Day after day, as the leaves budded, then the leaves cast dappled shade, then the leaves turned brown and fell. They never came.<br><br>&#x201c;Loyalty is common in dogs but rare in men,&#x201d; observed Mother Kyre. &#x201c;A plan that relies on loyalty is worse than none at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What then?&#x201d; asked Skara. &#x201c;A plan that relies on cowardice?&#x201d;<br><br>Old, her grandfather looked as he turned to her with misty eyes and brewer&#x2019;s breath. Old and beaten. &#x201c;You have always been brave, Skara. Braver than I. No doubt the blood of Bail flows in your veins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your blood too, my king! You always told me only half a war is fought with swords. The other half is fought here.&#x201d; And Skara pressed one fingertip into the side of her head, so hard it hurt.<br><br>&#x201c;You have always been clever, Skara. Cleverer than I. The gods know you can talk the birds down from the sky when it pleases you. Fight that half of the war, then. Give me the deep cunning that can turn back the High King&#x2019;s armies and save our land and our people from Bright Yilling&#x2019;s sword. That can spare me from the shame of Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s terms.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara looked down at the straw-covered floor, face burning. &#x201c;I wish I could.&#x201d; But she was a girl seventeen winters old and, Bail&#x2019;s blood or no, her head held no hero&#x2019;s answers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Grandfather.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So am I, child.&#x201d; King Fynn slumped back and beckoned for more ale. &#x201c;So am I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>She was snatched from troubled dreams and into darkness, Mother Kyre&#x2019;s face ghostly in the light of one flickering candle.<br><br>&#x201c;Skara, get up.&#x201d;<br><br>She fumbled back the furs, clumsy with sleep. Strange sounds outside. Shouting and laughter.<br><br>She rubbed her eyes. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must go with Blue Jenner.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara saw the trader then, lurking in the doorway of her bedchamber. A black figure, shaggy-headed, eyes turned to the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre pulled her up by her arm. &#x201c;You must go now.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara was about to argue. As she always argued. Then she saw the minister&#x2019;s expression and it made her obey without a word spoken. She had never seen Mother Kyre afraid before.<br><br>It did not sound like laughter anymore, outside. Crying. Wild voices. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; she managed to croak.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a terrible mistake.&#x201d; Mother Kyre&#x2019;s eyes darted to the door and back. &#x201c;I trusted Grandmother Wexen.&#x201d; She twisted the gold ring from Skara&#x2019;s arm. The one Bail the Builder once wore into battle, its ruby glistening dark as new-spilled blood in the candlelight. &#x201c;This is for you.&#x201d; She held it out to Blue Jenner. &#x201c;If you swear to see her safe to Thorlby.&#x201d;<br><br>The raider&#x2019;s eyes flickered guiltily up as he took it. &#x201c;I swear it. A sun-oath and a moon-oath.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre clutched painfully hard at both of Skara&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Whatever happens, you must live. That is your duty now. You must live and you must lead. You must fight for Throvenland. You must stand for her people if . . . if there is no one else.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara&#x2019;s throat was so tight with fear she could hardly speak. &#x201c;Fight? But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have taught you how. I have tried to. Words are weapons.&#x201d; The minister wiped tears from Skara&#x2019;s face that she had not even realized she had cried. &#x201c;Your grandfather was right, you are brave and you are clever. But now you must be strong. You are a child no longer. Always remember, the blood of Bail flows in your veins. Now go.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara padded barefoot through the darkness at Blue Jenner&#x2019;s heels, shivering in her shift, Mother Kyre&#x2019;s lessons so deep-rooted that even fearing for her life she worried over whether she was properly dressed. Flames beyond the narrow windows cast stabbing shadows across the straw-scattered floor. She heard panicked shouts. A dog barking, suddenly cut off. A heavy thudding as of a tree being felled.<br><br>As of axes at the door.<br><br>They stole into the guest room, where warriors had slept shoulder to shoulder a few months before. Now there was only Blue Jenner&#x2019;s threadbare blanket.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; she whispered, hardly recognizing her own voice it came so thin and cracked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bright Yilling has come with his Companions,&#x201d; said Jenner, &#x201c;to settle Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s debts. Yaletoft is already burning. I&#x2019;m sorry, princess.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara flinched as he slid something around her neck. A collar of twisted silver wire, a fine chain clinking faintly. The kind the Ingling girl who used to bind her hair had worn.<br><br>&#x201c;Am I a slave?&#x201d; she whispered, as Jenner buckled the other end about his wrist.<br><br>&#x201c;You must seem to be.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara shrank back at a crash outside, the clash of metal, and Jenner pressed her against the wall. He blew his candle out and dropped them into darkness. She saw him draw a knife, Father Moon glinting on its edge.<br><br>Howls now, beyond the door, high and horrible, the bellows of beasts not the voices of men. Skara squeezed her eyes shut, tears stinging the lids, and prayed. Mumbling, stuttering, meaningless prayers. Prayers to every god and none.<br><br>It is easy to be brave when the Last Door seems tiny for its distance, a far-off thing for other folk to worry about. Now she felt Death&#x2019;s chill breath on her neck and it froze the courage in her. How freely she had talked of cowardice the night before. Now she understood what it was.<br><br>A last long shriek, then silence almost worse than the noise had been. She felt herself drawn forward, Jenner&#x2019;s breath stale on her cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; she breathed.<br><br>&#x201c;So am I. But if we face &#x2019;em boldly we might talk our way free. If they find us hiding . . .&#x201d;<br><br>You can only conquer your fears by facing them, her grandfather used to say. Hide from them, and they conquer you. Jenner eased the door creaking open and Skara forced herself through after him, her knees trembling so badly they were nearly knocking together.<br><br>Her bare foot slid in something wet. A dead man sat beside the door, the straw all about him black with blood.<br><br>Borid, his name. A warrior who had served her father. He had carried Skara on his shoulders when she was little, so she could reach the peaches in the orchard under the walls of Bail&#x2019;s Point.<br><br>Her stinging eyes crept toward the sound of voices. Over broken weapons and cloven shields. Over more corpses, hunched, sprawled, spread-eagled among the carved columns after which her grandfather&#x2019;s hall was called the Forest.<br><br>Figures were gathered in the light of the guttering firepit. Storied warriors, mail and weapons and ring-money gleaming with the colors of fire, their great shadows stretching out across the floor toward her.<br><br>Mother Kyre stood among them, and Skara&#x2019;s grandfather too, ill-fitting mail hastily dragged on, gray hair still wild from his bed. Smiling blandly upon his two prisoners was a slender warrior with a soft, handsome face, as careless as a child&#x2019;s, a space about him where even these other killers dared not tread.<br><br>Bright Yilling, who worshipped no god but Death.<br><br>His voice echoed jauntily in the vastness of the hall. &#x201c;I was hoping to pay my respects to Princess Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She has gone to her cousin Laithlin,&#x201d; said Mother Kyre. The same voice that had calmly lectured, corrected, chastised Skara every day of her life, but with an unfamiliar warble of terror in it now. &#x201c;Where you will never reach her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, we will reach her there,&#x201d; said one of Yilling&#x2019;s warriors, a huge man with a neck like a bull&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Soon enough, Mother Kyre, soon enough,&#x201d; said another with a tall spear and a horn at his belt.<br><br>&#x201c;King Uthil will come,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He will burn your ships and drive you back into the sea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How will he burn my ships when they are safe behind the great chains at Bail&#x2019;s Point?&#x201d; asked Yilling. &#x201c;The chains you gave me the key to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grom-gil-Gorm will come,&#x201d; she said, but her voice had faded almost to a whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope it will be so.&#x201d; Yilling reached out with both hands and ever so gently eased Mother Kyre&#x2019;s hair back over her shoulders. &#x201c;But he will come too late for you.&#x201d; He drew a sword, a great diamond in a golden claw for a pommel, mirror-steel flashing so bright in the darkness it left a white smear across Skara&#x2019;s sight.<br><br>&#x201c;Death waits for us all.&#x201d; King Fynn took a long breath through his nose, and proudly drew himself up. A glimpse of the man he used to be. He looked about the hall and, through the columns, caught Skara&#x2019;s eye, and it seemed to her he gave the slightest smile. Then he dropped to his knees. &#x201c;Today you kill a king.&#x201d;<br><br>Yilling shrugged. &#x201c;Kings and peasants. We all look the same to Death.&#x201d;<br><br>He stabbed Skara&#x2019;s grandfather where his neck met his shoulder, blade darting in to the hilt and back out, quick and deadly as lightning falls. King Fynn made only a dry squeak he died so fast, and toppled face forward into the firepit. Skara stood frozen, her breath held fast, her mind held fast.<br><br>Mother Kyre stared down at her master&#x2019;s corpse. &#x201c;Grandmother Wexen gave me her promise,&#x201d; she stammered out.<br><br>Pit pat, pit pat, the blood dripped from the point of Yilling&#x2019;s sword. &#x201c;Promises only bind the weak.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Skull Throne: Book Four of The Demon Cycle</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER �&nbsp;<b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>BUZZFEED <br><br></i></b></b>The first three novels in&nbsp;Peter V. Brett&#x2019;s groundbreaking Demon Cycle series&#x2014;<i>The Warded Man, The Desert Spear</i>, and <i>The Daylight War</i>&#x2014;set a new standard for heroic fantasy. The powerful saga of humans winnowed to the brink of extinction by night-stalking demons, and the survivors who fight back, has kept readers breathless as they eagerly turned the pages. Now the thrilling fourth volume, <i>The Skull Throne,</i> raises the stakes as it carries the action in shocking new directions.<br><br> The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty.<br><br> Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all.<br><br> But Arlen Bales, the Warded Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honor refuse. Rather than risk defeat, Arlen cast them both from a precipice, leaving the world without a savior, and opening a struggle for succession that threatens to tear the Free Cities of Thesa apart.<br><br> In the south, Inevera, Jardir&#x2019;s first wife, must find a way to keep their sons from killing one another and plunging their people into civil war as they strive for glory enough to make a claim on the throne.<br><br> In the north, Leesha Paper and Rojer Inn struggle to forge an alliance between the duchies of Angiers and Miln against the Krasians before it is too late.<br><br> Caught in the crossfire is the duchy of Lakton&#x2014;rich and unprotected, ripe for conquest.<br><br> All the while, the corelings have been growing stronger, and without Arlen and Jardir there may be none strong enough to stop them.

Raised on a steady diet of fantasy novels, comic books, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Brett has been writing fantasy stories for as long as he can remember.

He lives in New York.Chapter 1 The Hunt 333 AR Autumn <br>Jardir woke at sunset, his mind thick with fog. He was lying in a Northern bed&#x2014;one giant pillow instead of many. The bedcloth was rough, nothing like the silk to which he had become accustomed. The room was circular, with warded glass windows all around. A tower of some sort. Untamed land spread into the twilight, but he recognized none of it. <br><br>Where in Ala am I? <br><br>Pain lanced through him as he stirred, but pain was an old companion, embraced and forgotten. He pulled himself into a sitting position, rigid legs scraping against each other. He pulled the blanket aside. Plaster casts running thigh-to-foot. His toes, swollen in red, purple, and yellow, peeked from the far ends, close, yet utterly out of reach. He flexed them experimentally, ignoring the pain, and was satisfied with the slight twitch that rewarded him. <br><br>It harkened back to the broken arm he&#x2019;d suffered as a child, and the helplessness of his weeks of healing. <br><br>He reached immediately to the nightstand for the crown. Even in day, there was magic enough stored within to heal a few broken bones, especially ones already set. <br><br>His hands met empty air. Jardir turned and stared a long moment before the situation registered. It had been years since he had let himself be out of arm&#x2019;s reach of his crown and spear, but both were missing. <br><br>Memories came back to him in a rush. The fight atop the mountain with the Par&#x2019;chin. How the son of Jeph had collapsed into smoke as Jardir struck, only to solidify an instant later, grabbing the spear shaft with inhuman strength and twisting it from his grasp. <br><br>And then the Par&#x2019;chin turned and threw it from the cliff as if it were nothing more than a gnawed melon rind. <br><br>Jardir licked cracked lips. His mouth was dry and his bladder full, but both needs had been provided for. The water at his bedside was sweet, and with some effort he managed use of the chamber pot his searching fingers found on the floor just underneath the bed. <br><br>His chest was bound tightly, ribs grinding as he shifted. Over the bandages he was clad in a thin robe&#x2014;tan, he noted. The Par&#x2019;chin&#x2019;s idea of a joke, perhaps. <br><br>There was no door, simply a stair leading up into the room&#x2014;as good as prison bars in his current state. There were no other exits, nor did the steps continue on. He was at the top of the tower. The room was sparsely furnished. A small table by the bedside. A single chair. <br><br>There was a sound in the stairwell. Jardir froze, listening. He might be bereft of his crown and spear, but years of absorbing magic through them had remade his body as close to Everam&#x2019;s image as a mortal form could be. He had the eyes of a hawk, the nose of a wolf, and the ears of a bat. <br><br>&#x201c;Sure you can handle him?&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin&#x2019;s First Wife said. &#x201c;Thought he was going to kill you out on that cliff.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No worries, Ren,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t hurt me without the spear.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Can in daylight,&#x201d; Renna said. <br><br>&#x201c;Not with two broken legs,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;Got this, Ren. Honest word.&#x201d; <br><br>We shall see, Par&#x2019;chin. <br><br>There was a smacking of lips as the son of Jeph kissed his jiwah&#x2019;s remaining protests away. &#x201c;Need you back in the Hollow keepin&#x2019; an eye on things. Now, &#x2019;fore they get suspicious.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Leesha Paper&#x2019;s already suspicious,&#x201d; Renna said. &#x201c;Her guesses ent far from the mark.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t matter, long as they stay guesses,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;You just keep playin&#x2019; dim, no matter what she says or does.&#x201d; <br><br>Renna gave a stunted laugh. &#x201c;Ay, that won&#x2019;t be a problem. Like makin&#x2019; her want to spit.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t waste too much time on it,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;Need you to protect the Hollow, but keep a low profile. Strengthen the folk, but let them carry the weight. I&#x2019;ll skate in when I can, but only to see you. No one else can know I&#x2019;m alive.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; Renna said. &#x201c;Man and wife shouldn&#x2019;t be apart like this.&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin sighed. &#x201c;Ent nothin&#x2019; for it, Ren. Bettin&#x2019; the farm on this throw. Can&#x2019;t afford to lose. I&#x2019;ll see you soon enough.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; Renna said. <br><br>&#x201c;Love you, Arlen Bales.&#x201d; &#x201c;Love you, Renna Bales,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. They kissed again, and Jardir heard rapid footsteps as she descended the tower. The Par&#x2019;chin, however, began to climb. <br><br>For a moment Jardir thought to feign sleep. Perhaps he might learn something; gain the element of surprise. <br><br>He shook his head. I am Shar&#x2019;Dama Ka. It is beneath me to hide. I will meet the Par&#x2019;chin&#x2019;s eyes and see what remains of the man I knew. <br><br>He propped himself up, embracing the roar of pain in his legs. His face was serene as the Par&#x2019;chin entered. He wore plain clothes, much as he had when they first met, a cotton shirt of faded white and worn denim trousers with a leather Messenger satchel slung over one shoulder. His feet were bare, pant and shirt cuffs rolled to show the wards he had inked into his skin. His sand-colored hair was shaved away, and the face Jardir remembered was barely recognizable under all the markings. <br><br>Even without his crown, Jardir could sense the power of those symbols, but the strength came with a heavy price. The Par&#x2019;chin looked more like a page from one of the holy scrolls of warding than a man. <br><br>&#x201c;What have you done to yourself, old friend?&#x201d; He had not meant to speak the words aloud, but something pushed him. <br><br>&#x201c;Got a lot of nerve callin&#x2019; me that, after what you did,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;Din&#x2019;t do this to myself. You did this to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I?&#x201d; Jardir asked. &#x201c;I took ink and profaned your body with it?&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin shook his head. &#x201c;You left me to die in the desert, without weapon or succor, and knew I&#x2019;d be corespawned before I let the alagai have me. My body was the only thing you left me to ward.&#x201d; <br><br>With those words, all Jardir&#x2019;s questions about how the Par&#x2019;chin had survived were answered. In his mind&#x2019;s eye he saw his friend alone in the desert, parched and bloodied as he beat alagai to death with his bare hands. <br><br>It was glorious. <br><br>The Evejah forbade the tattooing of flesh, but it forbade many things Jardir had since permitted for the sake of Sharak Ka. He wanted to condemn the Par&#x2019;chin, but his throat tightened at the truth of the man&#x2019;s words. <br><br>Jardir shivered as a chill of doubt touched his center. No thing happened, but that Everam willed it. It was inevera that the Par&#x2019;chin should live to meet him again. The dice said each of them might be the Deliverer. Jardir had dedicated his life to being worthy of that title. He was proud of his accomplishments, but could not deny that his ajin&#x2019;pal, the brave outsider, might have greater honor in Everam&#x2019;s eyes. <br><br>&#x201c;You play at rituals you do not understand, Par&#x2019;chin,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Domin Sharum is to the death, and victory was yours. Why did you not take it and claim your place at the lead of the First War?&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin sighed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no victory in your death, Ahmann.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then you admit I am the Deliverer?&#x201d; Jardir asked. &#x201c;If that is so, then return my spear and crown to me, put your head to the floor, and have done. All will be forgiven, and we can face Nie side by side once more.&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin snorted. He set his satchel on the table, reaching inside. The Crown of Kaji gleamed even in the growing darkness, its nine gems glittering. Jardir could not deny the desire the item stirred in him. If he&#x2019;d had legs to stand, he would have leapt for it. <br><br>&#x201c;Crown&#x2019;s right here.&#x201d; The Par&#x2019;chin spun the pointed circlet on a finger like a child&#x2019;s hoop toy. &#x201c;But the spear ent yours. Least, not &#x2019;less I decide to give it to you. Hidden where you can never get it, even if your legs wern&#x2019;t casted.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The holy items belong together,&#x201d; Jardir said. <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin sighed again. &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s holy, Ahmann. Told you once before Heaven was a lie. You threatened to kill me over the words, but that doesn&#x2019;t make &#x2019;em any less true.&#x201d; <br><br>Jardir opened his mouth to reply, angry words forming on his lips, but the Par&#x2019;chin cut him off, catching the spinning crown in a firm grip and holding it up. As he did, the wards on his skin throbbed briefly with light, and those on the crown began to glow. <br><br>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said of the crown, &#x201c;is a thin band of mind demon skull and nine horns, coated in a warded alloy of silver and gold, focused by gemstones. It is a masterwork of wardcraft, but nothing more.&#x201d; <br><br>He smiled. &#x201c;Much as your earring was.&#x201d; <br><br>Jardir started, raising his hand to touch the bare lobe his wedding ring had once pierced. &#x201c;Do you mean to steal my First Wife, as well as my throne?&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin laughed, a genuine sound Jardir had not heard in years. A sound he could not deny he had missed. <br><br>&#x201c;Not sure which would be the greater burden,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;I want neither. I have a wife, and among my people one is more&#x2019;n enough.&#x201d; <br><br>Jardir felt a smile tug at his lips, and he let it show. &#x201c;A worthy Jiwah Ka is both support and burden, Par&#x2019;chin. They challenge us to be better men, and that is ever a struggle.&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin nodded. &#x201c;Honest word.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then why have you stolen my ring?&#x201d; Jardir demanded. <br><br>&#x201c;Just holding on to it while you&#x2019;re under my roof,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t have you calling for help.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d; Jardir said. <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin tilted his head at him, and Jardir could feel the son of Jeph&#x2019;s gaze reaching into his soul, much as Jardir did when he had the gift of crownsight. How did the Par&#x2019;chin do it without the crown at his brow? <br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said after a moment. He barked a laugh. &#x201c;Giving me marriage advice while your own wife spies on you!&#x201d; <br><br>The derision in his tone angered Jardir, and his brows drew tight despite his desire to keep his face calm. &#x201c;What is that supposed to mean?&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin reached into his pocket, producing the earring. It was a simple hoop of gold with a delicate warded ball hanging from it. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a broken piece of demon bone in here, with its opposite half in your wife&#x2019;s ear. Lets her hear everything you do.&#x201d; <br><br>Suddenly so many mysteries became clear to Jardir. How his wife seemed to know his every plan and secret. Much of her information came from the dice, but the alagai hora spoke in riddles as oft as not. He should have known cunning Inevera would not rely on her castings alone. <br><br>&#x201c;So she knows you&#x2019;ve kidnapped me?&#x201d; Jardir asked. <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin shook his head. &#x201c;Blocked its power. She won&#x2019;t be able to find you before we&#x2019;re finished here.&#x201d; <br><br>Jardir crossed his arms. &#x201c;Finished with what? You will not follow me, and I will not follow you. We stand at the same impasse we found five years ago in the Maze.&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin nodded. &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t bring yourself to kill me then, and it forced me to change how I see the world. Offering you the same.&#x201d; With that, he tossed the crown across the room. <br><br>Instinctively, Jardir caught it. &#x201c;Why return it to me? Won&#x2019;t this heal my wounds? You may have difficulty holding me without them.&#x201d; <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin shrugged. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll leave without the spear, but I&#x2019;ve drained the crown in any event. Not a lot of magic venting from the Core makes it this high,&#x201d; he waved his hand at the windows circling the room on all sides, &#x201c;and the sun cleans out this room each morning. It&#x2019;ll give you crownsight, but not much else until it&#x2019;s recharged.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;So why return it to me?&#x201d; Jardir asked again. <br><br>&#x201c;Thought we might have a talk,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;And I want you to see my aura while we do. Want you to see the truth of my words, the strength of my convictions, written on my very soul. Perhaps then, you&#x2019;ll come to see.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Come to see what?&#x201d; Jardir asked. &#x201c;That Heaven is a lie? Nothing written on your soul can do that, Par&#x2019;chin.&#x201d; Nevertheless, he slipped the crown onto his head. Immediately the darkened room came alive with crownsight, and Jardir breathed deep in relief, like the blind man in the Evejah, given his sight back by Kaji. <br><br>Through the windows, land that had been nothing but shadows and vague shapes a moment ago became sharply defined, lit with the magic that vented from Ala. All living things held a spark of power at their core, and Jardir could see strength glowing in the trunks of trees, the moss that clung to them, and every animal that lived within their branches and bark. It ran through the grasses of the plains and, most of all, in the demons that stalked the land and rode the winds. The alagai shone like beacons, waking a primal desire in him to hunt and kill. <br><br>As the Par&#x2019;chin had warned, his cell was dimmer. Small tendrils of power drifted up the tower walls, Drawn to the wards etched into the glass windows. They flickered to life, a shield against the alagai. <br><br>But though the room was dim, the Par&#x2019;chin shone brighter than a demon. So bright it should be difficult to look at him. But it was not. Quite the contrary, the magic was glorious to behold, rich and tempting. Jardir reached out through the crown, attempting to Draw a touch of it to himself. Not so much the Par&#x2019;chin might sense the drain, but perhaps enough to speed his healing. A wisp of power snaked through the air toward him like incense smoke. <br><br>The Par&#x2019;chin had shaved his brows, but the wards above his left eye lifted in an unmistakable expression. His aura shifted, showing more bemusement than offense. &#x201c;Ah-ah. Get your own.&#x201d; Abruptly, the magic reversed its flow and was Drawn back into him. <br><br>Jardir kept his face calm, though he doubted it made a difference. The Par&#x2019;chin was right. He could read the man&#x2019;s aura, seeing his every feeling, and had no doubt his old friend could do the same. The Par&#x2019;chin was calm, centered, and meant Jardir no harm. There was no deception in him. Only weariness, and fear Jardir would be too rigid to give his words fair consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;Tell me again why I am here, Par&#x2019;chin,&#x201d; Jardir said. &#x201c;If your goal is truly as you have always said, to rid the world of alagai, then why do you oppose me? I am close to fulfilling your dream.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not as close as you think,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said. &#x201c;And the way you&#x2019;re doing it disgusts me. You choke and threaten humanity to its own salvation, not caring the cost. Know you Krasians like to dress in black and white, but the world ent so simple. There&#x2019;s color, and more than a fair share of gray.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I am not a fool, Par&#x2019;chin,&#x201d; Jardir said. <br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I wonder,&#x201d; the Par&#x2019;chin said, and his aura agreed. It was a bitter tea that his old friend, whom he had taught so much and always respected, should think so little of him.</p><h2>Shiloh: A novel</h2><p>Foote, Shelby, Shiloh: A Novel</p><p>In the novel <i>Shiloh</i>, historian and Civil War expert Shelby Foote delivers a spare, unflinching account of the battle of Shiloh, which was fought over the course of two days in April 1862. By mirroring the troops' movements through the woods of Tennessee with the activity of each soldier's mind, Foote offers the reader a broad perspective of the battle and a detailed view of the issues behind it. The battle becomes tangible as Foote interweaves the observations of Union and Confederate officers, simple foot soldiers, brave men, and cowards and describes the roar of the muskets and the haze of the gun smoke. The author's vivid storytelling creates a rich chronicle of a pivotal battle in American history.This fictional re-creation of the battle of Shiloh in April 1862 fulfills the standard set by his monumental history, conveying both the bloody choreography of two armies and the movements of the combatants' hearts and minds.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>O Is for Outlaw (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries (Paperback))</h2><p>Once Mickey Magruder was a cop with a wild streak. And Kinsey Millhone was a younger cop who adored and married him. Then Mickey was implicated in a fatal beating, and Kinsey walked out. Now, fourteen years later, she comes face-to-face with those tragic years and Mickey's harrowing downward spiral after he lost the job he loved--and the marriage he loved a little less.<br><br>Mickey lies dying in an L.A. hospital. Trying to find out how Mickey got there, Kinsey uncovers evidence that he was innocent of the beating charge. But as she searches through the lives that swirled around Mickey's--lives gone wrong and lives gone well--Kinsey must also search the blind spots of her own life, including one that hides a killer.</p><p>Wise-cracking, staunchly independent, and chronically curious, Grafton's gritty gumshoe Kinsey Millhone is back. This time, the alphabet series star will take on the toughest case to date: her past. What begins as a random phone call from a "storage space scavenger" (someone who buys the contents of defaulted storage units) leads Kinsey to a box of old papers and personal effects that her ex-husband, Mickey Magruder, left behind. Inside, she finds a 15-year-old unsent letter from a bartender that, among other things, reveals her former hubby was having an affair. The letter also contains details about the murder of a transient--a crime for which Mickey was blamed. Although never convicted, Mickey was ruined--losing his job, wife, and friends. But 15 years later, Kinsey realizes that foul play may have been involved in the murder, a deadly temptation for her.<p> Die-hard fans will especially enjoy Kinsey's self-disclosure--something she's infamous for not doing--about her childhood, the fate of her parents, and the randy details of her first marriage. A very vulnerable and interesting side to Kinsey's character is also revealed when her obsessive-compulsive fact-finding bent is mixed up with matters of the heart. </p><p> A fast, fun read, <i>O Is for Outlaw</i> is packed with Grafton's clear, colorful imagery and signature metaphors: "Our recollection of the past is not simply distorted by our faulty perception of events remembered, but skewed by those forgotten. The memory is like orbiting twin stars, one visible, one dark, the trajectory of what's evident forever affected by the gravity of what's concealed." <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>"Book for book, this may be the most satisfying mystery series going." -- The Wall Street Journal <br> <br>"Unlike many detective series, Grafton's seems only to get better each time out." -- Entertainment Weekly</p><h2>Joy Unspeakable</h2><p>Holmes&#39;s research - through oral histories, church records, and written accounts - details not only ways in which contemplative experience is built into African American collective worship but also the legacy of African monasticism, a history of spiritual exemplars, and unique meditative worship practices.</p><p>Barbara A.

It is there, in the vast and porous Great North Woods, that a dangerous smuggling operation is taking place, run by a group of disenchanted former soldiers, newly returned from Iraq. Illicit goods&#x2014;drugs, cash, weapons, even people&#x2014;are changing hands. And something else has changed hands. Something ancient and powerful and evil.</p><p>The authorities suspect something is amiss, but what they can&#x2019;t know is that it is infinitely stranger and more terrifying than anyone can imagine. Anyone, that is, except private detective Charlie Parker, who has his own intimate knowledge of the darkness in men&#x2019;s hearts. As the smugglers begin to die one after another in apparent suicides, Parker is called in to stop the bloodletting. The soldiers&#x2019; actions and the objects they have smuggled have attracted the attention of the reclusive Herod, a man with a taste for the strange. And where Herod goes, so too does the shadowy figure that he calls the Captain.

She was buried beneath broken glass and shards of pottery, under discarded clothing, pieces of furniture, and old newspapers used as packing materials. She should have been rendered almost invisible amid the dust and the darkness, but Dr. Al-Daini had spent decades searching for girls such as she, and he picked her out where others might simply have passed over her.</p><p>Only her head was exposed, her blue eyes open, her lips stained a faded red. He knelt beside her, and brushed some of the detritus from her. Outside, he could hear yelling, and the rumble of tanks changing position. Suddenly, bright light illuminated the hallway, and there were armed men shouting and giving orders, but they had come too late. Others like them had stood by while this had happened, their priorities lying elsewhere. They did not care about the girl, but Dr. Al-Daini cared. He had recognized her immediately, because she had always been one of his favorites. Her beauty had captivated him from the first moment he set eyes on her, and in the years that followed he had never failed to make time to spend a quiet moment or two with her during the day, to exchange a greeting or merely to stand with her and mirror her smile with one of his own.</p><p>Perhaps she might still be saved, he thought, but as he carefully shifted wood and stone he recognized that there was little he could do for her now. Her body was shattered, broken into pieces in an act of desecration that made no sense to him. This was not accidental, but deliberate: he could see marks on the floor where booted feet had pounded upon her legs and arms, reducing them to fragments. Yet, somehow, her head had escaped the worst of the violence, and Dr. Al-Daini could not decide if this rendered what had been visited upon her less awful, or more terrible.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, little one,&#x201d; he whispered as he gently stroked her cheek, the first time that he had touched her in fifteen years. &#x201c;What have they done to you? What have they done to us all?&#x201d;</p><p>He should have stayed. He should not have left her, should not have left any of them, but the Fedayeen had been battling the Americans near the Ministry of Information, the sounds of gunfire and explosions reaching them even as they sandbagged friezes and wrapped foam rubber around the statues, grateful that they had at least managed to transport some of the treasures to safety before the invasion commenced. The fighting had then spread to the television station, less than a kilometer away, and to the central bus station at the other side of the complex, drawing closer and closer to them. He had argued in favor of staying, for they had stockpiled food and water in the basement, but many of the others felt that the risks were too great. All but one of the guards had fled, abandoning their weapons and their uniforms, and there were already black-garbed gunmen in the museum garden. So they had locked the front doors and left through the back entrance before fleeing across the river to the eastern side, where they waited in the house of a colleague for the fighting to cease.</p><p>But it did not stop. When they attempted to return over the Bridge of the Medical City they were turned back, and so they stayed with their colleague once again, and drank coffee, and waited some more. Perhaps they had remained there for too long, debating back and forth the wisdom of abandoning what was, for now, a place of safety, but what else could they have done? Yet he could not forgive himself, or assuage his guilt. He had abandoned her, and they had had their way with her.</p><p>And now he was crying, not from the dirt and filth but from rage and hurt and loss. He did not stop, not even as booted feet approached him and a soldier shone a flashlight in his face. There were others behind him, their weapons raised.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, who are you?&#x201d; asked the soldier.</p><p>Dr. Al-Daini did not reply. He could not. All his attention was fixed on the eyes of the broken girl.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, do you speak English? I&#x2019;ll ask you one more time: who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>Dr. Al-Daini picked up on the nervousness in the soldier&#x2019;s voice, but also the hint of arrogance, the natural superiority of the conqueror over the conquered. He sighed, and raised his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Dr. Mufid Al-Daini,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and I am the deputy curator of Roman Antiquities at this museum.&#x201d; Then he reconsidered. &#x201c;No, I <i>was</i> the Deputy Curator of Roman Antiquities, but now there is no museum left. Now there are only fragments. You let this happen. You stood by and let this happen....&#x201d;</p><p>But he was speaking as much to himself as he was to them, and the words turned to ash in his mouth. The staff had left the museum on Tuesday. On Saturday, they learned that the museum had been looted, and then began to return in an effort to assess the damage and prevent any further theft. Someone said that the looting had commenced as early as Thursday, when hundreds of people had gathered at the fence surrounding the museum. For two days, they were free to ransack. Already, there were rumors that insiders had been involved, some of the museum&#x2019;s own guardians targeting the most valuable artifacts. The thieves took everything that could be moved, and much of what they could not take they attempted to destroy.</p><p>Dr. Al-Daini and some others had gone to the headquarters of the marines and pleaded for help in securing the building, for the staff was fearful that the looters would return, and the U.S. Army tanks at the intersection only fifty meters from the museum had refused to come to their aid, citing orders. They were eventually promised guards by the Americans, but only now, on Wednesday, had they come. Dr. Al-Daini had arrived just shortly before them, for he had been one of those assigned the role of liaison with the soldiers and the media, and he had spent the previous days being passed up and down the military ranks and providing contacts for journalists.</p><p>Carefully, he raised the head of the broken girl, youthful yet ancient, the paint still visible on her hair and mouth and eyes after almost four thousand years.</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said, still weeping. &#x201c;Look at what they did to her.&#x201d;</p><p>And the soldiers stared for a moment at this old man covered in white dust, a hollow head in his hands, before moving on to secure the looted halls of the Iraq Museum. They were young men, and this operation was about the future, not the past. No lives had been lost, not here. These things happened.</p><p>After all, there was a war on.</p><p><b>DR. AL-DAINI WATCHED THE</b> soldiers go. He looked around and saw a swatch of paint-spattered cloth lying by a fallen display case. He checked it and found it to be relatively clean, so he placed the head of the girl upon it, then wrapped the cloth carefully around her, tying a knot with the four corners so that he might more easily carry her. He stood wearily, the head now hanging from his left hand, like an executioner bearing to his potentate the evidence of the ax&#x2019;s work. So lifelike was the girl&#x2019;s expression, and so troubled and shocked was Dr. Al-Daini, that he would not have been surprised had the severed neck begun to bleed through the material, casting red drops like petals upon the dusty floor. All around him were reminders of what had once been, absences like open wounds. Jewelry had been taken from skeletons, their bones scattered. Statues had been decapitated, so that the most striking aspect of them might more easily be carried away. Curious, he thought, that the girl&#x2019;s head, exquisite as it was, should have been overlooked, or perhaps it was enough for whomever had broken her that her body was ruined, enough to have removed a little beauty from the world.</p><p>The scale of the destruction was overwhelming. The Warka vase, a masterpiece of Sumerian art from about 3500 B.C., and the world&#x2019;s oldest carved stone ritual vessel, was gone, hacked away from its base. A beautiful bull-headed lyre had been reduced to kindling as the gold was stripped from it. The Bassetki statue base: gone. The statue of Entema: gone. The Warka mask, the first naturalistic sculpture of a human face: gone. He passed through room after room, replacing all that was lost with phantasms, ghosts of themselves&#x2014;here, an ivory seal, there a bejeweled crown&#x2014;so that what had once been was superimposed over the wreckage of the present. Even now, still nearly numb at the extent of the damage that had been done, Dr. Al-Daini was already cataloging the collection in his mind, trying to recall the age and provenance of each precious relic in case the museum&#x2019;s own records might no longer be available to them when they began the seemingly impossible task of recovering what had been taken.</p><p>Relics.</p><p>Dr. Al-Daini stopped walking. He swayed slightly, and his eyes closed. A soldier passing by asked him if he was okay and offered him water, a small gesture of kindness that Dr. Al-Daini was unable to acknowledge, so grave was his disquiet. Instead, he turned to the soldier and gripped his arms, a movement that might well have ended his troubles on the spot had the soldier in question had his finger on the trigger of his gun.</p><p>&#x201c;I am Dr. Mufid Al-Daini,&#x201d; he told the soldier. &#x201c;I am a deputy curator here at the museum. Please, I need you to help me. I have to get to the basement. I must check something. It is very, very important. You must help me to get through.&#x201d;</p><p>He gestured at the shapes of the armed men ahead of them, beige figures in the darkened hallways. The young man before him looked doubtful, then shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to let go of my shoulders fi...</p></p><h2>The Authority of the Believer</h2><p>Drawing on the ocncept of authority from Ephesians, MacMillan shows how spiritual authority can be used to confront demonic intruders and to facilitate the extension of God&#39;s kingdom.</p><p>We are excited to be the new owners of the publishing rights of this classic.<b>John A.

It is history as it ought to be written - from the bottom up and the top down, with monumental sensitivity to the compromise and conflict between the two extremes. Its two stories - those of Henry Ford and Ford-worker Abner Shutt, unfold side by side, indeed dialectically. They are, in the end, one story: the saga of class and culture in &#39;Ford-America&#39;. Workers and bosses, flappers and Klansmen, war and depression, Prohibition outlaws and high-society parties, unions and anti-union gun thugs - few aspects of American life in the first four decades of the last century are missing from this small masterpiece. The Flivver King sustains the same sure grasp of working class life which characterized Sinclair&#39;s earlier classic, The Jungle, but much less sentimentally and with a steadier focus on how alienated work breeds not only degradation but also resistance and revolt. Originally written in 1937 to aid the United Automobile Workers&#39; organizing drive, The Flivver King answers the question &#34;Why do we need a union?&#34; with quiet eloquence. Kerr have reissued it as a great American novel and an important historical document, but most of all because that question has never gone away and is now more vital than ever. With an introduction from Steve Meyer.</p><p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore in September 1878. His father moved the family to New York City in 1888. Although his own family was extremely poor, he spent periods of time living with his wealthy grandparents. He later argued that witnessing these extremes turned him into a socialist. Sinclair funded his college education by writing stories for newspapers and magazines. Sinclair s first novel was published in 1901. Sinclair was extremely active in socialist politics throughout his life. His novel &#34;Dragon s Teeth&#34; (1942) on the rise of Nazism won him the Pulitzer Prize.

He is a history professor emeritus at Northwestern University.As a chronicler of our national past, the prolific Garry Wills bites off big chews: Washington's character, Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. And now we have this fascinating book on Henry Adams's titanic work, nine volumes in total, History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson and History of the United States of America During the Administrations of James Madison: titles as ponderous as Wills's book itself is lithe and stimulating. <p> Indeed, Adams's mouthful of a title just may account in part for the History's perennial neglect, even by literate students of American history. When in 1888 Adams delivered the first six volumes, he estimated that he had spent $20,000 out of his own pocket researching U.S. and European archives. He valued his decade-long labor at an additional $60,000. The initial sales and royalties ($5,300) fell far short of retrieving his investment. That, along with the 1885 suicide of his cherished wife, Clover, may have brought on the darker mood that marked his later decades and his equally distinguished (and far more famous) autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams. As Wills observes, that later mood may explain the misconceptions that have lingered about the History from the outset.</p><p> In Part I, Wills shows how Adams prepared himself to essay a masterwork of Gibbon-esque reach -- a classic narrative history in the grand 18th- and 19th-century manner, offering a day-to-day account that simultaneously tells a story of large thematic scope about the emerging republic. He had served as his father's secretary in the U.S. mission to London during the Civil War. Before that, he had reported as a journalist (with matchless sources) during the "secession winter" of 1861. He had taught medieval history at Harvard and for six years had edited the North American Review, the most important journal of the post-Civil War period. Not least, he was the grandson and great-grandson of the Adams presidents -- and heir through them to a legacy of historical consciousness.</p><p> That family heritage, however, was also a liability that has tended to impair an accurate reading of the History, viewed by some historians and readers as an attempt to vindicate Adams's presidential ancestors and their Federalist principles. As Wills shows, this is a flagrant misconception. The fact is that Henry Adams had strong reservations about the Adams presidents. He personally disliked his formidable grandfather, John Quincy, but venerated his grandmother, Louisa Johnson Adams, who (though English-born) came of Maryland stock on her father's side and seemed a far more congenial character. Wills makes much -- perhaps a shade too much -- of Adams's self-identification with his grandmother as a sort of honorary Southerner. There can be no doubt, however, that Adams's editing of her diaries and letters contributed to his understanding of Jefferson and Madison and his grasp of what Adams calls the "Virginia" political outlook. </p><p> A big, thick pudding of a history needs a savory theme, and Adams had one. He set out to show how the United States of 1800, riven by faction and sectionalism at an important moment of transition, transformed itself under two presidencies into the thriving nation that emerged from the War of 1812. For Adams, it was a classic comedy (worthy of Beaumarchais) in which Jeffersonian ideals of minimalist government were confounded by events. The Jeffersonians, with their severely constricted notions of the proper scope of government, were thrust by fortune and a succession of remote steps (beginning with Napoleon's whimsical decision to sell Louisiana) toward a centralized and nationalist policy. Wills emphasizes, as Adams did, the role of Napoleon in American fortunes; indeed, Adams was the first major American historian to set the early story of the republic's development in its European context. Left to his own devices, Wills comments, Jefferson "would recall embassies, put the navy to sleep, get rid of all taxes but customs duties, and give himself little to do." None of it happened, much as the minimalist Jefferson might have wished; the world rudely intruded.</p><p> Henry Adams and the Making of America is original in both conception and execution. Watching one of our best historians address himself to a masterpiece of U.S. history is especially welcome at a time of gathering historical amnesia in which bad teaching from laundered textbooks has left so many of us bored by our past and ignorant of it.</p><p> That said, a few reservations. As in his previous books, Wills emerges as a quick study of whatever he sets his hand to, raking more fresh material from one book or document than drier writers do from whole library shelves. The effect is often dazzling, which is one secret of his charm as a writer. But he tends to draw from his fresh discoveries the occasionally misleading impression that he is the first to chart a given terrain. (One recalls the suggestion by Mr. Dooley, the barroom pundit with a thick brogue invented by the humorist Peter Finley Dunne, that Theodore Roosevelt's account of the Spanish-American War should be called "Alone in Cubia.") But Wills isn't always "alone in Cubia," and he certainly isn't alone in his appreciation of Adams's History. This minor irritant might be overlooked except that the compulsion to be original even when he is merely tendentious is a recurrent thread in Wills's otherwise engaging work.</p><p> "Can these people not read?" he asks in exasperation about one scholar's alleged misinterpretation of Adams's mini-biography of Randolph of Roanoke. He asks the same question of other explorers of the History. Well, yes; others can indeed read, though their responses may differ. Wills claims in this book to be retrieving the true themes of the History from the widespread misunderstanding that the work is an apologia for the Adams presidents, but he overlooks distinguished predecessors -- notably Herbert Agar and George Dangerfield -- whose grasp of the themes of the great work is hardly inferior to his own. The brighter side of the same coin is Wills's knack for illuminating neglected historical nooks and crannies, as in his celebration of the genius of Joshua Humphreys, the naval architect whose fine frigates -- six of them, built under Federalist rule before Jefferson tried to dry-dock the Navy -- were crucial to national pride and prowess in the War of 1812.</p><p> An occasional error of detail notwithstanding -- for instance, the English historian John Richard Green, Adams's friend and model, was not a medievalist, and his connection with the Oxford historical school was tenuous -- Wills achieves here a palpable hit. Writer and subject are beautifully matched. The result is a sparkling and engaging book that everyone who cares about American history should read; in its pages, they can reacquaint themselves with a masterly narrative explaining how the United States, after shaky beginnings, became a nation of consequence. And after the delicious appetizer, by all means try the main course itself: Henry Adams's nonpareil History. Nothing better of its kind has ever been written on these shores. </p><p>Reviewed by Edwin M. Yoder Jr. <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

Leader of the Symbolist movement, he exerted a powerful influence on modern literature and thought, which can be traced in the works of Paul Val�ry, W.B. Yeats, and Jacques Derrida. From his early twenties until the time of his death, Mallarm� produced poems of astonishing originality and beauty, many of which have become classics.<br><br>In the <i>Collected Poems,</i> Henry Weinfield brings the oeuvre of this European master to life for an English-speaking audience, essentially for the first time. All the poems that the author chose to retain are here, superbly rendered by Weinfield in a translation that comes remarkably close to Mallarm�'s own voice. Weinfield conveys not simply the meaning but the spirit and music of the French originals, which appear <i>en face</i>.<br><br>Whether writing in verse or prose, or inventing an altogether new genre&#x2014;as he did in the amazing "Coup de D�s"&#x2014;Mallarm� was a poet of both supreme artistry and great difficulty. To illuminate Mallarm�'s poetry for twentieth-century readers, Weinfield provides an extensive commentary that is itself an important work of criticism. He sets each poem in the context of the work as a whole and defines the poems' major symbols. Also included are an introduction and a bibliography.<br><br>Publication of this collection is a major literary event in the English-speaking world: here at last is the work of a major figure, masterfully translated.</p><p>"Weinfield's versions are superb&#x2014;true miracles, I believe&#x2014;and give us the flavor of Mallarm�'s work for the first time."&#x2014;Paul Auster, Editor, <i>The Random House Book of 20th-Century French Poetry</i><b>Henry Weinfield</b>, Professor of Liberal Studies at the University of Notre Dame, is author of three collections of poetry and <i>The Poet without a Name: Gray's Elegy and the Problem of History</i> (1991).</p><h2>Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins</h2><p><p>The first Edition of the <em>Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins</em> detailed the fascinating and little known stories behind thousands of words and phrases that we use every day.

Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.</p><p><em>The Invention of Science</em> goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts&#x2014;Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe&#x2014;whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.</p><p>From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization&#x2014;and the birth of the modern world we know.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> Here&#x2019;s a big, fat history of science (spanning from 1572 to 1704) with a very clear thesis: that science, and thus the world, entered the modern age during this precise span. Wooton, the Anniversary Professor of History at the University of York, explores primary texts and detailed history to build his argument that Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s discovery of a new star in 1572 started a scientific revolution, and that Isaac Newton&#x2019;s 1704 publication of <em>Opticks</em> sealed it. What happened in between was a series of discoveries&#x2014;of gunpowder, movable type, the New World, etc.&#x2014;that altered our perception of <em>what is</em> and, through the Newtonian Revolution, opened our minds to <em>what might be</em>. The sheer size of the book allows readers to jump around between essays, but taken as a whole <em>The Invention of Science</em> builds a powerful, thoroughly fascinating argument ripe for debate. --<em>Chris Schluep</em></p><p>We live in a world made by science. How and when did this happen? <em>The Invention of Science</em> tells the story of the extraordinary intellectual and cultural revolution that gave birth to modern science, and mounts a major challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy of its history.</p><p>Before 1492, all significant knowledge was believed to be already available; there was no concept of progress, as people looked to the past, not the future, for understanding. David Wootton argues that the discovery of America demonstrated that new knowledge was possible: indeed, it introduced the very concept of discovery and opened the way to the invention of science.</p><p>The first crucial discovery was Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s nova of 1572: proof that there could be change in the heavens. The invention of the telescope in 1608 rendered the old astronomy obsolete. Evangelista Torricelli&#x2019;s experiment with the vacuum in 1643 led directly to the triumph of the experimental method in the Royal Society of Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By 1750, Newtonianism was being celebrated throughout Europe.</p><p>This new science did not consist simply of new discoveries or methods. It relied on a new understanding of what knowledge may be, and with this came a fresh language: <em>discovery</em>, <em>progress</em>, <em>fact</em>, <em>experiment</em>, <em>hypothesis</em>, <em>theory</em>, <em>laws of nature</em>. Although almost all these terms existed before 1492, their meanings were radically transformed, and they became tools to think scientifically. Now we all speak this language of science that was invented during the Scientific Revolution.</p><p>This revolution had its martyrs (Bruno, Galileo), its heroes (Kepler, Boyle), its propagandists (Voltaire, Diderot), and its patient laborers (Gilbert, Hooke). The new culture led to a new rationalism, killing off alchemy, astrology, and the belief in witchcraft. It also led to the invention of the steam engine and to the first Industrial Revolution. Wootton&#x2019;s landmark work changes our understanding of how this great transformation came about, and of what science is.</p></p><h2>Amish Friends Cookbook</h2><p>New, from Barbour&#39;s best-selling author of fiction, Wanda E.

You've hiked up into the canyon where those deliciously deep potholes are -- the big-fish water -- but have found that today the trout are working the shallow, fast runs. It took you two hours to figure that out, but it's a good sign. They're hungry and, as your partner says, they are "looking up." You're fishing a scud pattern, not <i>the scud</i> pattern, but one you worked out yourself. The differences are minute but are enough to make it your fly and you are catching fish on it, which is highly satisfactory.<br><br>You're working the near edge of a fast rip about thirty yards above a strong plunge pool, flipping the weighted nymph rig upstream and following its descent with the rod tip. Your concentration is imperfect as you toy with the idea that this is okay, a fascinating and demanding way to fish, actually, but that too many days of it in a row could make you homesick for the easy grace of real fly-casting.<br><br>At the little jiggle in the leader that was just a hair too intelligent looking to be nothing but current or a rock, you raise the rod to set the hook, and there's weight. And then there's movement -- it's a fish.<br><br>It's a big fish, not wiggling, but boring, shaking its head in puzzlement and aggravation, but not in fear. It's impressive.<br><br>Almost lazily, the trout rises from the bottom into the faster current near the surface, rolls into the rip, and is off downstream. What you feel is more weight than fight, and the wings of panic begin to flutter around your throat. This is the once- or twice-a-year "oh-shit" fish. You should have tried to catch a glimpse of him when he turned -- the only glimpse you may get -- but it all happened so fast. No it didn't. It actually happened rather slowly, almost lazily, as you just pointed out.<br><br>You are careful (too careful? not careful enough?). The hook is a stout, heavy-wire number 10, but the tippet is only a 5x, about 4-pound test. The rod is an 8 1/2-foot cane with plenty of backbone in the butt, but with a nicely sensitive tip (catalog talk, but true). The drag on the reel is set light, and line is leaving it smoothly. You drop the rod to half-mast to give the fish his head and are, in fact, doing everything right. It's hopeless.<br><br>The trout is far downstream now, on the far side of the rip and the plunge, but the local topography makes it impossible for you to follow. The line is bellied, no longer pointing at the fish.<br><br>At some point you are struck by the knowledge that the trout -- that enormous trout -- is no longer attached to you and all your expensive tackle, though you missed the exact moment of separation. You reel in to find that he did not throw the hook but broke you off fairly against the weight of the river. You get a mental snapshot of your fly hanging in the hooked jaw of a heavy...what? A rainbow? More likely a brown. You'll never know.<br><br>Losing a fish like that is hard. Sure, you were going to release him anyway, but that's not the point. The plan was to be magnanimous in victory. You ask yourself, was it my fault? A typically analytical question. You can avoid it with poetry of the "it's just nice to be out fishing" variety, or you can soften it with the many levels of technical evasion, but there's finally only one answer: of course it was your fault, who else's fault would it be?<br><br>Your partner is out of sight and, although you would have hollered and screamed for him and his camera had you landed the fish, it's not even worth going to find him, now. When you finally meet in the course of leapfrogging down the canyon, you'll say that a while ago you executed an L.D.R. (long distance release) on a hawg, which will summarize the event as well as anything else you could say.<br><br>A trout, on this continent at least, is a rainbow, golden, brookie, brown, cutthroat, or some subspecies or hybrid of the above, though every fly-fisher is secretly delighted that the brook trout isn't a trout at all, but rather a kind of char, not that it matters.<br><br>Much is actually known about trout and much more is suspected. The serious fly-fisherman's knowledge of these fish draws heavily on science, especially the easygoing, slightly bemused, English-style naturalism of the last century, but it periodically leaves the bare facts behind to take long voyages into anthropomorphism and sheer poetry. Trout are said to be angry, curious, shy, belligerent, or whatever; or it's suggested that when one takes your Adams with a different rise form than he's using on the Blue-winged Olives, he "thought" it was a caddis fly. Cold science tells us that a trout's pea-sized brain is not capable of anything like reason or emotion. That's probably true enough, but in the defense of creative thinking, I have a comment and a question: actions speak louder than words and, if they're so dumb, how come they can be so hard to catch?<br><br>The myth of the smart trout was invented by fishermen as a kind of implied self-aggrandizement. To be unable to hook the wise old brown trout is one thing, but to be outsmarted by some slimy, cold-blooded, subreptilian creature with only the dullest glimmerings of awareness is, if not degrading, then at least something you don't want spread around. Trout are smart, boy, real smart.<br><br>The way we perceive trout is probably as faulty, from a factual standpoint, as the way they see us, but our folksy ideas about them are useful and are, in that sense, correct. If you tie a streamer fly and fish it in a way designed to make spawning brown trout "mad" and, in the course of events, manage to hook a few fish, then those fish were, by God, mad. End of discussion.<br><br>Let's say a fisheries biologist tells you that his studies, and the studies of others, demonstrate that brook trout are not piscivorous; that is, they don't eat other fish. To that you counter that you have caught countless brook trout on streamers (fish imitations), that many of the now-standard American streamer patterns were developed around the wild brook trout fisheries of the East, and that, further, fly-fishermen have believed brook trout to be fish-eaters for nigh on these many generations.<br><br>"Well," he says, "we all know brookies are stupid."<br><br>Thank you, Mister Science.<br><br>Finally, the things fishermen know about trout aren't facts but articles of faith. Brook trout may or may not eat fish, but they bite streamers. You can't even use the scientific method because the results of field testing are always suspect. There are too many variables and the next guy to come along may well prove an opposing theory beyond the shadow of a doubt.<br><br>The hatch is the Blue-winged Olive so common in the West. It's a perfect emergence from the fly-fisher's point of view: heavy enough to move all but the very largest of the trout but not so heavy that your pitiful imitation is lost in such a crowd of bugs that the surface of the stream seems fuzzy. Oh yes, hatches can be too good.<br><br>When the rise began you fished a #18 dark nymph pattern squeezed wet so it would drift just a fraction of an inch below the surface. This copies the emerging nymph at that point where it has reached the surface but has not yet hatched into the winged fly. Early on in the hatch, these are the bugs that are the most readily available to the fish, the ones they're probably taking even though at first glance it looks like they're rising to dry flies. The difference in position between an emerging nymph and a floating fly is the almost nonexistent thickness of the surface film of the water, and there is often zero difference between the trouts' rise forms.<br><br>When the hatch progresses to the point where there are more winged flies on the water than emerging nymphs, you switch to the dry fly, only a few minutes after most of the trout have. There are two mayflies on the water now, identical except that one is about a size 18 and the other, the more numerous, is more like a #22. The larger is the <i>Baetis</i> and the smaller is the <i>Pseudocloeon.</i> You heard that from the local expert and looked up the spellings in <i>Hatches,</i> by Caucci and Nastasi. It sounds good, but what it means is that you fish either the Blue-winged Olive or the Adams in a size 20, to split the difference.<br><br>The fish are an almost uniform 14 to 16 inches -- rainbows with a strong silvery cast to them, bodies fatter than most stream fish, with tiny little heads. They are wild and healthy, and you would drive five times farther than you did to fish here.<br><br>They're rising everywhere now. In the slower water they're dancing and darting, suspending for a few seconds now and then as if to catch their breath. They will move several inches for your fly, taking it matter-of-factly, completely fooled, but leaving you only a single, precise instant that won't be too early or too late to strike. This has you wound up like the E string on a pawn shop guitar.<br><br>In the faster water they are all but invisible, but they're out there because there are enough bugs to make them buck the current. They come up from the bottom through two feet of water, taking the fly with such grace and lack of hesitation that the little blip on the surface seems unconnected with that fluid arc of greenish, pinkish, silvery light in the riffle.<br><br>You are on, hot, wired. You've caught so many trout that the occasional missed strike is a little joke between you and the fish. This is the exception rather than the rule -- the time when everything comes together -- but it feels comfortable, like it happens all the time. A hint of greed creeps in. You would like, maybe, a little bigger trout, and to that end you work the far bank. Still, though the trout are now almost part of a process rather than individual victories, you admire each one momentarily before releasing it and going confidently for another.<br><br>It's late in the hatch now. Most of the river is in shadow, and the remaining light has a golden, autumnal cast to it. The little rusty-brownish spinners could come on now. This could last. But it's too perfect; it <i>can't</i> last.<br><br>Trout are wonderfully hydrodynamic creatures who can dart and hover in currents in which we humans have trouble just keeping our footing. They are torpedo shaped, designed for moving water, and behave like eye witnesses say U.F.O.s do, with sudden stops from high speeds, ninety-degree turns, such sudden accelerations that they seem to just vanish. They seem delicate at times but will turn around and flourish in conditions that look impossibly harsh. They like things clean and cold.<br><br>They are brilliantly, often outrageously, colored (the wild ones, anyway) and are a pure and simple joy to behold, though they can be damned hard to see in the water. Even the most gorgeously colored fish are as dark and mottled on the back as the finest U.S. Army-issue jungle camouflage to hide them from predators from above: herons, kingfishers, ospreys, and -- only recently in evolutionary terms -- you and me. Then there are those rare times when the light and everything else is just right, when they're as exposed as birds in the sky, in open water under bright sun as if they were in paradise. At such times they can look black. You feel like a voyeur, delighted with a view of something you have no right to see; but don't feel too guilty -- they'll spook at your first cast.<br><br>In one sense trout are perfectly adapted working parts of a stream, a way of turning water, sunlight, oxygen, and protein into consciousness. They feed on the aquatic insects when those bugs are active, and they all but shut down metabolically when they're not. They find glitches in the current where, even in the wildest water, they can lounge indefinitely by now and then lazily paddling a pectoral fin. They have the flawless competence that even the lower mammals have lost by getting to be too smart. They operate at the edges of things: fast and slow currents, deep and shallow water, air and stream, light and darkness, and the angler who understands that is well on his way to knowing what he's doing.<br><br>In another sense, trout are so incongruously pretty as to seem otherworldly: that metallic brightness, the pinks and oranges and yellows -- and the spots. One of the finest things about catching a trout is being able to turn it sideways and just look at it. How can so much color and vibrancy be generated by clear water, gray rocks, and brown bugs? Trout are among those creatures who are one hell of a lot prettier than they need to be. They can get you to wondering about the hidden workings of reality.<br><br>Releasing trout is a difficult idea to get hold of at first. It doesn't seem to make sense. You want the meat; you want the <i>proof.</i><br><br>In the beginning, catching a trout on a fly is one of those things you have to do before you actually come to believe it's possible. Those first maddening weeks or months with a fly rod make other fly-casters seem like the guy in the circus who can put the soles of his feet flat on the top of his head. Sure, <i>he</i> can do it. If you don't flip out and go back to the spinning rod, you eventually find that it can be done, though the gap between the first time you take trout on a fly rod and the second time can be so wide you come to wonder if it ever really happened. It's easy to lose the clarity of that initial vision. You hear it all the time: "I tried fly-fishing; couldn't get the hang of it."<br><br>You keep the early trout (anyone who doesn't is too saintly to be normal) but in time you begin to see the virtue of releasing the wild fish. The logic is infallible: if you kill him, he's gone; if you release him, he's still there. You can think of it in terms of recycling, low impact, all the properly futuristic phrases.<br><br>With some practice it's easy to do correctly. Smaller trout can be landed quickly -- the barbless hook is turned out with a practiced motion of the wrist, and it darts away, baffled but unharmed. You haven't lifted him from the water or even touched him.<br><br>Larger fish require more handling. You're careful not to lift them by the gill covers or squeeze them too much, causing internal damage. A landing net with a soft cotton-mesh bag helps. Big fish played to exhaustion on tackle that's unavoidably too light are carefully resuscitated (held gently in the current and pumped until they get their wind back and can swim off under their own steam). They seem dazed, and you know that if they were stressed too much, with too much lactic acid built up in their systems, they'll eventually die. It's something to wonder about. Some of your released fish have probably expired later, but you don't know enough about it to determine the actual medical condition of any particular one.<br><br>It begins to feel good, the heft and muscle tension of a bright, pretty, live trout held lightly in the cold water. It's like a mild electric shock without the pain. Finally, there's not even an instant of remorse when they dart away. At some point your former values change ends; the bigger the trout, the more satisfying the release. Having all but lost your taste for fish, you begin to release everything -- wild fish, stockers, stunted brook trout, whitefish, bluegills -- with an air of righteousness that pains many of those around you.<br><br>At some point you become an absolute snot about it. You are incensed that even staunch antihunters aren't bothered by the killing of fish, that vegetarians will bend the rules for seafood. This, you come to realize, is because trout are not seen as cute by the general population, though of course they are wrong. You begin to feel misunderstood.<br><br>That feeling can go on for years, and in some anglers it calcifies into the belief that killing a trout i...</p><h2>Taylor&#39;s Master Guide to Landscaping</h2><p>Developing your landscape is one of the pleasures of owning a home.

His words and music softened and inspired the most hardened hearts to believe. His was a ragged and raw faith of a pilgrim, poet, and prophet. Now more than a dozen of today&#x2019;s singers, songwriters, producers, and authors gather to share never-before-heard stories and lessons that continue to influence their music and ministries today. These lessons, gleaned from Rich&#x2019;s own struggles and pursuits, are combined with lyrics from unreleased Rich Mullins songs that will inspire longtime Mullins fans, new Christian music followers, and spiritual seekers trying to understand the reckless love of God.</p><p>A multiple Dove Award-nominated singer/ songwriter and respected author, Andrew Greer is known for his soulful folk-gospel sound, instinctively captured on his critically-acclaimed Angel Band recordings.

But the news isn't all bad.</b><br>It's accepted wisdom today that human beings have permanently damaged the natural world, causing extinction, deforestation, pollution, and of course climate change. But in <i>Inheritors of the Earth</i>, biologist Chris Thomas shows that this obscures a more hopeful truth--we're also helping nature grow and change. Human cities and mass agriculture have created new places for enterprising animals and plants to live, and our activities have stimulated evolutionary change in virtually every population of living species. Most remarkably, Thomas shows, humans may well have raised the rate at which new species are formed to the highest level in the history of our planet.<br>Drawing on the success stories of diverse species, from the ochre-colored comma butterfly to the New Zealand pukeko, Thomas overturns the accepted story of declining biodiversity on Earth. In so doing, he questions why we resist new forms of life, and why we see ourselves as unnatural. Ultimately, he suggests that if life on Earth can recover from the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs, it can survive the onslaughts of the technological age. This eye-opening book is a profound reexamination of the relationship between humanity and the natural world.</p><p><b>Chris D.

Seuss drew over 400 cartoons in just under two years for the paper, reflecting the daily's New Deal liberal slant. Starting in early 1941, when <i>PM</i> advocated American involvement in World War II, Seuss savaged the fascists with cunning caricatures. He also turned his pen against America's internal enemies--isolationists, hoarders, complainers, anti-Semites, and anti-black racists--and urged Americans to work together to win the war. The cartoons are often funny, peopled with bowler-hatted "everymen" and what author Art Spiegelman calls "Seussian fauna" in his preface. They are also often very disturbing--Seuss draws brutally racist images of the Japanese and even attacks Japanese Americans on numerous occasions. Perhaps most disturbing is the realization that Seuss was just reflecting the wartime zeitgeist.<p> <i>Dr. Seuss Goes to War</i> marks the first time most of these illustrations have appeared in print since they were first published. Richard H. Minear's introduction and explanatory chapters contextualize the 200 editorial cartoons (some of whose nuances might otherwise be lost on the modern reader). Those who grew up on Seuss will enjoy early glimpses of his later work; history buffs will enjoy this new--if playful and contorted--angle on World War II. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>One of the country&#x2019;s leading historians of Japan during World War II, <b>Richard H.

This was the downside to the blood bond I had with Eric Northman. I knew I was going to see him, and I was simply <i>happy</i> about it. I should have been worried, I should have been apprehensive about what he wanted, I should have asked a million questions about the velvet-wrapped bundle, but I just drove with a smile on my face.</p><p>Though I couldn&#x2019;t help how I felt, I could control my actions. Out of sheer perversity, since no one had told me to come around to the employees&#x2019; entrance, I entered through the main door. It was a busy night at Fangtasia, and there was a waiting crowd on benches inside the first set of doors. Pam was at the podium. She smiled at me broadly, showing a little fang. (The crowd was delighted.)</p><p>I&#x2019;d known Pam for a while now, and she was as close to a friend as I had among the vampires. Tonight the blonde vampire was wearing the obligatory filmy black dress, and she&#x2019;d camped it up with a long, sheer black veil. Her white fingernails were polished scarlet. </p><p>&#x201c;My friend,&#x201d; Pam said, came out from behind the podium to hug me. I was surprised but pleased, and gladly hugged her back. She&#x2019;d spritzed on a little perfume to eclipse the faint, rather dry, smell of vampire. &#x201c;Have you got it?&#x201d; she whispered in my ear.</p>&#x201c;Oh, the bundle? It&#x2019;s in my purse.&#x201d; I lifted my big brown shoulder bag by its straps. <p>Pam gave me a look I couldn&#x2019;t interpret through the veil. It appeared to be an expression that compounded exasperation and affection. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t even look inside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had time,&#x201d; I said. It wasn&#x2019;t that I hadn&#x2019;t been curious. I simply hadn&#x2019;t had the leisure to think about it. </p> <p>Pam gave me a long look of appraisal. &#x201c;Go back to Eric&#x2019;s office and hand him the bundle,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Leave it wrapped. No matter who&#x2019;s there. And don&#x2019;t handle it like it was a garden tool he&#x2019;d left outside, either.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave her the look right back. &#x201c;What am I doing, Pam?&#x201d; I asked, jumping on the cautious train way too late. </p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re protecting your own skin,&#x201d; Pam said. &#x201c;Never doubt it. Now go.&#x201d; She gave me a get-along pat on the back, and turned to answer a tourist&#x2019;s question about how often vampires needed to get their teeth cleaned.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like to come very close and look at mine?&#x201d; Pam asked in a sultry voice, and the woman shrieked with delighted fear. That was why the humans come to vampire bars, and vampire comedy clubs, and vampire dry cleaners, and vampire casinos . . . to flirt with danger.</p><p>Every now and then, flirtation becomes the real thing.</p><p>I made my way between the tables and across the dance floor to the rear of the bar. Felicia, the bartender, looked unhappy when she saw me. She found something to do that involved crouching down out of my sight. I had an unfortunate history with the bartenders of Fantasia.</p><p>There were a few vampires seated throughout the bar area, strewn among the gawking tourists, the costumed vampire wannabes, and humans who had business dealings with the vamps. Over in the little souvenir shop, one of the New Orleans vampire refugees from Katrina was selling a Fangtasia T shirt to a pair of giggling girls.</p> <p>I walked through the bar and knocked on Eric&#x2019;s door. I heard his voice inside, telling me to come in. I stepped inside and shut the door behind me. &#x201c;Hi, Eric,&#x201d; I said, and was almost rendered mute by the surge of happiness that swept through me whenever I saw him. His long blond hair was braided tonight, and he was wearing his favorite jeans-and-a-T combo. The T shirt tonight was bright green, making him look whiter than ever.</p><p>The wave of delight wasn&#x2019;t necessarily related to Eric&#x2019;s gorgeousness or the fact that we&#x2019;d bumped pelvises, though. The blood bond was responsible, and I had to fight the feeling.</p><p>Maybe.</p> <p>Victor Madden, representative of the new vampire king, Felipe de Castro, stood and inclined his curly dark head. Victor, short and compact, was always polite and always well-dressed. This evening he was especially resplendent in an olive suit and brown striped tie. I smiled at him and was about to tell him I was glad to see him again when I noticed that Eric was eyeing me expectantly. Oh, right.</p><p>I shucked off my coat and extracted the velvet bundle from my purse. I dropped the purse and coat in an empty chair, and walked over to Eric&#x2019;s desk with the bundle extended in both hands. This was making as much of the moment as I could, short of getting on my knees and crawling over to Eric, which I would do when hell froze over.</p><p>I laid the bundle in front of him, inclined my own head in what I hoped was a ceremonious manner, and sat down in the other guest chair. </p> <p>&#x201c;What has our fair-haired friend brought you, Eric?&#x201d; Victor asked, in the cheerful voice that he affected most of the time. Maybe he was actually that happy, or maybe his mama had taught him (a few centuries ago) that you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.</p><p>With a certain sense of theater, Eric silently unfolded the velvet. Sparkling like a jewel on the dark material was the ceremonial knife I&#x2019;d last seen in the city of Rhodes. Eric had used it when he officiated at the marriage of two vampire kings, and he&#x2019;d used it to nick himself later when he&#x2019;d taken blood from me and given me blood in return; our third exchange, the one that (from my point of view) had caused all the trouble.</p><p>After Victor recognized the knife, there was no trace of a smile remaining on his face. He and Eric regarded each other steadily.</p><p>&#x201c;Very interesting,&#x201d; Victor said finally. </p><p>Once again, I had that feeling of drowning when I hadn&#x2019;t even known I was in the pool. I started to speak, but I could feel Eric&#x2019;s will pressing on me, urging me to be silent. In vampire matters, it was smart to take Eric&#x2019;s advice.</p></p><h2>The Forgotten Arts and Crafts</h2><p>This text brings together in a single volume two best-selling classics, &#34;The Forgotten Arts&#34; and &#34;The Forgotten Household Crafts&#34;. Taking the reader on an evocative journey through the worlds of traditional craftspeople, Seymour celebrates their honest skills.</p><p>Originally published in two separate volumes (<i>The Forgotten Arts</i> and <i>Forgotten Household Crafts</i>), this book brings under one cover the wisdom of John Seymour, a well-known thinker on matters of self-sufficiency, traditional arts, and voluntary simplicity. Seymour is a utopian--he has a vision of a better world where people aren't alienated from their labors. In the introduction he writes, "Are we justified in using articles, no matter how convenient it may be for us to use them, that we know were produced in conditions which bored and even stultified the human beings who had to make them?" This question led Seymour to the research that forms the foundation of the book: rediscovering natural ways of making tools, shoes, furniture, and a variety of other items using methods that follow the grain of wood or the idiosyncrasies of a piece of stone. Seymour respects what he calls "the discipline of natural materials," and he longs for a world free of "mass produced rubbish." Chapters cover an astonishing range: from clog making to spinning to canning. Since this book is intended as a comprehensive survey, don't expect to be an expert on, say, forging metal by reading Seymour's descriptions. He doesn't go into great detail; rather, he gives the basic facts of each forgotten labor of love, and it's up to readers to decide if it's a labor they want to undertake. <i>--Emily White</i>John Seymour was born in England in 1914. As a young man, he traveled all over Africa and fought in Burma in World War II. Returning penniless to England, he lived in a bus and a sailing barge before settling on five acres of land in the country to lead a self-sufficient life. He continues this lifestyle today with his companion Angela Ashe on the banks of the River Barrow in County Wexford, Ireland. The two have build up a small farm from scratch over the last 19 years. For the last four years, John, Angela, and William Sutherland have been running courses in self-sufficiency from their home at Killowen, New Ross. The courses are taken by students from al over the world, who come to Killowen to learn about John&#39;s lifestyle and philosophy at first hand. John Seymour is the author of over 40 books, including the best-selling Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency, and he has made numerous movies and radio programs. Most of his later writings and public campaigning have been devoted to rural matters, self-sufficiency, and the environment.</p><h2>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book</h2><p>The very idea that the teachings can be mastered will arouse controversy within Buddhist circles. Even so, Ingram insists that enlightenment is an attainable goal, once our fanciful notions of it are stripped away, and we have learned to use meditation as a method for examining reality rather than an opportunity to wallow in self-absorbed mind-noise. Ingram sets out concisely the difference between concentration-based and insight (vipassana) meditation; he provides example practices; and most importantly he presents detailed maps of the states of mind we are likely to encounter, and the stages we must negotiate as we move through clearly-defined cycles of insight. Its easy to feel overawed, at first, by Ingram&#39;s assurance and ease in the higher levels of consciousness, but consistently he writes as a down-to-earth and compassionate guide, and to the practitioner willing to commit themselves this is a glittering gift of a book.</p><p>Daniel M. Ingram began entering into classical meditation territory as a teenager quite by accident and without knowing it crossed into territory that he would later call various names, including The Dark Night and the Knowledges of Suffering. He had no idea what had happened, but somehow knew that he had to find something. After being inspired by a good friend who got to the first stage of enlightenment after a retreat in centers in the Buddhist tradition, he began going on intensive insight meditation retreats in the US, India and Malaysia. By simply following the instructions he achieved the expected results, and has since become part of the global movement of meditation reform, a movement that seeks to preserve core meditation technology and supports, integrate helpful aspects from across traditions, refine the techniques and maps through exploration and verification, and spread the message that it can be done. It is also a movement to strip away the aspects of dogma, ritual,rigid hierarchy, myth and falsehood that hinder high-level practice and keep the culture of meditation mired in unhelpful taboos and misplaced effort. Dr. Ingram also has an MD, a Master&#39;s degree in Public Health, and a bachelor&#39;s degree in English literature. He practices in the U.S. as a board-certified emergency medicine physician. He hopes that those on the path will practice well, aim high and become accomplished practitioners who will help to train others to do the same.</p><h2>The Great Waldo Search</h2><p>In his third adventure, the intrepid striped-shirted hero visit&#39;s a series of fantastic lands where--elusive as ever--he is tracked by all kinds of people and things</p><p>Following Where's Waldo? and Find Waldo Now , the search for Waldo continues. Here, in 12 large, amazingly busy panels Waldo, in hallmark hat and red-striped sweater, travels through a diverse series of land- and seascapes. The reader is set the tasks of finding Waldo and helping him locate 12 scrolls. Over volcanic terrain, Waldo traipses past scores of battling monks; he visits "the Castle of the Nasty Nasties" populated by vampires and witches; and he meets deep-sea divers (wearing striped Waldo-colored trunks), and mermaids and monsters of the deep. In the final and most challenging panel, Waldo is in a land of Waldos--hundreds of them, and readers must identify the real Waldo.

Starting as little more than a talking jukebox, the DJ is now a premier entertainer, producer, businessman, and musician in his own right. Superstar DJs, from Junior Vasquez to Sasha and Digweed, command worship and adoration from millions, flying around the globe to earn tens of thousands of dollars for one night&#39;s work. Increasingly, they are replacing live musicians as the central figures of the music industry. In Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, music journalists Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton have written the first comprehensive history of the mysterious and charismatic figure behind the turntables -- part obsessive record collector, part mad scientist, part intuitive psychologist of the party groove. From England&#39;s rabid Northern Soul scene to the birth of disco in New York, from the sound systems of Jamaica to the scratch wars of early hip-hop in the Bronx, from Chicago house to Detroit techno to London rave, DJs are responsible for most of the significant changes in music over the past forty years. Drawing on in-depth interviews with DJs, critics, musicians, record executives, and the revelers at some of the century&#39;s most legendary parties, Last Night a DJ Saved My Life is nothing less than the life story of dance music.</p><p>The DJ has been at the center of music history for the last forty years-from the first time a record was played over the airwaves, through reggae and Northern Soul, the births of disco, hip hop, house, and techno, to the current global underground.

Last Night a DJ Saved My Life is the first comprehensive history of the disc jockey, a figure who has revolutionized the way music is conceived, created, and consumed. Drawing on in-depth interviews with the world's most important DJs and the revelers at some of the century's most legendary parties, this book is nothing less than the life story of dance music. <p>"Brewster and Broughton...have written a lively and--to anyone with a more than casual interest in the history of popular music in the latter half of the 20th century--necessary volume."--The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"A riveting look at record spinning from its beginnings to the present day, the authors show that the history and art of deejaying makes for a grander and more fascinating story than one would think.....

An illuminating, thoughtful, and insightful tome."--Muzik </p><p>Excerpts Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: </p><p>"Today (no offense to priests and ministers, who try their best), it is the DJ who presides at our festivals of transcendence. Like this witchdoctor, we know he's just a normal guy really--I mean, look at him--but when he wipes away our everyday lives with holy drums and sanctified basslines, we are quite prepared to think of him as a god, or at the very least a sacred intermediary, the man who can get the great one to return our calls. </p><p>"In a good club, and even in most bad ones, the dancers are celebrating their youth, their energy, their sexuality. They are worshipping life through dance and music. Some worship with the heightened levels of perception that drugs bring; but most are carried away merely by the music and the people around them. The DJ is the key to all this. By playing records in the right way the average DJ has a tremendous power to affect people's states of mind. A truly great DJ, just for a moment, can make a whole room fall in love. Because, you see, DJing is not just about choosing a few tunes. It's about generating shared moods; it's about understanding the feelings of a group of people and directing them to a better place. In the hands of a master, records become the tools for rituals of spiritual communion that for many people are the most powerful events in their lives." </p><p>Bill Brewster has been editor of Mixmag's Update USA.

Through her research, Dr. Rankin discovered that the health care she had been taught to practice was missing something crucial: a recognition of the body&#x2019;s innate ability to self-repair and an appreciation for how we can control these self-healing mechanisms with the power of the mind. To better understand this phenomenon, she explored peer-reviewed medical literature and found evidence that the medical establishment had been proving that the body can heal itself for over 50 years. Using extraordinary cases of spontaneous healing, Dr. Rankin shows how thoughts, feelings, and beliefs can alter the body&#x2019;s physiology. She lays out the scientific data proving that loneliness, pessimism, depression, fear, and anxiety damage the body, while intimate relationships, gratitude, meditation, sex, and authentic self-expression flip on the body&#x2019;s self-healing processes. In this book, you&#x2019;ll find a radical new wellness model based on Dr. Rankin&#x2019;s scientific findings. Her unique six-step program will help you uncover where things might be out of whack in your life&#x2014;spiritually, creatively, environmentally, nutritionally, and in your professional and personal relationships&#x2014;so that you can create a customized treatment plan aimed at bolstering these health-promoting pieces of your life. You&#x2019;ll learn how to listen to your body&#x2019;s "whispers" before they turn to life-threatening "screams" that can be prevented with proper self-care, and you&#x2019;ll learn how to trust your inner guidance when making decisions about your health and your life. By the time you finish Mind Over Medicine, you&#x2019;ll have made your own Diagnosis, written your own Prescription, and created a clear action plan designed to help you make your body ripe for miracles.</p><p>Lissa Rankin, M.D., is a physician, author, speaker, teacher, and founder of the Whole Health Medicine Institute.

Langer<br><br> A rosewood paperweight on my desk bears a sterling silver plaque declaring: Great results begin with great questions. It was a gift from a very special person in my life&#x2014;Joseph S. Edwards&#x2014;who introduced me to Question Thinking, or QT, as he called the skills he taught me. QT opened up a part of my mind that otherwise I might never have discovered. Like everyone else, I believed the way to fix a problem was to look for the right answers. Instead, Joseph showed me that the best way to solve a problem is to first come up with better questions. The skills he taught me rescued my career and saved my marriage as well. Both were definitely in trouble at the time.<br><br> It all started when I was invited to take a position at QTec. The company was in the midst of a major overhaul at the time, and the word on the street was that, barring a miracle, they would fold before the year was out. A friend warned me that accepting a position with QTec would be like signing up to crew on a sinking ship. What convinced me to take the risk? It was my trust in Alexa Harte, the recently appointed CEO at QTec, who&#x2019;d offered me the position. I&#x2019;d worked with her for years at KB Corp., my previous employer, where she&#x2019;d won my respect as a gifted leader. Her confidence about turning QTec around was infectious. Besides, she promised me a great promotion: hefty pay raise, impressive title, and a chance to lead a team in developing an innovative new product. If everything went well the risk would pay off in aces. If not . . . well, I tried not to think about that.<br><br> At first I was riding high, convinced I had the job wired. Alexa had hired me for my technology and engineering smarts, and I knew I could deliver on that count. The new product really intrigued me, and the technical challenges were right up my alley. At KB&#x2014;where Alexa said she&#x2019;d seen me work miracles&#x2014;I&#x2019;d won accolades as the Answer Man. I&#x2019;d faced down the toughest technical problems, one right after the other. However, at QTec I was also facing a different kind of challenge&#x2014;heading up a high-stakes, high-visibility team. I was excited about taking this on, although Alexa had let me know I&#x2019;d have to put effort into developing my people and leadership skills.<br><br> My team seemed an enthusiastic and talented bunch, and for a while everything went well. Then life at QTec started unraveling. It was as if suddenly a glaring spotlight was focused on my shortcomings. I didn&#x2019;t dare say it, but secretly I concluded I&#x2019;d been stuck with a bunch of losers.<br><br> To make matters worse, there was Charles. Before I came aboard at QTec he&#x2019;d been passed over for the job I&#x2019;d been offered. I could understand why he might resent me. And, just as I expected, he was a real troublemaker from the word go, questioning everything I said and did.<br><br> Things went from bad to worse. If the QTec ship wasn&#x2019;t actually sinking, as my friend had warned me was happening, it was definitely taking on water, and I had no idea how to plug up the leaks. My team meetings became a farce&#x2014;no discussions, no solutions, and no sense of teamwork. And nobody had to remind me that if we couldn&#x2019;t get our product to market before the competition, we would prove the naysayers right.<br><br> Life wasn&#x2019;t much better at home. Tension was growing with Grace, my wonderful wife of less than eight months. She constantly asked me about what was going on at work. Finally, one day I just told her she was asking too many questions and she should keep her nose out of my business. She was hurt, I was miserable, and I hadn&#x2019;t the vaguest idea what to do about it.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t want Grace to know how much difficulty I was having. I&#x2019;d always taken great pride in solving problems that baffled everyone else. This time, with any luck, the right answers would turn up before Grace, Alexa, and the people on my team found out that the job was way over my head. Meanwhile I kept more and more to myself and did my best to just get through each day.<br><br> I was mystified and overwhelmed. It seemed like everything in my life was falling apart. Then came the awful turning point. Grace and I had an argument in the morning, and only hours later there was a major crisis at work. Nobody said it, but I could see it in their eyes: we were cooked.<br><br> This was my moment of truth. I needed to be alone and face facts. I called Grace and left a message that I&#x2019;d be putting in an all-nighter to finish an important report. Then I spent the whole long night in my office, staring at the walls, still searching desperately for the right answers and reliving the most disastrous weeks of my life. I told myself I had to face the truth: I had failed. Just after six that morning I went out for coffee and then started drafting my resignation. I finished three hours later, called Alexa, and made arrangements to see her immediately.<br><br> The walk to Alexa&#x2019;s suite was less than a hundred yards. That morning it felt like a hundred miles. When I got to the big double doors of her office I stopped and took a deep breath to regain my composure. I stood there for some long moments, working up the nerve to knock. Just as I was raising my arm, I heard a voice behind me.<br><br> &#x201c;Ben Knight, you&#x2019;re here. Good, good!&#x201d;<br><br> It was Alexa. There was no mistaking that voice, always cheerful, exuding a sense of optimism even when things were going badly. An attractive, athletic-looking woman in her late 40s, she radiated confidence. I&#x2019;d told Grace that I&#x2019;d never met anyone quite like Alexa. She approached her responsibilities at QTec with boundless enthusiasm. It wasn&#x2019;t that she didn&#x2019;t take her job seriously. She took it very seriously! And she did it with such pleasure and self-assurance that she made it look easy.<br><br> At that moment, her mere presence made me acutely aware of my deficiencies. I felt numb, barely mumbling a subdued good morning as she touched my shoulder and ushered me into her office.<br><br> The room was expansive, the size of a large living room in the best executive home. I crossed deep green carpeting, soft underfoot, and walked over to the large bay window where the meeting area was set up. There, two overstuffed sofas faced each other across a large walnut coffee table.<br><br> &#x201c;Sit!&#x201d; Alexa said, gesturing in a welcoming way to one of the couches.&#x201d; Betty said your lights were on when she left her office at seven-thirty last night, and you were here when she came in early this morning.&#x201d;<br><br> She sat down across from me on the other couch.<br><br> &#x201c;I presume that&#x2019;s for me?&#x201d; Alexa asked, pointing to the green folder containing my resignation that I&#x2019;d placed on the coffee table.<br><br> I nodded, waiting for her to pick it up. Instead, she leaned back, looking as if she had all the time in the world.<br><br> &#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s going on with you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> I pointed to the green folder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my resignation. I&#x2019;m sorry, Alexa.&#x201d;<br><br> The next sound I heard stopped me cold. It was not a gasp, not a word of reproach, but laughter! It was not cruel laughter, either. What had I missed? I didn&#x2019;t understand. How could Alexa still sound sympathetic in the face of all I&#x2019;d screwed up?<br><br> &#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not going to quit on me.&#x201d; She slid the folder in my direction. &#x201c;Take this back. I know more about your situation than you realize. I want you to give me at least a few months. But for that period of time, you&#x2019;ve got to commit to making changes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you sure about this?&#x201d; I asked, dumbfounded.<br><br> &#x201c;Let me answer you this way,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Many years ago, I was in a situation similar to yours. I had to face facts. If I wanted to be successful I&#x2019;d need to make some fundamental changes. I was pretty desperate. A man by the name of Joseph sat me down and asked some straightforward questions, simple ones on the surface. But those questions opened doors I never even knew existed. He asked, &#x2018;Are you willing to take responsibility for your mistakes&#x2014; and for the attitudes and actions that led to them?&#x2019; Then he said, &#x2018;Are you willing&#x2014;however begrudgingly&#x2014;to forgive yourself, and even laugh at yourself?&#x2019; And finally, &#x2018;Will you look for value in your experiences, especially the most difficult ones?&#x2019; Bottom line: &#x2018;Are you willing to learn from what happened and make changes accordingly?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> She went on to tell me how Joseph&#x2019;s work with her, and the methods he had developed over the years, had changed not only her life but her husband Stan&#x2019;s as well.&#x201d; Stan has more than tripled his net worth in the past few years. He attributes the success he and his company enjoy today to what Joseph taught him. Joseph will probably tell you all about it. He loves to tell stories, especially ones about how people&#x2019;s lives were changed by changing their questions.&#x201d;<br><br> I must have looked perplexed because she added, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about what I mean by questions that change people&#x2019;s lives. You&#x2019;ll learn about that soon enough.&#x201d; She paused. Then, in carefully measured words, she said, &#x201c;I want you to work with my friend Joseph, starting immediately. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll want to meet with you over a period of time. Figure out the schedule with him. This is top priority now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What is he, a therapist?&#x201d; The idea of seeing a shrink made me nervous.<br><br> Alexa smiled. &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s an executive coach. I call him an inquiring coach.&#x201d;<br><br> Inquiring coach! If I knew anything at all, it was that I needed answers, not more questions. How could more questions possibly benefit me or pull me out the hole I was in?<br><br> As I was getting ready to leave, Alexa jotted something down on a piece of paper and sealed it in an envelope. &#x201c;Inside this envelope is a prediction I&#x2019;ve made,&#x201d; she said mysteriously, handing it to me. &#x201c;Put it in that green folder of yours and don&#x2019;t open it until you&#x2019;ve completed your work with Joseph and I tell you it&#x2019;s the time to open it.&#x201d; Then she gave me Joseph&#x2019;s business card. I turned it over. There was a big question mark on the other side. It really irritated me. The idea that I&#x2019;d be spending valuable time with a man whose logo was a question mark went against everything I believed.<br><br> Back in my own office, I collapsed in the chair behind my desk. My eyes fell on a small gilded frame on the wall. It held a saying, just two words long: Question everything! It was a quote attributed to Albert Einstein. Many rooms at QTec contained a framed placard exactly like this one. As much as I respected and appreciated Alexa&#x2019;s leadership, this message had always been a point of contention for me. Everybody knows that leaders should have answers, not questions.<br><br> My eyes were fixed on Joseph&#x2019;s card with the question mark on the back. What had I gotten myself into? Only time would tell. At least I could put off my decision to resign. My attention shifted to Grace. How was I ever going to smooth things over with her? At that moment there was only one thing to be grateful for&#x2014;Alexa hadn&#x2019;t asked about Grace and me. I think that would have been the last straw. I knew Alexa was fond of my wife&#x2014;she&#x2019;d even come to our wedding. She wouldn&#x2019;t have been happy to find out we were having trouble.<br><br> I sat there for a long time just staring at Joseph&#x2019;s card. The fact that Alexa had refused to accept my resignation offered a little hope. I was encouraged that she would refer me to her own mentor&#x2014;even though the jury was still out on whether her trust in me was justified. Still, I had nothing to lose by keeping an appointment with this inquiring coach guy. Besides, even though I was skeptical, I was also curious. If this Joseph guy had helped Alexa and Stan so much, maybe he had answers that would help me, too.<br><br> &#x201c;Question everything!&#x201d;<br><br> Albert Einstein</p><h2>A People&#39;s History of the World</h2><p>Spine creased.

("New York Times Book Review")</p><h2>Leaving My Father&#39;s House</h2><p>The life stories of three women--Kate, a professor&#39;s wife; Mary, a dancer; and Rita, a sculptor--provide clear examples of the individuation process of women in a patriarchal society.</p><p>Marion Woodman is a Jungian analyst who is internationally known as a teacher, lecturer, and workshop leader. She is the author of numerous books, including <i>Addiction to Perfection </i>and <i>Leaving My Father's House. </i>A notable contribution to the understanding of women's development, as leading Jungian analyst Woodman comments on and provides a theoretical framework for personal accounts by three of her clients. The first-person stories by these clients--Kate Danson, Mary Hamilton, and Rita Greer Allen--make up the major part of the book. Culled by the women from hundreds of pages of their journals, the narratives demonstrate with immediacy and in moving detail the paths by which women of varied backgrounds and experiences arrive at what Woodman terms ``conscious femininity.'' But what makes this different from the many similiar Jungian-oriented books of recent years is the compelling voice in each story. Danson, a graduate student, undergoes an emotional crisis following an abortion, resulting in a shift of focus from family to academic life. Hamilton, a dancer, engages in a series of dialogues with powerful inner figures emerging from her dreams. Allen, a sculptor and filmmaker, begins her inner work at age 72 and encounters serious physical illness in the course of renewing the sources of her creativity. The backdrop to all this is Woodman's interpretation of a little-known Grimm's fairy tale, ``Allerleirauh,'' and her explication of the women's processes of ``individuation'' in terms of archetypal motifs suggested by the fairy tale. Woodman's emphasis is on the imperative for women to discount external cultural demands (the dictates of the patriarchy, the Father's House of the title) and to step into the unfamiliar territory of inner symbols and symptoms in order to transform themselves and their relationships. Lively and fascinating despite Woodman's somewhat repetitive use of popularized Jungianisms (``inner feminine,'' ``inner masculine,'' etc.). The women's narratives speak eloquently for themselves. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Possessed of enormous talent and ambition, these two artists -- one trained as a sculptor, the other as a stonecutter -- met as contemporaries in the building yards of St. Peter's in Rome and ended their lives as bitter enemies. Over the course of their careers they became the most celebrated architects of their era, designing some of the most beautiful buildings in the world and transforming the city of Rome.</p><p><strong>The Genius in the Design</strong> is an extraordinary tale of how these two men plotted, schemed, and intrigued to get the better of each other. Full of dramatic tension and great insight into personalities, acclaimed writer Jake Morrissey's engrossing and impeccably researched account also shows that this legendary rivalry defined the Baroque style that immediately succeeded the Renaissance and created the spectacular Roman cityscape of today.</p><p>Almost exactly the same age -- Bernini was born at the end of 1598, Borromini nine months later -- they were as alike and as different as any two men could be, each a potent combination of passion and enterprise, energy and imperfection. Bernini was a precocious talent who as a youth caught the attention of Pope Paul V and became Rome's most celebrated artist, whose patrons included the wealthiest families in Europe. The city's greatest sculptor -- the creator of such masterpieces as Apollo and Daphne and the Ecstasy of St. Teresa -- Bernini would also have been Rome's preeminent architect had it not been for Francesco Borromini, the one man whose talent and virtuosity rivaled his own. In contrast to Bernini's easy grace, Borromini was an introvert with a fiery temper who bristled when anyone interfered with his vision; his temperament alienated him from prospective patrons and precipitated his tragic end.</p><p>Like Mozart and Salieri, these two masters were inextricably linked, their dazzling work prodding the other to greater achievement while taking merciless advantage of each other's missteps. <strong>The Genius in the Design</strong> is their story, a fascinating narrative of beauty and tragedy marked at turns by personal animosity and astonishing artistic achievement.</p></p><p><p>Jake Morrissey has studied and written about architecture for twenty years. His work has appeared in the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and dozens of other publications and books. He is the author of the novel <em>A Weekend at Blenheim</em> and lives near New York City.</p>Sometimes plodding but often entertaining, this dual biography of two Italian Baroque artists popularizes a tale familiar to art historians. Raised in a wealthy family with connections to politicians and cultural players, Bernini (1598&#x2013;1680) was 12 when he was commissioned to do his first major piece&#x2014;and he soon learned how to win the hearts and pocketbooks of rich patrons on his own. Borromini (1599&#x2013;1667) lacked such connections, but climbed the guild's ladder, eventually becoming chief assistant to Carlo Maderno, the chief architect of St. Peter's. When Maderno died in 1629, Borromini was shocked that Bernini was named chief. Morrissey (<i>A Weekend at Blenheim</i>) finely renders the intense rivalry between these two artists, giving a reasonable if fact-heavy look at 17th-century Roman life in the process. Borromini elected to work for Bernini, but tensions soon led to a break; Bernini went on to complete the <i>Scala Regia</i> and the <i>Cathedra Petri</i>; Borromini found fewer and fewer commissions and eventually killed himself. The book doesn't do justice to the varying levels of ambition, engagement and achievement Morrissey finds in these figures, but it does an adequate job sketching their contours. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Milo woke up before sunrise, tucked his fifty-year-old self into a pair of shorts, and walked out to meditate on the beach. His dog, Burt &#x2013; a big black mutt -- followed.</p><p>Milo sat down in the sugar-white sand, closed his eyes, and felt the warm, salt breeze in his beard. He took note of his ponytail feathering against his back, and seagulls crying. That&#x2019;s what you were supposed to do when you meditated: <i>notice</i> things, without really thinking about them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo was not a particularly good meditator. He cracked open a beer, and watched the sun come up. Meanwhile, as always, the more he tried to think of nothing, the more he thought of ridiculous, noisy shit like his big toe, or France. Maybe he would get a new tattoo.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drank his breakfast, noticing the ocean, welcoming its ancient indifference. He tried to match its breath &#x2013; the breath of time itself -- and fell asleep, as usual, on the beach with his beer and his dog, until the tide rolled in far enough to wet the sand under his ankles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, perhaps, the crappiest meditator in the world. But he noticed this, accepted it, and let it humble him. Humility was one of the things that made him a wise man.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked back to the house to open a new bag of dog food.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shark that would eat Milo in a few hours was miles away, at that particular moment. It patrolled the surf off St. Jeffrye&#x2019;s Key, looking for manatees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shark knew it was hungry. This required no thought. The shark lived in the moment, every moment, in a perfect equanimity of sense and peace, meditating its way through the sea without even trying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo worked in his garden for a while.</p><p>He played with his dog and read a book about fossils.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went online and spent twenty minutes watching dumb videos. </p><p>Then he drove his old pickup truck to St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, because visiting the sick is an important part of a wise man&#x2019;s job. He took Burt with him.</p><p>Petting dogs was good for people; it was a scientific fact. Burt was a wise man too, in his way. All animals are.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this particular day, Milo and Burt visited Ms. Arlene Epstein, who was dying of being a hundred years old. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was asleep when Milo arrived, and he stood there looking at her for a minute. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals had an unfortunate way of reducing people, he thought. Looking at Arlene Epstein in her bed, tissue-delicate, you&#x2019;d never know that she had once been a legendary bartender, keeping rowdy tourists in line with a sawed-off hockey stick. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burt hopped up and rested his forepaws on the mattress.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Milo,&#x201d; yawned Arlene. &#x201c;Is it Thursday already?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Saturday,&#x201d; he answered, kneeling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I always liked Saturdays,&#x201d; mused Arlene. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll die on a Saturday, if I can help it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not today, though,&#x201d; said Milo. &#x201c;You look good.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; she replied, sitting up and giving his beard a tug. &#x201c;You can take me for a walk.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arlene was not supposed to go for walks. There was a sticker on her door that said she was a &#x2018;fall risk.&#x2019; Milo ignored the sticker, and stole a walker from a closet down the hall.</p><p>Arlene took one step about every three seconds. Milo stuck casually by her side, ready like a hair-trigger to catch her. Burt walked along the wall, sniffing like crazy (dogs love hospitals. Think of all the different smells you can never quite get rid of).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they had traveled ten feet, Arlene asked, &#x201c;Milo, do you know what happens when we die?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was honest with her. He said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One step. Two steps. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You come back as something else.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arlene thought about that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Like another person?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Or a dog. Or an ant. Maybe even a tree. Burt was a bus driver in his last life.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman stopped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fuck with me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to die soon, on a Saturday, and I want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo looked down at her with deep, honest eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lived almost ten thousand lives,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;I am the oldest soul on the planet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arlene looked into one of his eyes, then the other. Seemed to like what she saw. She set the walker aside, took Milo&#x2019;s hand with both of hers, and leaned on him some.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They resumed walking.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Will I still be <i>me?&#x201d;</i> she asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Milo. &#x201c;More or less. Of course, you&#x2019;re supposed to make improvements.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think I want to come back as a tree.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arlene patted his hand and told him he was a good boy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burt sniffed out something nasty on the floor, and gave it a big, fat lick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Milo had gone out swimming then and been eaten by the shark, it would have been a wonderful, generous note for his life to end on. But he didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shark, always hungry, had eaten a mess of ocean perch and some floating garbage, and now cruised the deeps between islands, coming up slowly across the outer reefs of Orange Blossom Key. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shark had <i>been</i> an ocean perch, in a former life. It had been food of all kinds. It had been the Strawberry Queen for the 1985 Strawberry Festival in Troy, Ohio. Sometimes, in dreams, it remembered these other lives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, though, it swam and was hungry, and swam and was hungry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo still had his workday to look forward to. Part of being a wise man was knowing the importance of work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo did two things for a living.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thing One: he was a fisherman, and a sportfishing guide. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He owned a boat called the <i>Jenny Ann Loudermilk</i>, and charged people a fortune to catch fish. You could charge tourists in the keys practically anything. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Milo&#x2019;s workday involved housecleaning aboard the <i>Loudermilk. </i>Maybe a customer would appear, but he kind of hoped not. He was hoping to go surfing, if the waves built up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood on the deck of his boat, wielding a garden hose, spraying away seagull shit and old fish guts. Burt curled up on the floor in the pilot house and lay there watching the flies on the windshield.</p><p>Milo thought about Arlene Epstein and wondering if she was scared.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hoped not. Death was a door. You went through it over and over, but it still terrified people. That&#x2019;s what he was thinking about when something bright and colorful caught his eye, down on the dock.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tourist, in an Orange Blossom Key t-shirt. A chunky man of middle years, wearing a mustache, sunglasses, brand-new boat shoes, and a straw hat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Milo didn&#x2019;t feel like working that afternoon. Suddenly he just wanted to head for BoBo&#x2019;s Pub, and sit at the bar and drink beer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you going out again today?&#x201d; asked the tourist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aw, great balls of shit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The customer&#x2019;s always right,&#x201d; said Milo. &#x201c;You want to go out, we&#x2019;ll go out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How much?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo quoted his fee, which staggered the man. (O, shining hope...)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; said Milo, &#x201c;you get three or four other fellas, it&#x2019;s easier on your wallet, and we could go out and hit it tomorrow morning --&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the tourist seemed to be in the grip of some urgency. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go ahead and go.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hop aboard,&#x201d; said Milo, offering a strong, tanned, tattooed hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tourist introduced himself as Floyd Gamertsfelder.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I sell carpet,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s awesome,&#x201d; said Milo, casting off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burt jumped ship and trotted away down the dock, heading home. He didn&#x2019;t belong out on the water, and he knew it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Floyd Gamertsfelder didn&#x2019;t give a shit about catching fish. This was something Milo knew the instant he saw him, the moment he heard that strange urgency in the carpet salesman&#x2019;s voice. About half of Milo&#x2019;s customers were like that; they paid heavy money for his time, fuel, and tackle, but they were there for something deeper and more difficult than amberjack or marlin. </p><p>This was Thing Two, the second part of Milo&#x2019;s job: professional wise man and counselor. </p><p>People came to him because they had problems they couldn&#x2019;t sort out on their own, and they had heard of him. Just as people in cartoons climbed mountains to find wise men, real people traveled serious distances to consult Milo aboard his boat, upon the sea, for the price of a half-day charter. </p><p>They were smart to do so. When you live almost ten thousand lives, after all, you can learn a great deal. Milo had squeezed so much learning and experience into his one, single soul that the knowledge had grown pressurized and hot, and transformed into wisdom the way coal changes into diamonds. His wisdom was like a superpower.</p><p>It showed in his eyes &#x2013; like green fire in outer space &#x2013; and in his tattooed skin, which was creased and furrowed as if his suntan had put down roots. </p><p>&#x201c;I really just want to talk to you about some stuff,&#x201d; Floyd admitted as they motored out of the marina.</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Milo.</p><p>Past the breakwater, a decent-sized swell lifted the <i>Loudermilk.</i> The kind that promised good surfing, later. He hoped Floyd was a fast talker.</p><p>Patience, his <i>boa</i> reminded him. Compassion.</p><p>Milo nodded, formed the <i>mudra</i> with his thumbs and forefingers, goosed the throttle, and steered out to sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Floyd Gamertsfelder was not a fast talker.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo was kind of hoping he&#x2019;d open up and spit out whatever his mystery problem was before they got too far out, but no. Floyd made his remark about wanting to talk, and then he just clammed up, watching the horizon, looking glum. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo wasn&#x2019;t surprised. It took time, usually. The puzzles people brought were hard-core and personal. They had to ride the waves awhile, before they opened up. They had to glimpse his outer space eyes and hear the ocean roll in his seaworthy, biker-dude voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milo nearly always took his customers to the same place, the same coordinates. Out of sight of land, an hour over open water, to a place only he knew about. In ninety feet of water, he dropped anchor directly over a forgotten submarine wreck, an artificial reef that hosted almost every species in the Gulf. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A dead man could catch his limit here,&#x201d; Milo told his customers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He and Floyd drifted around for two hours over the sub, ...</p></p><h2>Bartholomew&#39;s Passage : A Family Story for Advent</h2><p>Let the exciting story of Bartholmew&#x2019;s adventures prepare your family for Christmas! <p>Day by day through the Advent season, you and your family can prepare for Christmas by reading Bartholomew&#x2019;s spellbinding story.

W. Greasebeam presents a series of letters--by a ninth-century Viking, thirteenth-century Chinese girl, and a Prussian cartographer, among others--and colorful artwork recording the discovery of the world&#39;s most fearsome dragons. 60,000 first printing. $60,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Grade 4 Up-Adopting the persona of Rowland W. Greasebeam, B.Sc. (Serpentology) F.R.Aud., Base explores one of the animal kingdom's most exotic niches, presenting the stained, tattered letters of three (fictional) early dragon hunters, along with brief footnotes and a series of oversized, spectacularly detailed illustrations. All three individuals made their discoveries inadvertently: young Soong Mei Ying on a business trip to 13th-century Kathmanadu; 9th-century Viking Bjorn of Bromme on another sort of business trip to ancient Britain; and Dr. E. F. Liebermann, a contemporary of Darwin, on an ill-fated quest to prove that Africa, Tasmania, and Madagascar were once connected. All three find several dragon species, from the cat-sized Japanese Butterfly Lizard to Madagascar's gigantic and remarkably unsavory Common Green Draak. Though descriptions of each creature's appearance and habits tend to be general and understandably hasty first impressions, young readers will pick up all sorts of little-known facts: that few dragons breathe fire, for instance, and that many are vegetarians, including the infamous St. George Dragon, which "...can most commonly be seen in the remoter parts of Andalucia, lying in wait for passing grocery trucks." The letters are, fortunately, all written in English, and present no legibility problems; readers who skip them in favor of poring over the paintings, which appeared previously on a calendar, or the running frieze at the bottom, in which each correspondent's career is reprised, will find the art as tongue-in-cheek as the text, replete with toothy, scaled, but nonetheless seldom scary monsters. A browser's delight.<br><i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Embellishing colorplates that appeared in a 1990 calendar, and with his tongue resolutely in cheek, Base (The Sign of the Seahorse, 1992, etc.) narrates a mock-scientific treatise on serpentology in the voice of Victorian scientist Rowland W. Greasebeam, B.Sc., F.R.Aud., who claims to have located original letters (``from a variety of sources that propriety demands must remain confidential'') proving the discovery of dragons by a ninth- century Viking, a thirteenth-century Chinese maiden, and a fellow Victorian naturalist. In an oversize format, the letters appear as facsimiles, accompanied by spectacular full-color paintings of the dragons, with editorial notes, plate captions, maps, and scale drawings that compare the dragon in question to a horse, a mouse, an elephant, or--in one case--a human beating a quick retreat. Greasebeam's stuffy self-importance provides much of the fun; especially hilarious are references to his rival, Professor Marty Fibblewitz, that demonstrate in only slightly exaggerated form the legendary infighting among academics. The letters are full of silly details, such as this line in Viking Bjorn's letterhead: ``General Looting and Pillaging, Gratuitous Violence a Specialty.'' A cartoon sequence at the bottom of the spreads illustrates the ``plot'' of each letter and offers children a chance to read between the lines for funny subplots. Throughout, Base speaks for the scientists, author, editors, and the publisher, with wit that is accessible to children and that cannot be ignored by adults. A humorous, self-referential tour de force with resplendent illustrations. (Author tour) (Picture book. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Granite was her greatest lead dog, but he didn&#x2019;t start that way. He was a shy, scraggly pup that the others pushed around, but Susan saw his potential. Together they worked until he became leader of the team.<br>While they were training for the Iditarod, Granite became deathly ill. The veterinarians said he would never be strong enough to run the race. Granite refused to accept this, and slowly he started to recover. By the time of the race he was strong enough to start, but Susan wondered if he could finish the entire thousand-mile race. Confidently Granite guided the team into the lead of the race, when suddenly they were caught in a raging Arctic blizzard. Now Susan and the whole team depended on Granite to get them through the storm. He had to call on all his inner strength and courage to save them&#x2014;if he could.</p><p><b>Susan Butcher and David Monson</b> were married for twenty-one years. Together they raised and trained the dogs of Trail Breaker Kennel and achieved many vicotires in major sled dog races around the world. Susan won the Iditarod four times and finished in the top ten fifteen times. Granite was her lead dog for many of these races. She took a dog team to the summit of Denali, the highest peak in North America-this feat has never been repeated. David won the Yukon Quest in 1988 and he and Susan ran the Iditarod together three times.&nbsp;In August 2006, Susan died of leukemia. David lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, with their daughters, Tekla and Chisana. The three of them continue Susan's legacy of raising and training sled dogs, many of which are descendants of Granite.&nbsp;<b>Sarah Douglas </b>moved to Alaska in 1989 to work as a river guide and instantly felt that she had found her true home. She has been exploring the Great Land by kayak, dogsled, skis, and on foot ever since. The mountains, rivers, people wild creatures, and open spaces of the north provide endless inspiration for her artwork. Sarah makes hand-colored linoleum block prints that she hopes convey joy, timelessness, simplicity and peace.</p><h2>Calvin: A Novel</h2><p>Seventeen-year-old Calvin has always known his fate is linked to the comic book character from Calvin &amp; Hobbes. He was born on the day the last strip was published; his grandpa left a stuffed tiger named Hobbes in his crib; and he even has a best friend named Susie. As a child Calvin played with the toy Hobbes, controlling his every word and action, until Hobbes was washed to death. But now Calvin is a teenager who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, Hobbes is back&#x2015;as a delusion&#x2015;and Calvin can't control him. Calvin decides that if he can convince Bill Watterson to draw one final comic strip, showing a normal teenaged Calvin, he will be cured. Calvin and Susie (and Hobbes) set out on a dangerous trek across frozen Lake Erie to track him down.</p><p><b>Martine Leavitt</b> has written several award-winning novels for young adults, including <i>My Book of Life by</i> <i>Angel,</i> which garnered five starred reviews and was a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize finalist; <i>Keturah</i> <i>and Lord Death</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; and <i>Heck Superhero</i>, a finalist for the Governor General's Award. She lives in Alberta, Canada.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;Coincidences abound in Calvin's life: he was born on the day the last Calvin &amp; Hobbes cartoon strip was published, his grandpa gave him a stuffed tiger called Hobbes when he was a kid, and his best friend was even named Susie. However, she became beautiful and stopped being his friend. When Calvin is diagnosed with schizophrenia, he believes that Bill Watterson is the key to curing him of the illness and he must escape the hospital to meet the famously reclusive artist. The teen, along with an eight-foot-tall version of Hobbes (who is imaginary) and Susie (who may or may not be imaginary), journeys across frozen Lake Erie to track down Watterson. This is a gentle and unique story about a boy struggling with schizophrenia; while Calvin is indeed having grandiose visions that include a beloved cartoon character, he is funny, charming, and smart. Even though Calvin's stream-of-consciousness rants can drag the story down, the premise that Susie may or may not be on this dangerous trek with the protagonist will keep readers interested. There are genuinely beautiful moments in the writing throughout; however, the ending is too pat and feels contrived, which will leave some readers unsatisfied. VERDICT Sweet, romantic, and funny, but flawed.&#x2014;Laura Lutz, Convent of the Sacred Heart, New York City</p><h2>Protestants: The Faith That Made the Modern World</h2><p><b>On the 500th anniversary of Luther&#x2019;s theses, a landmark history of the revolutionary faith that shaped the modern world.&nbsp;</b><br><br>"Ryrie writes that his aim 'is to persuade you that we cannot understand the modern age without understanding the dynamic history of Protestant Christianity.' To which I reply: Mission accomplished."<b><br><b>&#x2013;Jon Meacham, author of&nbsp;<i>American Lion</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Thomas Jefferson</i></b><br></b><br>Five hundred years ago a stubborn German monk challenged the Pope with a radical vision of what Christianity could be. The revolution he set in motion toppled governments, upended social norms and transformed millions of people's understanding of their relationship with God. In this dazzling history, Alec Ryrie makes the case that we owe many of the rights and freedoms we have cause to take for granted--from free speech to limited government--to our Protestant roots.<br><br>Fired up by their faith, Protestants have embarked on courageous journeys into the unknown like many rebels and refugees who made their way to our shores. Protestants created America and defined its special brand of entrepreneurial diligence. Some turned to their bibles to justify bold acts of political opposition, others to spurn orthodoxies and insight on their God-given rights. Above all Protestants have fought for their beliefs, establishing a tradition of principled opposition and civil disobedience that is as alive today as it was 500 years ago. In this engrossing and magisterial work, Alec Ryrie makes the case that whether or not you are yourself a Protestant, you live in a world shaped by Protestants.</p><p><b>Alec Ryrie</b>&nbsp;was born in London and grew up in Washington DC. He graduated from Cambridge University with a double First in History and received a doctorate in Theology from Oxford University. He is now Professor of the History of Christianity at Durham University and a licensed minister in his local church. An expert on the Reformation in England and Scotland, he is the author of the prizewinning&nbsp;<i>Being Protestant in Reformation Britain</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Sorcerer's Tale: Faith and Fraud in Tudor England</i>&nbsp;and is co-editor of the<i>&nbsp;Journal of Ecclesiastical History.</i>Chapter 1<br><br> Luther and the Fanatics<br><br> If God be for us, who can be against us?<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-Romans 8:31<br><br> Everyone knew how it was supposed to end. The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, headed on earth by the bishop of Rome, the successor of Saint Peter and vicar of Christ, had endured in Europe for over a thousand years. Nothing survives that long by accident. For Christians in the early sixteenth century who reflected on that astonishing fact, the explanation was obvious. This was no human institution. It was the visible Body of its founder, guided by the Holy Spirit. It would outlast this fading world and the carping of its critics, enduring forever to God's glory.<br><br> Nowadays, we prefer more mundane explanations. Catholic Christendom was flexible and creative, a walled garden with plenty of scope for novelty and variety, and room to adapt to changing political, social, and economic climates. But it also had boundaries, marked and unmarked. Those who wandered too far would be urged, and if necessary forced, to come back.<br><br> So if a professor at a small German university questioned an archbishop's fund-raising practices, there was a limited range of possible outcomes. The archbishop might ignore it or quietly concede the point. Or the professor might be induced to back down, by one means or another. If none of this happened, the matter would be contested on a bigger stage. Perhaps one party or the other in the debate would persuade his opponent to agree with him. Or, more likely, the process would be mired in procedure until the protagonists gave up or died. But if it reached an impasse, the troublesome professor would eventually be ordered to give way. In the unlikely event that he refused, the only recourse was the law, leading to the one outcome that nobody wanted: he could be executed as an impenitent heretic, in a fire that would purge Christendom of his errors and symbolize the hell to which he had willfully condemned himself.<br><br> This system had worked for centuries. But in 1517, when that professor, Martin Luther, challenged Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz, his challenge instead kindled a series of increasingly uncontrollable wildfires that swept away many of the Catholic Church's ancient structures and its walls. We call this firestorm the Reformation and the new form, or forms, of Christianity that emerged from it Protestantism.<br><br> This was not what Luther had intended. When he voiced his local protest, he was not trying to start a fire. He was working out the implications of his own recent spiritual breakthrough and trying to start an argument about it. It turned out that those implications reached much further than either he or his opponents initially imagined. Once the smoke began to clear, they were forced to realize that they were in a new world.<br><br> The Call of Reform<br><br> With hindsight, we can see that Luther's fire caught because fuel had been quietly building up for some time. The principal fuel was desire for reform of the church.<br><br> Churches always need reform. They are staffed by human beings, some of whom will inevitably be fools, knaves, or merely incompetents. The church of the later Middle Ages was no more "corrupt" than usual, and in many ways much less so. Yet three problems converged to make it appear worse than it was: money, power, and high principle.<br><br> The Western church was very rich. It had to be; it was responsible for a continental network of parish priests, church buildings, and monastic houses, supported by an international bureaucracy of unparalleled sophistication, and these things do not come cheap. It had to preserve its political independence in a dangerous world, which meant choosing leaders of royal and noble stock. These were men-and some women, the great abbesses-whose dignity and effectiveness in their offices depended on maintaining the high courtly style to which they had been born.<br><br> Yet this was also an age that actively valued poverty, lauding it as a positive virtue like no Christian society before or since. The ideal late medieval cleric was a friar, who was forbidden even to touch money and who was supposed not even to own the rough clothes on his back. The contrast between that ideal and the church's corporate wealth was disturbing. Surely all that money must be corrupting? Once, as a rueful proverb had it, golden priests had served from wooden chalices; now wooden priests served from golden chalices. Every time the church extracted rents, tithes, or other payments from its flock, it fed a resentment that went beyond ordinary taxpayers' grumbles. And when there were real or perceived financial abuses, the gap between high ideals and sordid reality yawned dangerously wide. Martin Luther was a friar as well as a professor. When a man in his position accused the church of moneygrubbing, people were ready to listen.<br><br> Then there was power. Back in the eleventh century, the popes had wriggled free from political control and established a vigilantly guarded independence. By the fifteenth century, they had quietly dropped some of their more startling claims. In theory, they were lords of Christendom, able to depose kings and demand universal obedience, but they knew not to push their luck. They had never really recovered from the ghastly schism of 1378-1417, when Europe was split between first two and then three rival popes. The schism was ended by a great reforming church council, which seemed to promise an era of renewal-a hope that slowly evaporated over the following decades, leaving a residue of bitterness. By 1500, virtually all Western Christians acknowledged the papacy, but they were not proud of it. Eye-popping tales were told about Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503), Rodrigo Borgia, who in 1501 supposedly held an orgy in the papal apartments for his son, to which he invited fifty chosen prostitutes and select senior clerics. True or not, it was widely believed.<br><br> Inadequate leadership and financial corruption make a dangerous mix. All the more so in "Germany," the vast, north-central European territories that fell loosely under the so-called Holy Roman emperor. The rivalry between popes and emperors was ancient, and as the papal court became dominated almost exclusively by Italians after the schism, it seemed increasingly foreign north of the Alps. National stereotypes came into play. Germans were, in their own minds, bluff, honest, easily duped, but firm in the defense of the right. Italians, by contrast, were scheming, malevolent, effeminate, avaricious, and cowardly. So when a German friar accused Italians of extortion and tyranny, German ears were ready to hear him.<br><br> There was also a matter of principle at stake. As well as some memorable popes, the Renaissance gave Western Christendom a slogan: ad fontes, "to the sources," an urge to return to the ancient, and therefore pure, founts of truth. By 1500, this fashion for antiquity was sweeping into every field of knowledge. Renaissance linguists tried to recover the glories of Cicero. Renaissance generals tried, with dubious success, to remodel their armies as Roman legions. The problem with the ancient world was that it happened a long time ago, and reconstructing it involved guesswork. But late medieval Europeans never doubted that it had been a world of pristine perfection. They measured their own age against that imagined ideal. Inevitably, it fell short. And so the most devastating critiques of the late medieval church came not from the discontented or marginalized but from within: from powerful establishment figures who believed in an ideal church and who would not hide their disappointment with the reality. They wanted to renew the church, not destroy it.<br><br> Leading these critics was the age's intellectual colossus, Erasmus of Rotterdam, a brilliant, sharp-tongued, penny-pinching, peripatetic monk who combined a deliberately simple piety, an acid wit, and a finely judged sense of when and with whom to pick a fight. The wit was displayed in his satire The Praise of Folly (1509), which told his readers that almost every aspect of the world they lived in was ridiculous. The piety and shrewdness were seen in his pathbreaking 1516 Latin translation of the New Testament from the original Greek. Its preface recommended that the Bible be made available in all languages so that it could be read even by those on the very extremes of Christian civilization: the wild Scots, the Irish, even-he strained himself-women. Characteristically, he wrote that dangerous preface in Latin. He knew what he could get away with. He also knew that the content of his New Testament mattered less than the fact of its existence. He was offering the chance to use the Bible to judge the church.<br><br> The church's old guard was duly provoked. Erasmus himself always stayed on the right side of trouble, but others were less careful and more vulnerable. The great cause c l bre of early sixteenth-century Germany was Johannes Reuchlin, a pioneer of Christian Hebrew scholarship. Unfortunately, the only people who could teach Christians Hebrew were Jews, and late medieval Christians generally hated and despised Jews. Reuchlin, however, both was openly friendly with certain Jews and acknowledged his debt to Jewish biblical scholarship. Inevitably, he was denounced for crypto-Judaism, which the church regarded as heresy. His denouncer, with grim irony, was a Jewish convert to Christianity. German Renaissance scholars rallied to his defense, viciously mocking his opponents as self-serving obscurantists. For them, this was a war between fearless, cutting-edge German scholarship and corrupt, ignorant Italian power politics. The court case dragged on until 1516, and even then it was merely suspended; Reuchlin was never formally cleared. In the court of public opinion, however, the new scholarship was triumphantly vindicated, and the brethren sharpened their pens in readiness for the next skirmish. Enter Martin Luther.<br><br> An Accidental Revolutionary<br><br> Martin Luther was the Reformation's indispensable firestarter. Would there have been a Reformation if young Martin had followed his father's wishes and become a lawyer? Who knows, but the Reformation as it actually happened is unimaginable without him.<br><br> Luther does not fit the stereotype of a great Christian revolutionary. He never held high office, and he remained a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg to the end of his life, squeezing his revolution in between his regular lectures. He was not a man of heroic virtues. He was grouchy, obstinate, and an unabashed sensualist, from his boisterous, flirtatious, and deeply affectionate marriage to his well-documented fondness for Saxon beer. In later life, he was frankly fat, and for most of his life he struggled with constipation. Fittingly enough, his religion was a matter less of the mind than of the heart and the gut. Spiritually as well as physically, he was larger than life. Even his flaws were outsized. His piercing insights, his raw honesty, and the shattering spiritual experiences that drove his life still leap off the page five centuries later. They do so because they resonate with the modern age, an age that he made.<br><br> Luther was born in 1483 or 1484, the eldest son of a family that was newly prosperous from copper mining. He became a monk in 1505, against his father's wishes, and remembered those early years in the monastery as a torment. He felt imprisoned in his own sin, whose grip on him grew stronger the more he struggled against it. Seemingly trivial sins tortured him. His exasperated confessor told him to go and commit some real sins, but his superior, more constructively, packed him off to the new university at Wittenberg for further study in 1507. He drank in his studies. Over the following dozen years, as he rose rapidly in both the monastic and the academic hierarchies, he gradually came to understand the Christian Gospel in a way that seemed to him completely new, authentically ancient, and utterly life changing.<br><br> Luther was not a systematic theologian, trading in logical definitions or philosophical consistency. The systematizers who followed in his wake picked out two key principles in his thought: sola fide and sola scriptura, "faith alone" and "Scripture alone." But this risks missing the point. Luther's theology was not a doctrine; it was a love affair. Consuming love for God has been part of Christian experience since the beginning, but Luther's passion had a reckless extravagance that set it apart, and which has echoed down Protestantism's history. He pursued his love for God with blithe disregard for the bounds set by church and tradition. It was an intense, desolating, intoxicating passion, sparked by his life-upending glimpse of God's incomprehensible, terrible, beautiful love for him. Like any lover, he found it incredible that his beloved should love him, unworthy as he was. And yet he discovered over the long years of prayer and study that God loved him wildly, irresponsibly, and beyond all reason. God, in Christ, had laid down his life for him. This was not, as the medievals' subtle theology had taught, a transaction, or a process by which believers had to do whatever was in their power to pursue holiness. It was a sheer gift. All that mattered was accepting it.<br><br> This went beyond anything Erasmus had imagined. Erasmus wanted to free Christians from superstition, not to interfere with Christianity's basic theological framework. Indeed, he thought that too much attention to theology was a futile distraction from the pursuit of holiness. He called Luther doctor hyperbolicus, the "doctor of overstatement." But for Luther, it was impossible to overstate God's grace. He too wanted a radically simplified Christian life, but he wanted it because the flood of God's grace had swept everything else away. All the structures that the medieval church had provided for the Christian life, from pious works through sacraments to the church itself, mediating between sinners and their Savior-all of this was now so much clutter. Or worse, a blasphemous attempt to buy and sell what God gives us for free.<br><br> This talk of grace and free forgiveness was dangerous. If grace is free and all we need do is believe, surely that would lead to moral anarchy? The fact that free forgiveness can look like a license to sin has plagued Protestantism for centuries. But for Luther, even to ask this question was blockheaded. What kind of lover needs rules about how to love? What kind of lover has to be bribed or threatened into loving? God loves us unreservedly. If we recognize that love, we will love him unreservedly in return.<br><br> Luther's breakthrough had a dazzling, corrosive simplicity to it. The power of those twin principles, "faith alone" and "Scripture alone," lay in the word "alone." There is nothing and no one else other than God incarnate in Jesus Christ worth attending to. Being a Christian means throwing yourself abjectly, unreservedly, on Christ's mercy. Living a Christian life means living Christ's life-that is, abandoning all security and worldly ambitions to follow him "through penalties, deaths and hell." It is only then that we may find peace. That ravishing paradox is at the heart of Protestantism. It is a further paradox that such a profoundly personal insight should have such an impact on the outside world.</p><h2>The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic</h2><p><p>John Shelby Spong, bestselling author and popular proponent of a modern, scholarly and authentic Christianity, argues that this last gospel to be written was misinterpreted by the framers of the fourth-century creeds to be a literal account of the life of Jesus when in fact it is a literary, interpretive retelling of the events in Jesus' life through the medium of fictional characters, from Nicodemus and Lazarus to the "Beloved Disciple." The Fourth Gospel was designed first to place Jesus into the context of the Jewish scriptures, then to place him into the worship patterns of the synagogue and finally to allow him to be viewed through the lens of a popular form of first-century Jewish mysticism.</p><p>The result of this intriguing study is not only to recapture the original message of this gospel, but also to provide us today with a radical new dimension to the claim that in the humanity of Jesus the reality of God has been met and engaged.</p></p><p><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world.
